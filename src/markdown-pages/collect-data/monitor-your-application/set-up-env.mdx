This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to monitor your application with New Relic. If you haven't already, check out the [lab introduction](/collect-data/monitor-your-application).

</Callout>

Before you can walk through the lab proper, you need to spin up your Angular application.

<Steps>

<Step>

Clone the lab repository:

<>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/NewRelic-basics-lab-material.git
```

</>

</Step>

<Step>

Navigate to the root directory of your application, install dependencies, and run the application:

<>

```bash
cd NewRelic-basics-lab-material/FoodMe
npm install
node ./server/start.js
[output] Go to http://localhost:3000/
```

</>

This opens your FoodMe application in your browser.

Enter your name and delivery address, and click **Find Restaurants** to get started.

![nearby restaurant list](../../../images/foodme/restaurant-list.png)

Here, you see a list of restaurants where you can order food.

</Step>

<Step>

Choose a restaurant.

![choose a restaurant](../../../images/foodme/choose-restaurant.png)

</Step>

<Step>

Select an item or two.

![select food](../../../images/foodme/select-food.png)

</Step>

<Step>

Click **Checkout**.

Next, you use simulator to generate more traffic to your application.

</Step>

<Step>

In another terminal window, navigate to root directory of your application and run the load generator:

<>

```bash animate
cd NewRelic-basics-lab-material/FoodMe/simulator
pip install selenium
python simulator.py
[output] ====== WebDriver manager ======
[output] Current google-chrome version is 99.0.4844
[output] Get LATEST chromedriver version for 99.0.4844 google-chrome
```

</>

<Callout variant='important'>

The load generator assumes Google Chrome as your default browser and installs compatible WebDriver. If you're using a different browser, you can skip this step and generate traffic manually.

</Callout>

</Step>

</Steps>

Now, that you know how to run your application, it's time to instrument it. In the terminal window that's running your application, press `<CTRL-C>` to shut down your application. With your app shut down, you'll be able to update your code to introduce monitoring tools.
