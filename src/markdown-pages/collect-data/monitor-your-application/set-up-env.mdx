This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to monitor your application with New Relic. If you haven't already, check out the [lab introduction](/collect-data/monitor-your-application).

Before you can walk through the lab proper, you need to spin up your Angular application. 

<Steps>

<Step>

Clone the lab repository:

<>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/NewRelic-basics-lab-material.git
```

</>

</Step>

<Step>

Navigate to the root directory of your application, install dependencies, and run the application:

<>

```bash
cd NewRelic-basics-lab-material/FoodMe
npm install
node ./server/start.js
[output] Go to http://localhost:3000/
```

</>

This opens your FoodMe application in browser.

Now that you've got your application running, it's time to instrument it.
