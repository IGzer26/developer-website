<Intro>

Youâ€™re the new IT engineer for Geek's Movie Shop, a site that's deployed across a distributed infrastructure. Your predecessors didn't instrument your servers, so you're in the dark with how they're behaving. However, your users are complaining, so it's time to turn on the lights.

In this track, you use New Relic infrastructure to observe your entire infrastructure so you can identify and mitigate issues. Specifically, you use the Host view to see how your system is degrading. Then, you discover how the services that are running on your hosts are affecting the hosts, themselves.

</Intro>

## Objectives

- Instrument your hosts with the New Relic infrastructure agent
- Gather insights from your infrastructure and related services
- Identify root cause issues in your infrastructure

## Requirements

- A free New Relic account
