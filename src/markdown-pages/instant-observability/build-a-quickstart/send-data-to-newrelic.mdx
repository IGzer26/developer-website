This lesson is a part of lab that teaches you to build quickstart. If you haven't already, checkout the introduction to [_build a quickstart_](/instant-observability/build-a-quickstart/index)

Before you build a quickstart, you need to spin up demo services. The lab depends on two important services:
- A python program that mimics the database and also provides functions for CRUD operations.
- A simulator service that generates dummy database traffic and performs CRUD operations.
To spin up demo services, you first need to install Docker and also set **NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY** environment variable.

> **Note:** **NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY** environment variable is your New Relic liscence key. [You can find your New Relic liscence key in your New Relic account](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/). 

### Spin up demo services

Clone the lab repository from GitHub: 
>```bash
> git clone https://github.com/mehreentahir16/FlashDB.git
>``` 

This repository contains the code for flashdb as well as the simulator for dummy database traffic. Navigate to the demo directory and execute the following commands to build and run docker image.

> ```bash
> docker build -t flashdb . 
> docker run flashdb
>```

The above application supply the mock database traffic that we will observe in New Relic with the help of New Relic telemetry sdk. Once the docker image is up and running, you see the following output in your terminal.

>**Important**
>Make sure you set NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY with your actual [license key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/new-relic-license-key/) to see the above output.

The next step is to observe this data in New Relic.
