Youâ€™ve developed a new database called flashDB, the lightest and fastest database in the space. Your database is already very popular among the developers. Now, you want to help users of flashDB to quickly and easily observe it in New Relic.

To achieve your goal, contribute a quickstart to New Relic I/O so other users can quickly monitor flashDB.

New Relic One quickstarts provide immediate value for your specific use case. They include:
- Clear instructions for instrumenting your services
- Observbility building blocks like dashboards and alerts

New Relic allow you to collect, monitor, and report data from different sources. While we offer a large variety of open-source integrations for telemetry tools, you can also use Telemetry SDKs to create your own telemetry data solutions. You can use New Relic One dashboards to view, explore, customize, understand, and correlate the data you collect using different user-friendly charts. You can also set alert policies to monitor key performance metrics and receive notification for anomalies. 

Until now, you had to custom build these solutions to observe your applications in New Relic but New Relic now allow you to create and contribute **quickstarts** to help you and others quickly and easily observe it in New Relic. 

Throughout this lab, you'll build a custom solution to observe flashdb in New Relic, package the solution as quickstart and contribute it to help others observe flashdb. 

## Learning Objectives

- Create New Relic dashboards to get insights from Database transactions (response time, errors, cache hits, cache miss, read/write error etc.)
- Create New Relic Alerts ( high response time, high error rate etc.)
- Write related documentation 
- Package the dashboard, alerts and related documentation into a quickstart

This lesson is a part of lab that teaches you to build quickstart. Before you proceed, make sure you have a New Relic Account. Continue on to first lesson: [_Send data to New Relic_](/instant-observability/build-a-quickstart/send-data-to-newrelic)
