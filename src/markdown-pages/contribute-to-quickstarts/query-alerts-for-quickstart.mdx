<Intro>

With a quickstart, you let your users quickly install dashboards, alerts, and other resources. Here, you learn how to use New Relic's GraphQL API, [NerdGraph](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql), to query your existing alert conditions and configure them in your quickstart.

</Intro>

<Callout variant="important">

This guide assumes you already have alerts in your New Relic account and a quickstart that you want to add those alerts to. If you don't already have a quickstart, follow [our lab](/contribute-to-quickstarts/build-a-quickstart) to learn how to build one.

</Callout>

## Build a query in NerdGraph

Open the [NerdGraph API explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) and select your key from the dropdown menu.

![graphiql interface](../../images/query-alerts/nerdgraph-interface.png)

Check the appropriate boxes to build a GraphQL query.

![build a query](../../images/query-alerts/build-query.png)

This updates the GraphQL query in the center pane of the explorer.

```js
{
  actor {
    account(id: REPLACE_ACCOUNT_ID) {
      alerts {
        nrqlCondition(id: "") {
          nrql {
            query
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace your account ID and condition ID in the above query to get the details of your alert condition. By using the UI, the explorer automatically inserts your account ID, but you need to look up your alert condition's ID.

In your [New Relic homepage](https://one.newrelic.com/), go to **Alerts & AI**.

![Alerts & AI](../../images/query-alerts/alerts-and-ai.png)
 
Click **Policies** in left hand navigation. 

![Policies](../../images/query-alerts/policies.png)

Here, choose your policy from the list and click on the corresponding condition to get its ID. 

![alert condition](../../images/query-alerts/alert-conditions.png)

![get alert condition id](../../images/query-alerts/alert-id.png)

The next few sections cover how to:

 - Query an existing static alert in NerdGraph
 - Query an existing baseline alert in NerdGraph
 - Query an existing outlier alert in NerdGraph

## Query an existing static alert in NerdGraph

Check the appropriate boxes to build the following query for existing static alert in NerdGraph.

![NRQL static alert query](../../images/query-alerts/nrql-static-alert-query.png)

For reference, this updates the GraphQL query as follow:

```js
{
  actor {
    account(id: REPLACE_ACCOUNT_ID) {
      alerts {
        nrqlCondition(id: REPLACE_CONDITION_ID) {
          ... on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition {
            id
            name
            type
            nrql {
              query
            }
            valueFunction
            terms {
              operator
              priority
              threshold
              thresholdDuration
              thresholdOccurrences
            }
            violationTimeLimitSeconds
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Execute the query to get a JSON representation of the specified static condition that you can use to update your quickstart. 

![static alert query](../../images/query-alerts/static-query-response.png)

Use the _static-alert.yml_ file from quickstart template and populate it using the information returned from above query.

```yml
---

# Name of the alert
name: Static Condition

# Description and details
details: |+
  This alert is triggered whenever the host count is < 2.

# Type of alert
type: STATIC

# NRQL query
nrql:
  query: "SELECT uniqueCount(host) FROM Transaction"

# Function used to aggregate the NRQL query value(s) for comparison to the terms.threshold (Default: SINGLE_VALUE)
valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE

# List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition
terms:
- priority: CRITICAL
  # Operator used to compare against the threshold.
  operator: BELOW
  # Value that triggers a violation
  threshold: 2
  # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600
  thresholdDuration: 300
  # How many data points must be in violation for the duration
  thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE

# Duration after which a violation automatically closes
# Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day])
violationTimeLimitSeconds: 259200

```

Here, you added the pre-existing static alert to the quickstart. Follow the same procedure to add baseline and outlier alerts. 

## Query an existing baseline alert in NerdGraph

Check the appropriate boxes to build the following query for baseline alert in NerdGraph.

![NRQL baseline alert query](../../images/query-alerts/nrql-baseline-alert-query.png)

Here, you checked the box for AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition. For reference, following is the GraphQL query.

```js
{
  actor {
    account(id: REPLACE_ACCOUNT_ID) {
      alerts {
        nrqlCondition(id: REPLACE_CONDITION_ID) {
          ... on AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition {
            id
            name
            nrql {
              query
            }
            baselineDirection
            terms {
              priority
              threshold
              thresholdDuration
              thresholdOccurrences
            }
            violationTimeLimitSeconds
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

This returns you the JSON representation of the specified baseline condition. 

![baseline alert query response](../../images/query-alerts/baseline-query-response.png)

Use the _baseline-alert.yml_ file from quickstart template and populate it using the information returned from above query.

```yml
---

# Name of the alert
name: Baseline Condition

# Description and details
details: |+
  This alert is triggered whenever the average Transaction duration deviates 2 standard deviations from the normal.

# Type of alert
type: BASELINE

# NRQL query
nrql:
  # Baseline alerts can use an optional FACET
  query: "SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction"

# Direction in which baseline is set (Default: LOWER_ONLY)
baselineDirection: UPPER_ONLY

# List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition
terms:
- priority: CRITICAL
  # Value that triggers a violation
  threshold: 2
  # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600, must be a multiple of 60 for Baseline conditions
  thresholdDuration: 180
  # How many data points must be in violation for the duration
  thresholdOccurrences: ALL 

# Duration after which a violation automatically closes
# Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day])
violationTimeLimitSeconds: 259200

```
Here, you added an existing baseline alert to your quickstart.

## Query an existing outlier alert in NerdGraph

Check the appropriate boxes to build query for outlier alert in NerdGraph.

![NRQL outlier alert query](../../images/query-alerts/nrql-outlier-alert-query.png)

Note here, that we check the box for AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition. This updates the following GraphQL query.

```js
{
  actor {
    account(id: REPLACE_ACCOUNT_ID) {
      alerts {
        nrqlCondition(id: REPLACE_CONDITION_ID) {
          ... on AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition {
            id
            name
            nrql {
              query
            }
            expectedGroups
            terms {
              priority
              threshold
              thresholdDuration
              thresholdOccurrences
            }
            violationTimeLimitSeconds
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```
Execute the above query to get the JSON representation of the specified outlier condition that you can use to update your quickstart. 

![outlier alert query response](../../images/query-alerts/outlier-query-response.png)

Use the _outlier-alert.yml_ file from quickstart template and populate it using the information returned from above query.

```yml
---

# Name of the alert
name: Outlier Condition

# Description and details
details: |+
  This alert is triggered when any facet(s) deviate from the center of the group for at least 5 mins

# Type of alert
type: OUTLIER

# NRQL query
nrql:
  # Outlier alerts require FACET
  query: "SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET http.statusCode"

# Number of groups expected in the returned values for the condition (Default: 2)
expectedGroups: 4

# List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition
terms:
- priority: CRITICAL
  # Value that triggers a violation
  threshold: 1
  # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600
  thresholdDuration: 300
  # How many data points must be in violation for the duration
  thresholdOccurrences: ALL 

# Duration after which a violation automatically closes
# Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day])
violationTimeLimitSeconds: 2592000

```

Here, you added an outlier alert to your quickstart.
