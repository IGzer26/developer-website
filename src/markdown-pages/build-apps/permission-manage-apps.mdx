<Intro>

Understand the requirements for managing and using Nerdpacks in New Relic One.

</Intro>

## Capabilities at a glance

Your ability to manage and use Nerdpacks depends on your user's:

- Model (original or New Relic One model)
- Type
- Role

Whether you're on the [original user model](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/) or the [New Relic One user model](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/), review the tables below for a summary of user Nerdpack capabilities.

### Original user model

If your organization was created before July 30, 2020 and you haven't transitioned to our New Relic One pricing model, you're on the [original pricing plan](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing/). Capabilities for our [original user model](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/) differ from those of our [new user model](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/):

| | Basic user | Full user without the Nerdpack Manager add-on role | Full user with the Nerdpack Manager add-on role | Owner/Admin user |
|:--|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Serve Nerdpacks | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Publish Nerdpacks | no | no | yes | yes |
| Subscribe to Nerdpacks | no | no | yes | yes |
| Tag Nerdpacks | no | no | yes | yes |
| Use Nerdlets or visualizations created by the user's accounts | no | yes | yes | yes |
| Use Nerdlets created by New Relic | no* | yes | yes | yes |
| Use visualizations created by New Relic | no | yes | yes | yes |

_* There are a few Nerdlets that basic users are allowed to use. See [Basic users](#basic-users) for more information._

### New Relic One user model

If your organization is part of the [New Relic One pricing model](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/), the user types, privileges, and capabilities are different than those of our original user model:

| | Basic user | Full user |
|---|---|---|
| Serve Nerdpacks | yes | yes |
| Publish Nerdpacks | no | yes |
| Subscribe to Nerdpacks | no | yes |
| Tag Nerdpacks | no | yes |
| Use Nerdlets or visualizations created by the user's accounts | no | yes |
| Use Nerdlets created by New Relic | no* | yes |
| Use visualizations created by New Relic | no | yes |

_* There are a few Nerdlets that basic users are allowed to use. See [Basic users](#basic-users-1) for more information._

## Nerdpack permissions: Original user model

Learn the differences between how basic users, full users, and admins can use and manage Nerdpacks in the [original user model](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/).

### Basic users

Basic users in the original user model are limited in their Nerdpack capabilities. They can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally. To publish, tag, subscribe to, and use their Nerdpacks, a basic user must be upgraded to a full user. An admin user on their account can do this for them.

<Callout variant="tip">

While, in general, a basic user can't use Nerdpacks, even ones that their accounts create and publish, there are some Nerdlets that New Relic maintains that basic users can use. However, these are rare and there is currently no way to distinguish them in our web interface. And even if a basic user is allowed to use a Nerdlet in a Nerdpack, they are never able to use custom visualizations. To use custom visualizations, a user must be at least a full user.

</Callout>

### Full users

Full users in the original user model fit into two categories:

- Those who have been granted the **Nerdpack Manager** add-on role
- Those who have not been granted the **Nerdpack Manager** add-on role

The **Nerdpack Manager** role is required to publish, subscribe to, and tag Nerdpacks. So a full user who doesn't have the **Nerdpack Manager** role is only allowed to create and serve Nerdpacks locally and use Nerdpacks that their accounts have already been subscribed to.

To publish, tag, or subscribe to a Nerdpack, a full user must be either upgraded to an admin user or granted the **Nerdpack Manager** add-on role by an admin.

A full user with the **Nerdpack Manager** role can perform any of the Nerdpack capabilities and is, therefore, equivalent to an owner or admin within the context of Nerdpacks.

### Owner/Admin users

An owner or admin user can perform any of the Nerdpack capabilities, including creating, serving, publishing, tagging, subscribing to, and using any and all Nerdpack artifacts, both Nerdlets and visualizations, either built by New Relic or by their own accounts.

## Nerdpack permissions: New Relic One user model

Learn the differences between how basic users and full users can use and manage Nerdpacks in the [New Relic One user model](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/).

### Basic users

Like in the original user model, basic users in the New Relic One user model are limited in their Nerdpack capabilities. They can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally. To publish, tag, subscribe to, and use their Nerdpacks, a basic user must be upgraded to a full user by an admin.

<Callout variant="tip">

While, in general, a basic user can't use Nerdpacks, even ones that their accounts create and publish, there are some Nerdlets that New Relic maintains that basic users can use. However, these are rare and there is currently no way to distinguish them in our web interface. And even if a basic user is allowed to use a Nerdlet in a Nerdpack, they are never able to use custom visualizations. To use custom visualizations, a user must be at least a full user.

</Callout>

### Full users

Full users in the New Relic One user model fit into two categories:

- Those who have been granted the **Nerdpacks "modify"** privilege
- Those who have not been granted the **Nerdpacks "modify"** privilege

The **Nerdpacks "modify"** privilege is required to publish, subscribe to, and tag Nerdpacks. So a full user who doesn't have the **Nerdpacks "modify"** privilege is only allowed to create and serve Nerdpacks locally and use Nerdpacks that their accounts have already been subscribed to.

So to publish, tag, or subscribe to your Nerdpack, an admin must grant you the **Nerdpacks "modify"** privilege.

<Callout variant="tip">

The Nerdpacks "modify" privilege is included in both the **User** and **Admin** groups, the only groups available by default. So in most cases, a full user has the ability to manage Nerdpacks. However, if an admin creates a custom group that does not include this privilege, full users assigned to that custom group won't be able to manage Nerdpacks.

</Callout>

## Master/Sub-account Capabilities

Some accounts, called master accounts, have sub-accounts that report data back up to them. This organizational hierarchy affects Nerdpack capabilities.

In general, the flow of control moves downstream:

![Master/Sub-account example](../../images/build-an-app/master-sub-accounts-nerdpacks.png)

In this example scenario **A**, the master account publishes a Nerdpack. This means that all three accounts, **Master**, **Account 1**, and **Account 2**, can subscribe to it. If the master account subscribes to the Nerdpack, then all three accounts can use it. If **Account 1** subscribes to it, only **Account 1** can use it, because neither **Master** nor **Account 2** is downstream in the hierarchy.

In scenario **B**, the sub-account, **Account 1**, publishes a Nerdpack, so neither **Master** nor **Account 2** can subscribe to it or use it.
