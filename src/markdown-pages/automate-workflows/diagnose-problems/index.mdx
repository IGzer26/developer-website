<Intro>

You're a developer of Acme Telco Lite, a mock telecom business that maintains an eCommerce website for its customers. When deploying your application, you hope it's efficient and error free. The reality, however, is quite different. Your users are complaining of slow response and errors. You use New Relic to figure out the source of your user's frustration.

</Intro>

Your customers were happy with their experience. However, you have been receiving complains for bad user experience after the recent deployment. You don't know if there's a bug in the release, an overlooked edge case, or a broken dependency causing the issue. But you know that you can use New Relic to observe your application and quickly diagnose the issue. This helps you take in-time action and get back on track.
