This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to track full stack errors using errors inbox.

Each procedure in the lab builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last procedure, [Triage your errors](/automate-workflows/error-inbox/triage-errors), before starting this one.

</Callout>

You're now observing all the errors in errors inbox and you're trying to debug your application ASAP so you could make your site live. You also want to keep a track of all the triaged errors so you could track progress and (optionally) create tasks to resolve the other errors.

By default, errors inbox show all the unresolved errors on the main screen. Once the error status is updated to resolved or ignored, you no longer see the error on the main screen. However, You can change the filter to view your triaged errors.

In this procedure, you view your triaged errors and (optionally) integrate Jira with errors inbox.

## View triaged errors

Change the filter in errors inbox to view your triaged errors:

The main screen of errors inbox has a filter pane right below the top nav.

Here, you see three options in the dropdown. Select **Resolved**.

Your errors inbox now show all the resolved error groups, if any.
![resolved error groups](../../../images/error-inbox/resolved-error-groups.png)

You don't see any error group here because none of the errors were marked resolved. If this was your real world application, you could resolve the error, mark the error as resolved and track your resolved errors here.

<Callout variant='tip'>

If you want to observe your ignored error groups instead of resolved, you could set the filter to **Ignored** here. Ignored filter show all the ignored error groups, if any, in errors inbox.
