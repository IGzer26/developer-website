This procedure is part of a lab that teaches you how to track full stack errors using Error Inbox. If you haven't already, check out the [lab introduction](/automate-workflows/error-inbox).

</Callout>

Geek's Movie Shop (former Stan's Robot Shop) is a web application that consists of several interconnected microservices like cart, catalogue, payment, user, and more. These services are instrumented with New Relic for performance monitoring and full visibility across all layers. The application also has a loader service that generates traffic In this lab, we use New Relic's Error Inbox for full stack error tracking.

## Set up your environment

Before you begin with the lab, set up your development environment. 
<Steps>
<Step>
Clone the lab repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/error-inbox-lab-material.git
```

</Step>
<Step>

Open the cloned repo in your IDE and create a _.env_ file from _env.template_ and set these variables:

```
DOCKERHUB_USER=username
TAG=latest
CLUSTER_NAME=local
PUBLIC_URL=http://docker-for-desktop:8888

NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=<YOUR_LISCENCE_KEY>
```

Here, NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY is your liscence key for New Relic account. Your application uses this key to write telemetry data to New Relic. [You can find your New Relic license key in your account settings](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/).
</Step>
<Step>

Navigate to the root directory of your application and execute the _env.sh_ script to export these variables:

```bash
./env.sh
```

This scripts takes all the variables you declared in _.env_ file and set them so you don't have to manually set all the environment variables to run your application. 
</Step>
<Step>
Build and run the application:

```bash animate
docker compose build
docker compose up

```
Once your application is up and running, you'll see loader generating the traffic:

![loader traffic](../../../images/error-inbox/loader-traffic.png)

Leave the application running so you could see the telemetry data in New Relic.
