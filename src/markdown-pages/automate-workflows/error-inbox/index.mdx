<Intro>

You're a developer of an eCommerce website called Geek's movie shop. You made some recent changes in your site's architecture and introduced some new features. The changes are ready to go live. However, you know that it's hard to identify the blast radius of errors once the application is in production. Since the changes are going to impact thousands of your customers, you want to find out if these changes will have any negative effect on them before pushing it to production. 
To ensure a smooth experience for your customers, you can use Error Inbox to track errors across you stack and take action on them before they impact your customers.
