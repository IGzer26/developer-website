      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Fetch data from a third-party service, before starting this one. In this course, you're building a New Relic One application. This application shows telemetry data from a demo service that is running an A/B test so that it can reveal that data in charts, like a dashboard. Your New Relic application is different than a dashboard, however, because it does more than show New Relic data. It pulls external data, provides UI components and functionality, and even has its own small data stores. The purpose of this New Relic application is to present context so you can better understand the A/B test results and how those results tie in to your business objectives. So far, you've built all your charts, organized them for improved usability, provided them with real data, and more. There are some final improvements you can make, using Platform API components. In this lesson, you learn how to use values in the New Relic platform state. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-platform-state-context/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, add a PlatformStateContext.Consumer to your NewsletterSignups component's render() method: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Notice that NrqlQuery uses a constant called ACCOUNT_ID. Instead of hardcoding an account identifier in your Nerdlet, you can use accountId from the platform URL state. Step 3 of 10 PlatformStateContext.Consumer provides access to the platform's URL state. This context contains an important value you'll use in your app, called timeRange. Notice that your NrqlQuery uses a SINCE clause that identifies the historical timeframe your query should fetch data from. Right now, that SINCE clause is set to 30 MINUTES AGO. With timeRange, you can use the platform's time picker to make this timeframe adjustable. Step 4 of 10 Utilize the platform state's timeRange: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, NewsletterSignups uses platformState.timeRange instead of a hardcoded SINCE clause. While NrqlQuery components accept a convenient timeRange prop, not every component does. You can still use timeRange in other contexts by accessing duration, begin_time, or end_time: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { console.log(platformState.timeRange.duration); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>; Copy Step 5 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test. Step 6 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 7 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 10 View your application: Your NrqlQuery now uses the platform state's timeRange, but your chart probably still shows the last 30 minutes. Why? Where does the timeRange in platform state come from? The time picker sits on the right side of your application's navigation bar: Change this value and see your chart update: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 9 of 10 Update VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Of all the charts in your New Relic One application, these three charts are the ones that should update with the time picker. The others, Total subscriptions per version, Total cancellations per version, Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions, Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, show total values over time. So, hardcoding their SINCE clauses to 7 DAYS AGO makes sense, as this is a reasonable time period for the purposes of this course. Step 10 of 10 While still serving your Nerdpack locally, view your NR1 app to see your charts updating with the time range you choose: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now that you're basing your queries off the platform state, some of your charts are dynamic in their time ranges. This is a great improvement because it allows you to adjust your charts to show data from any particular point in time, which is useful for tying data to business outcomes. The Platform API components offer a lot more functionality, too, including the ability to navigate the user to another place in New Relic. You'll learn how to do this in the next lesson.

      "info": "Intro to New Relic One SDK",
      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: allows you to configure your Nerdlet and write to your Nerdlet's URL state.",

      "body": "Access the New Relic platform from the comfort of your terminal. You can use the New Relic CLI to manage entity tags, define workloads, record deployment markers, and much more. In short, you can use the CLI to automate common tasks in your DevOps workflow. This guide walks you through the essentials of New Relic CLI, from install and configuration to basic usage. Before you begin For this guide you just need: Your New Relic user key. An instrumented application in your New Relic account. Step 1 of 10 Install the New Relic CLI Download the New Relic CLI for your operating system, as described below. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Using Snapcraft, run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Using Homebrew, run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Using Scoop, run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 10 Create your New Relic CLI profile. After you install the New Relic CLI, it's time to create your first profile. Profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command, which is useful when switching between accounts. Run the profiles add command: bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add --profile tutorial --apiKey YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY -r YOUR_REGION $ # Set the profile as defaults $ newrelic profiles default --profile tutorial Important You must set the region of your New Relic account. Use -r to set either us or eu. Step 3 of 10 Get your application details. Now, add tags to the application you've instrumented with New Relic. Tags are key-value pairs that can help you organize and filter your entities. An entity (for example, an application) can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. Before searching for your application using the New Relic CLI, write down or copy your Account ID and the name of your application in New Relic - you need both to find applications in the New Relic platform. Step 4 of 10 Retrieve your application details as a JSON object. To search for your APM application, use the apm application search command: bash Copy $ newrelic apm application search --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID --name NAME_OF_YOUR_APP Tip If you get an error, check that your account ID and application name are correct. Step 5 of 10 Find the guid value. If the account ID is valid, and the application name exists in your account, apm application search yields data similar to this example: [ { \"accountId\": YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, \"applicationId\": YOUR_APP_ID, \"domain\": \"APM\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"A_LONG_GUID\", \"name\": \"NAME_OF_YOUR_APP\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/A_LONG_GUID\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" } ] Copy When you've successfully searched for your application, look for the guid value. It's a unique identifier for your application. You should copy it or write it down. Step 6 of 10 Add a simple tag to your application. Now that you have the GUID, you can point the New Relic CLI directly at your application. Adding a tag is the simplest way to try out the CLI capabilities (don't worry, tags can be deleted by using entity tags delete). Here, you add an environment tag to your application. Add the dev:testing tag⁠ (or any other key-value pair) to your application using the entities tags create command: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag devkit:testing Step 7 of 10 Add tag sets. What if you want to add multiple tags? Tag sets to the rescue! While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 To add multiple tags to your application at once, modify and run this snippet: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: this means it could take a while for the tags to get created. Step 8 of 10 Retrieve your application's tags. You've created and added some tags to your application, but to test that they're working, you need to retrieve them. Run the entity tags get command: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags get --guid YOUR_APP_GUID All tags associated with your application are retrieved as a JSON array: [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Step 9 of 10 Bonus step: create a deployment marker. Deployments of applications often go wrong. Deployment markers are labels that, when attached to your application data, help you track deployments and troubleshoot what happened. To create a deployment marker, run the apm deployment create command using the same application ID from your earlier search: bash Copy $ newrelic apm deployment create --applicationId YOUR_APP_ID --revision $(git describe --tags --always) Step 10 of 10 Check the JSON response for the revision and timestamp of the deployment. You can build this workflow into a continuous integration or continuous deployment (CI/CD) system to indicate changes in your application's behavior after deployments. Here's an example: { \"id\": 37075986, \"links\": { \"application\": 204261368 }, \"revision\": \"v1.2.4\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-03-04T15:11:44-08:00\", \"user\": \"Developer Toolkit Test Account\" } Copy Next steps Have a look at all the available commands in the New Relic CLI. For example, you can create a New Relic workflow using workload create If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

Once your metrics are in New Relic, you can query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Want to try out our StatsD integration? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements This integration uses our Metric API and our Event API to ingest data. To use these APIs, you'll need a license key. The integration adheres to the Metric API requirements and data limits. The default rate limit is 100,000 data points per minute (DPM). If you think you're missing metrics or sending more than 100K DPM, see Request data changes. To see if your account is hitting the rate limit, run the following NRQL query of the NrIntegrationError event: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' FACET category, message LIMIT 100 since 1 day ago Copy Install This section will explain how to do a standard install. If you want to run StatsD in Kubernetes, see Kubernetes install. To install the StatsD integration, run the following command and include your New Relic account ID and New Relic license key. This generates a TOML configuration file used by gostatsd. docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy If your account is in the EU data center region, add this to the above command: -e NR_EU_REGION=true \\ Copy After installing, you can: Do optional additional configuration Define your metrics Add custom tags to your data Create alerts Install for Kubernetes Here are examples of Kubernetes manifests for deployment and service objects: Kubernetes manifest examples Below are examples of Kubernetes manifests to deploy StatsD in a Kubernetes environment and create a StatsD service named newrelic-statsd.

Configure In the install procedure, you run nri-statsd with environment variables, and this generates a TOML configuration file. Additionally, you can set these configuration options: Configuration options Description expiry-interval string If a metric is not updated for this amount of time, we stop reporting that metric. Default is 5m. If you want to send the metrics only if the value was updated between the flush intervals, configure this to 1ms. To never expire metrics, set it to 0. percent-threshold list of integers Specifies the percentiles used for metrics aggregation. Default: 90. metrics-addr string Indicates address on which to listen for metrics. Default: :8125. Tip To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the StatsD integration you must define the following endpoints in the custom configuration: address = 'https://gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/ $NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' Copy address-metrics = 'https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' Copy Here are some examples of customizing configuration by overwriting the default configuration: Example of custom configuration # Specify after how long do we expire metrics, default:5m expiry-interval = '1ms' # percent-threshold specify a list of percentiles for metrics aggregation, default:90 percent-threshold = [90, 99] backends='newrelic' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY' Copy Disable timer sub-metrics: By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. If you want to disable those metrics you can do it by adding a disabled-sub-metrics configuration section and set true for the ones you want disabled. Here's an example: # disabled-sub-metrics configuration section allows disabling timer sub-metrics [disabled-sub-metrics] # Regular metrics count=false count-per-second=false mean=false median=false lower=false upper=false stddev=false sum=false sum-squares=false # Percentile metrics count-pct=false mean-pct=false sum-pct=false sum-squares-pct=false lower-pct=false upper-pct=false Copy Docker: overwrite default configuration To overwrite the default nri-statsd configuration while running in a container, you can mount a configuration file inside the container. You can adopt the following template as needed for your situation. Example: backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY' Copy To run the container with the file mounted in the appropriate path: docker run \\ ... -v ${PWD}/nri-statsd.toml:/etc/opt/newrelic/nri-statsd.toml \\ ... newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Kubernetes: overwrite default configuration The best approach to configure nri-statsd running in Kubernetes is to use a configMap and mount the configMap into the container. (This is a similar process to mounting the configuration file in Docker.) Example: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-statsd-config namespace: default data: nri-statsd.toml: | backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = '$NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY' Copy To use the configMap, declare a volume on your deployment spec template and then declare a volumeMount on your container spec. Example: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment spec: template: spec: containers: .... volumeMounts: - mountPath: /etc/opt/newrelic/ name: nri-statsd-config volumes: - name: nri-statsd-config configMap: name: nri-statsd-config Copy Metric format The integration receives metrics using the StatsD protocol. Optionally, the sample rate can be configured and tags can be added. Here's the metric data format we use: <metric name>:<value>|<type>|@<sample rate>|#<tags> Copy Here are explanations of these fields: Field name Description < metric name> string Required. Name of the metric. < value> string Required. The metric type: c = counter g = gauge ms = timer @ < sample rate> float Optional for simple counters or timer counters. When many metrics must be sent, you can use sampling to reduce network traffic. The downside is a reduction in the resolution of the data. An example of how this would work for sample rates below 1: If you set this to 0.1, the counter would send a measurement one out of every 10 times. # < tags> string Optional. Tags attached to your metrics are converted into attributes (key-value pairs). For more on tagging options, see Tags. Metric types Here are the types of metrics and how to format them: Counter A counter measures the number of occurrences of an event. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. A counter can be incremented or decremented during the same flush interval by adding a sign to the value. In the following example, the counter value will be 2: counter:4|c counter:-2|c Copy At each flush, the current count is sent and reset to 0. If the count is not updated, at the next flush it will send the value 0. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Here’s an example of a counter that is being sampled 1 out of 10 times: counter:4|c@0.1 Copy Gauge A gauge represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include temperature, CPU usage, and memory. Here's an example: temperature:40|g Copy If the gauge is not updated, at the next flush it will send the previous value. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Timer The timer metric type measures timing data. By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. These are sent as sub-metrics in the following format: <metric_base_name>.std_dev <metric_base_name>.median <metric_base_name>.summary <metric_base_name>.sum_squares <metric_base_name>.mean <metric_base_name>.per_second Copy The configured percentiles will generate the following metrics. The percentile threshold value will be attached as a tag. <metric_base_name>.sum_squares.percentiles <metric_base_name>.sum.percentiles <metric_base_name>.count.percentiles <metric_base_name>.upper.percentiles <metric_base_name>.mean.percentiles Copy The percentile threshold can be tweaked with the percent-threshold config option. These can be controlled through the disabled-sub-metrics configuration section. Add tags (attributes) You can add tags to your data, which we save as attributes (key-value pairs). There are two options for adding tags: Add default tags that apply to all metrics: These apply to all metrics. They are fixed and don't change over time. Add metric-level tags: These apply to specific metrics and allow the value to be changed between two submits. Add default tags that apply to all metrics Add tags to metrics and events by defining an environment variable in the startup command. Here's an example that would create two tags: -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" Copy Here's that environment variable used in the startup command: docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Add metric-level tags When defining the metric format, you can add tags using this format: <bucket name>:<value>|<type>|#<tags> Copy In this example, <tags> is a comma-separated list of tags. Tags format is: simple or key:value. Here's an example NRQL query that includes a custom tag: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE environment = 'production' Copy Create alerts You can alert on StatsD data using NRQL alert conditions. Alert example This procedure walks you through sending some sample data and then creating an alert condition using that data. First, send this data to New Relic’s StatsD container: echo \"prod.test.num:32|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Next, create a NRQL alert condition using this query: SELECT latest(prod.test.num) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'prod.test.num' Copy Here's an image showing creating this NRQL alert condition. Notice that the sample data sent in is represented by the blue dot on the upper right of the chart. Now we can create the alert condition with these settings: When you create the NRQL alert condition, be sure to set the Condition name. If a metric with a value above 50 is sent, then an incident is created and notified. The incident is closed automatically after 24 hours. To test that the alert is working, run this command: echo \"prod.test.num:60|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Find and use data To query your data, you'd use any New Relic query option. For example, you might run a NRQL query like: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'myMetric' and environment = 'production' Copy For more on how to query the Metric data type, see Query metric data.

For more in-depth information, see New Relic One pricing. Q: Is there a limit on the number of concurrent sessions or IP addresses that may be used with a user account? A: Yes. See Manage users. Q: What terms govern my use of the Products? A: If a Customer has paid New Relic during a rolling 12-month period, then Customer’s usage of the Products is covered by the Paid Terms of Service. If a Customer has not paid New Relic during a 12-month period, then Customer’s usage of the Products is covered by the Unpaid Terms of Service. Q: How are the number of full users (also referred to as Monthly Provisioned Users) calculated for each month? A: Please see Calculation details. Q: Can I mix and match New Relic One Standard, Pro, and Enterprise users in a billing account? A: No. For the New Relic One pricing plan, you can only have one subscription per organization (group of accounts that share the same billing ID). Q: Can Event extended retention, additional Synthetics Checks, or additional New Relic Edge data be added to my account? A: For additional retention for Events or Logs beyond the Standard Data Retention, contact your New Relic account executive. Note: Minimum requirement for Extended Retention requires an Annual Pool of Funds subscription. Q: What is included in New Relic's Free Tier of Products? A: Please see this pricing doc for a description of what's included. Customer’s use of the Free Tier shall be governed by the terms and conditions described in the Unpaid Terms of Service.

Q: How does the ‘Free Tier’ impact my pay-as-you-go (PAYG) or Annual Pool of Funds (APOF) subscription? A: The Free Tier usage will be deducted automatically from the Monthly Product Usage for Pay-as-you-go or Annual pool of funds subscriptions.",

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default mobile monitoring events using the mobile agent SDKs. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the crash event trail UI. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams.

Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description Mobile A Mobile event is created when a crash occurs, when an interaction ends or has run for 1 second, or if a session completes after the app is closed, backgrounded, or has run for 10 minutes. Mobile events were once the only event type and were generated for every event, but now there are several specialized event types. MobileBreadcrumb There are no attributes listed for this event because it's a custom event; attributes will include the session attributes and any custom attributes added. MobileCrash The MobileCrash event is created when an app crashes. MobileCrash includes attributes such as crash line number, class, and crash message. MobileHandledException MobileHandledException is sent when an exception is caught and is used for non-fatal exceptions reported to New Relic using the recordHandledException API call for Android or iOS. The exceptions will be visible in queries of this event and on the Handled exceptions UI page, including stack traces. MobileRequest A MobileRequest event is created when an HTTP request successfully completes, resulting in a response code below 400. New Relic MobileRequest data is enabled by default for: Android version 5.15.2 or higher iOS version 6.0.0 or higher For earlier versions, starting with Android version 5.14.0 or iOS version 5.14.0, you must enable the feature. Upgrade to the latest Android or iOS version, or enable the NetworkRequests feature flag by using the Android or iOS configuration settings. MobileRequestError A MobileRequestError is used for HTTP errors or network failures. HTTP errors are HTTP requests that have a status code greater than 400. A network failure is an HTTP request that results in no response. The event is sent when the HTTP request completes. MobileSession A MobileSession event is sent when an app is closed, backgrounded, or when 10 minutes of active use has elapsed. This is the source of the general session data used by the other mobile monitoring events. MobileSession captures attributes such as device type, device OS, and geographical information. Custom events There is no attribute list for this event type because it is a custom event; attributes will include the session attributes and any custom attributes that you add.

Requirements For event and attribute formatting requirements and best practices, see Limits and requirements. Avoid rate limits Reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance. It may also result in approaching or passing data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Example use cases Two popular custom data solutions are custom events and custom attributes. There are several ways to accomplish this (more on that later in this doc), depending on your New Relic implementation and tools. Here are some common use cases for implementing custom events and attributes. Using custom attributes Custom attributes are often used to add important business and operational context to existing events. Business context might include: Customer token Customer market segment Customer value classification Workflow control values not obvious in the URIStem User/product/account privilege context Operational context might include: Which feature flags were used What datastore was accessed What cache was accessed What errors were detected and ignored (fault partitioning) Using custom events Event data is one of New Relic's four core data types. We recommend reading that definition to understand what we mean by \"event\" and why that data type is most used for reporting specific types of activity. The use cases for custom events varies widely: basically they are used for any type of activity that an organization deems important and that is not already being monitored. A couple examples: An event might represent an activity involving multiple actions, like a customer purchasing a certain combination of products. An event might record backup activity. For example, they might set up reporting of events that represent production backups of their SOLR instances into an event table, with a timestamp of when it occurred, which cluster, and the duration. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser monitoring agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure monitoring agent Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile monitoring agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetic monitoring Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools. For ways to report other types of custom data, see: Metric API Logs Trace API Extend data retention To learn how to extend how long events are retained in your account, see our documentation about event data retention.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. Terragrunt is a thin wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state. In this guide, you will use Terragrunt to generate your Terraform configurations, create files with Terragrunt, and reuse the Terragrunt configuration to manage multiple environments. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic Infrastructure agent for your host. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: You will also need to install Terragrunt to follow this guide: bash Copy $ brew install terragrunt To follow the examples in this guide, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 6 Create a new configuration Terragrunt is a wrapper that provides extra tooling for your Terraform configurations. In the next steps, you will create a new configuration using Terragrunt, Terraform, and New Relic. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terragrunt-config && cd terragrunt-config In the new directory, create a terragrunt.hcl file, create a ./src directory, and create a ./environments directory: bash Copy $ touch terragrunt.hcl $ mkdir src $ mkdir environments Inside of your environments folder, create a folder named dev. In the ./src directory, create a main.tf and provider.tf files: bash Copy $ mkdir environments/dev $ touch src/main.tf $ touch src/provider.tf In the provider.tf file add the appropriate Terraform and New Relic provider configuration information: terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } Copy In the main.tf add a New Relic alert policy named DemoPolicy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Copy In the ./environments/dev directory create a new file named terragrunt.hcl bash Copy $ cd ./environments/dev/ $ touch terragrunt.hcl Within the dev folder update the terragrunt.hcl file by adding the following include statement. The include statement tells Terragrunt to use any .hcl confgiuration files it finds in parent folders. include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } Copy Next, add a Terraform block to provide Terragrunt with a Terraform source reference. terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Now you need to configure the provider with your New Relic account details. You will need your New Relic user API key and account ID. provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you have a single account: The account ID is displayed on the API keys page. If your organization has multiple accounts: From one.newrelic.com, select Entity explorer and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page. Tip Documentation about the New Relic provider is provided on the Terraform doc site. Update the provider.tf file to define the New Relic account variables that will help keep the Terraform configuration dynamic. variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy In your terminal, change directories to the environments/dev folder and run the command terragrunt init: bash Copy $ terragrunt init Terraform init sets up a bit of context, sets up environment variables, and then runs terraform init. You will see the following output: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. [terragrunt] [/Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev] 2021/02/02 13:30:31 Copying lock file [output] from /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev/.terragrunt-cache/e-PoBgWhdv3v8QGOtDQxS_WeYu4/ 69zjIFUfApJiUt8gFmi-6-dcPe8/.terraform.lock.hcl to /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy $ terragrunt plan Terragrunt starts to run but pauses to ask for the inputs to the New Relic account variables added to the provider.tf file. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2/02 13:32:08 Running command: terraform plan var.newrelic_account_id Enter a value: Interrupt received. Exit the terragrunt plan process with CTRL+C . In the environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl file, add an inputs block to provide the values for your New Relic account variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy The updated terragrunt.hcl only has the include, terraform, and inputs block include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Now, when you run terragrunt plan, Terragrunt will provide the input block's values, no longer prompting the command line for values. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Run terragrunt apply. After Terraform finishes process, check your New Relic account for the new Demo Policy. Step 2 of 6 Adding to your configuration Now that you have a basic New Relic configuration created, add configurations built in the Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides in this step. Tip If you haven't done the previous developer guides, you can copy the configurations for this section from the Terragrunt Intro Github Repo. Update the main.tf to include the additional terraform configurations. Update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy You have added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. To clone the module from GitHub, run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply. After Terraform is done processing, You will see your Demo Policy now has two conditions in your New Relic account and one alert channel attached. Step 3 of 6 Using your Environment as a Terragrunt Variable Using Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you are running to the name of the data you are creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create a new input for env_name inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy in the main.tf file add a new variable for 'env_name' variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Using string interpolation, add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks. resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to the configuration name. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Currently, the environment variable name is hardcoded into the root terragrunt.hcl file. You want to avoid having your variables hardcoded, using a terragrunt built-in function will pass the value. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use the path_relative_to_include() built-in function and pass the value has the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output, the env_name variable will have the entire ./environments/dev/ path. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Next, update the terragrunt.hcl to only include 'dev' as the env_name variable. Adding a locals block creates a local variable, using the replace built-in function will remove the unwanted parts of the relative path, and update the inputs block to use the local variable. locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output the env_name variable will now have 'dev:' added. Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Step 4 of 6 Storing the State Remotely At the moment, the state file is local. The next steps will update your Terraform configurations to remove the local state file and use a file stored remotely in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, various state files will need to be store in separate S3 buckets, not to override each other. Terragrunt allows you to generate files on the fly. Adding the remote_state block into the root level terragrunt.hcl file, you will generate a new file named backend.tf. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"my-terraform-state\" key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true } } Copy After adding the remote_state block, you will need to give the configuration for the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state. Tip To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Now, update the remote_state block to provide your S3 bucket and update the key to use the local environment variable created previously. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Next, run terragrunt plan. If you look in the Amazon S3 bucket, you will see a folder named envs. Within the envs folder is a directory called devs containing terraform.tfstate file. Tip To see the files created by Terragrunt, look inside of the ./environments/dev directory. There is a hidden directory named terragrunt-cache. Within the terragrunt-cache directory, you will see the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Step 5 of 6 Creating a New Environment Now that you have a working configuration for your dev environment, you will create a new environment reusing the dev configurations in the next steps. In the environments directory, create a new folder names nonprod. In the nonprod folder, create a new terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl In the nonprod terragrunt.hcl file copy over the configuration from the environment terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you are using a different account for your nonprod environment, you can update the inputs with a new New Relic account ID and API key. Inside of your nonprod directory, run terragrunt init then run terragrunt apply. In the output, you will see Terraform has created a new set of resources. The new resources should have the nonprod name prefixed. Step 6 of 6 Terragrunt has created two environments, but there is no difference between them other than the name. Adding variables in the configurations allows your configurations to be more dynamic. In the next steps, you will add variables to your configurations. In the main.tf add new variables for the Host Conditions modules cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage values: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy In the main.tf update the HostConditions module values to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Run terragrunt plan. In the output, the HostConditions values have changed to use the variable defaults. Next, you want to pass the values into your environment configurations by adding the inputs block variables. In the nonprod/terragrunt.hcl file, add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy Run terragrunt apply. In your New Relic account, you will see a new policy with configurations changed based on the environment. Conclusion Congratulations! You've used Terragrunt to generate your New Relic configurations and manage multiple environments. Review the Terragrunt Intro Example, New Relic Terraform provider documentation, and Terragrunt quick start to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "You can manage your alert notification channels using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. Get notification channels The notificationChannels query allows you to paginate through all of your notification channels per account. You can also use the notificationChannel query to get a specific notification channel by its ID. Tip Note that certain secret fields (for example passwords or API keys) are obfuscated in the returned fields. List all notification channels for an account This example returns every field for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, up to the page limit of 200. Note how we use inline fragments to refer to the specific fields on the concrete types implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { config { integrationUrl } } ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { config { baseUrl basicAuth { password username } customHttpHeaders { name value } customPayloadBody customPayloadType } } ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { config { key routeKey } } ... on AlertsUserNotificationChannel { config { userId } } ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { config { apiKey } } ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { config { apiKey dataCenterRegion recipients tags teams } } ... on AlertsHipChatNotificationChannel { config { authToken baseUrl roomId } } ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { config { emails includeJson } } ... on AlertsCampfireNotificationChannel { config { room subdomain token } } } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Paginate through notification channels with cursor pagination If a given account's list of notification channels exceeds the 200 channel page limit, you can use the pagination cursor to retrieve additional pages. With cursor pagination, you continue to request additional pages using the nextCursor until that field returns empty in the response. An empty nextCursor signals that you have reached the end of the result set. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"notificationChannels\": { \"channels\": [ { \"id\": \"250\", \"name\": \"Channel 1\", \"type\": \"SLACK\" }, { \"id\": \"713\", \"name\": \"Channel 2\", \"type\": \"WEBHOOK\" }, // ... +198 more notification channels in reality ], \"nextCursor\": \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\", \"totalCount\": 268 } } } } } } Copy In your next request, provide the cursor like so, updating each subsequent request to return the updated cursor, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels(cursor: \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\") { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Find a specific notification channel by id If you have a specific notification channel's ID, the API allows you to look it up directly. Note that because the specific channel is a concrete type implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface, you may need to specify certain fields using the ... on syntax for inline fragments. In this example, we are retrieving a Slack channel: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannel(id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id name type ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } } } } } } Copy List notification channels with their associated policies This example returns the ID, name, and type for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, as well as a list of every policy that is associated with that channel. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type associatedPolicies { policies { id name } totalCount } } nextCursor totalCount } } } } } Copy Create a notification channel In order to create an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to create (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Once a notification channel has been created, it can be associated with one or more alert policies. Once associated, those channels will receive notifications from those policies when conditions are violated. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only create a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Create an email notification channel An example create mutation for an email notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { emails: [\"email@example.com\"], includeJson: true, name: \"Some Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type config { emails includeJson } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an OpsGenie notification channel An example create mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { apiKey: \"api-key-from-opsgenie\", dataCenterRegion: US, name: \"OpsGenie notification channel name\", recipients: [\"user@example.com\"], tags: [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"], teams: [\"team1\", \"team2\"] } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey teams tags recipients dataCenterRegion } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a PagerDuty notification channel An example create mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty notification channel name\", apiKey: \"api-key-from-pagerduty\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Slack notification channel An example create mutation for a Slack notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack notification channel name\", teamChannel: \"#team-channel\", url: \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/FAKE/MOREFAKE/IMAGINARYEXAMPLEURLCHUNK\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type config { teamChannel url } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a VictorOps notification channel An example create mutation for a VictorOps notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { key: \"example-api-key-from-victorops\", name: \"VictorOps notification channel name\", routeKey: \"example-route-key\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type config { key routeKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Webhook notification channel An example create mutation for a Webhook notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { baseUrl: \"https://example.com/webhook\", basicAuth: { password: \"t0t4lly-s3cr3t-p455w0rd\", username: \"webhook-user\" }, customHttpHeaders: [ {name: \"X-Api-Key\", value: \"100%-real-api-key\"}, {name:

{ password username } baseUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an xMatters notification channel An example create mutation for an xMatters notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { integrationUrl: \"https://company.instance.xmatters.com/api/xm/v<version>/...\", name: \"xMatters notification channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type config { integrationUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Update a notification channel In order to update an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to change (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Consistent with other GraphQL APIs, you can update a single field on the channel without knowing anything other than the channel's ID. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only update a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Update an email notification channel An example update mutation for an email notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { name: \"Updated Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an OpsGenie notification channel An example update mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { name: \"OpsGenie updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a PagerDuty notification channel An example update mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Slack notification channel An example update mutation for a Slack notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a VictorOps notification channel An example update mutation for a VictorOps notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { name: \"VictorOps updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Webhook notification channel An example update mutation for a Webhook notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { name: \"Webhook updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an xMatters notification channel An example update mutation for an xMatters notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { name: \"xMatters updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Delete a notification channel You can delete a notification channel with only the account ID and the channel ID. Note that deleting a channel dissociates it from all policies, meaning that no further notifications will be sent to that channel. mutation { alertsNotificationChannelDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Associate channels to a policy Creating an alert notification channel is not enough: Once the channel has been created, it needs to be associated to one or more policies. Once associated to a policy, the channel can recieve alert notifications when conditions on that policy go into violation. In this example, we associate two channels with a policy: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsAddToPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Dissociate a channel from a policy In those instances where a notification channel has outlived its usefulness (for example, an email list that has been retired), the time has come to dissociate that channel from the policy (or policies) that are sending alert notifications to it. This API call leaves the channel itself intact, but removes it from the specified policy. In this example, we are removing two channels from a policy (leaving any others in place), and getting back confirmation that those two channel IDs have been removed: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsRemoveFromPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Tip Removing an alert notification channel from a policy does not delete the channel because it might be used by other policies. On the other hand, deleting a channel will cause all associated policies to stop sending alert notifications to that channel.",

      "body": "Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Install Snapcraft, and then run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Install Homebrew, and then run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Install Scoop, and then run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Copy or write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity Using your entity guid, you can add tags right away. Invoke the entities tags create command. If you want to add multiple tags, use tag sets: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "CodeStream and New Relic work together in several ways to give you insight into your code's errors, as well as making it easier to get started instrumenting your code with our APM agents. Specifically, when CodeStream is connected to New Relic, you can to jump from a stack trace error in the New Relic UI directly to the offending line of code in your IDE. Once in your IDE, you can use all of CodeStream's collaboration tools to discuss the code, request feedback, and submit a pull request to resolve the issue and push up the fix to your repository. Preview release CodeStream's integration with New Relic One is a preview release limited to New Relic One accounts on our US data center, and your use is subject to the pre-release policy. (This does not apply to all other CodeStream functionality.) Connect CodeStream and New Relic Before you can take advantage of New Relic's observability features in CodeStream, you'll need to connect them. Requirements for connecting CodeStream and New Relic: New Relic account (If you don't have a New Relic account, sign up at newrelic.com/signup. It's free, forever!) New Relic user key If you don't have a user key or want to learn more about how you can use and manage them, see our doc on the New Relic user key. Once you have your New Relic user key, in CodeStream's Observability section click Connect to New Relic One, then paste your API key and click Connect. Caution New Relic users can share stacktrace errors on CodeStream. Once you've connected CodeStream to New Relic, any new users you add to your CodeStream organization can see those errors. See your errors and what's causing them After you connect CodeStream and New Relic, use workloads and errors inbox to jump to the offending code in your IDE. Requirements for opening stack trace errors in your IDE: New Relic account (If you don't have a New Relic account, sign up at newrelic.com/signup. It's free, forever!) New Relic user key CodeStream and New Relic connection Data being reported to New Relic via APM monitoring A workload for errors inbox An error For APM errors, your repository's commit hash and release tag New Relic errors inbox is a single place to proactively detect, prioritize, and take action on your errors before they impact customers. With CodeStream, you can jump from an error directly to the offending code in your IDE. Tip Limited to APM errors. How to go from errors inbox to your IDE From one.newrelic.com/, go to Errors Inbox, click a stack trace error, then click Open in IDE. APM errors and CodeStream To use CodeStream's Open in IDE with your APM stack trace errors, use environment variables to configure your APM agent with your application's commit sha and/or your release tag associated with the running version of your software. CodeStream only needs the first seven characters of your commit sha (for example, 734713b) to make this connection, but you can include the entire sha. Alternately, you can use a release tag (such as v0.1.209 or release-209) for CodeStream to find the correct version of your code. For New Relic APM, the commit and/or release tag (tags.commit and tags.releaseTag) are added as attributes on Transaction and TransactionError events. You can use APM environment variables to set these attributes. We recommend setting one or both of these variables as part of your build pipeline. NEW_RELIC_METADATA_COMMIT - The commit sha. You can include the whole thing or only the first seven characters. NEW_RELIC_METADATA_RELEASE_TAG - A release tag (such as v0.1.209 or release-209). This has the advantage of being human readable. For more on how to set these variables, here are specific configuration details for each language: Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Give us your repository's URL Once you've started monitoring for APM, mobile, browser, or Lambda, you can connect those things with your repository. In order to link your data in New Relic to your code, we need to know the URL for your repository. For example, the URL can be in either the SSH or HTTPS format: git@github.com:newrelic/beta-docs-site.git https://github.com/newrelic/beta-docs-site.git Caution It's possible to add the same GitHub repository more than once, if you're using different protocols to do so. The UI warns you about this, but won't prevent you from doing so. For example, https://github.com/tuna/repo and git@github.com:tuna/repo are the same repo, with different protocols. You can use any one of these methods to set up your repository: Use environment variable with APM (recommended) Set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_METADATA_REPOSITORY_URL. New Relic APM agents create the repository entity and associate it to your application entity automatically. This requires the SSH or HTTPS URL format. We recommend that these be set as part of your build pipeline. Use the UI Once you've started sending data to New Relic, use the UI to connect your related repository. For APM, mobile, browser, and Lambda monitoring, find the Connect repository button on the right-hand side. To connect your repository, click Connnect repository, then find an existing repository or add a new one. Use the NerdGraph API Use New Relic's NerdGraph APIsto create a repository and associate it with your application entities. Step 1: Create a repository entity To create a repository entity, use the referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository API and make sure to save the GUID that's produced. The API takes the following parameters: accountId - the integer account ID for the account you want to add the repository to url - example https://github.com/newrelic/beta-docs-site.git name - example: newrelic/beta-docs-site mutation { referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository(repositories: [{accountId: [YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID], name: \"[REPO_NAME]\", url: \"[REPO_URL]\"}]) { created failures { guid message type } } } Copy In order to find the entity you create, you can use a query like the following. Note that the URL you provided to referenceEntityCreateOrUpdateRepository gets saved as an entity tag. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name = 'a name' OR tags.url = 'a url'\") { count query results { entities { guid name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Step 2: Associate the repository entity to your application entity First, find the GUID for the application you want to associate your repository to. Parameters: sourceEntityGuid - the entity GUID of the application targetEntityGuid - the entity GUID of your repository type - always BUILT_FROM mutation { entityRelationshipUserDefinedCreateOrReplace(sourceEntityGuid: \"\", targetEntityGuid: \"\", type: BUILT_FROM) { errors { message type } } } Copy To see all entities related to your repository you can do a query like this: { actor { entity(guid: \"[YOUR_REPOSITORY_GUID]]\") { relatedEntities(filter: {direction: BOTH, relationshipTypes: {include: BUILT_FROM}}) { results { target { entity { name guid type } } type } } name type tags { values key } } } } Copy Step 3: Cleanup (if needed) Delete a repository with the following query: mutation DeleteRepository { entityDelete(guids: \"[ENTITY_GUID_HERE]]\") { deletedEntities failures { message guid } } } Copy Install APM agents with CodeStream Requirements for installing New Relic APM agents via CodeStream: New Relic account New Relic user key CodeStream and New Relic connection A supported language application codebase .NET Core Java Node.JS When you first connect CodeStream to New Relic, if you're working on an application's codebase that's not being monitored by New Relic, CodeStream will offer to instrument that application for you. Like New Relic's guided install, CodeStream will walk you through and automate all of the steps to installing the APM agent to start sending data to New Relic. This check only happens automatically when the initial connection is made. To do so later, in the CodeStream extension, click your username, then click New Relic Setup. Dynamic logging with Go and Pixie New Relic account New Relic user API key CodeStream and New Relic connection A Kubernetes cluster monitored by Pixie An application written in Go You can use CodeStream to enable dynamic logging for your Pixie-monitored Go applications. For relevant projects, you can use CodeStream to dynamically log your Go method names in your IDE.",

      "body": "You can use our NerdGraph API to add tags to your data to help improve data organization and findability. Overview This doc explains how to use our NerdGraph API to add and manage tags. Note that this is only one way to add tags. For other methods, see How tags are added. For how to automate tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Read tags for an entity To construct these queries and see responses: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to find the entity and then fetch its tags. Use NerdGraph's tag API to read the existing tags and their values. In this example, our entity is a browser app called Cookie Checkout: { actor { entitySearch (query: \"name like 'Cookie Checkout'\") { results { entities { tags { key values } } } } } } Copy The actual values vary depending on your data. Use the New Relic GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Add tags for an entity To add new tags for an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity you want to tag. Use the taggingAddTagsToEntity mutation to add a tag with a value to the entity. For APM agents, a restart is required after adding a new tag. In this example, we have a browser application called Cookie Checkout owned by a UI team. We want to add a team tag with a ui value to this instance. Once the tag is added, we can filter by the tag team:ui and find the Cookie Checkout app in the New Relic One UI. mutation { taggingAddTagsToEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: { key: \"team\", values: [\"ui\"]}) { errors { message } } } Copy Remove a tag from an entity To delete a tag and all of its associated values from an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagFromEntity mutation. For APM agents, a restart is required after changing tags. The following example mutation removes the team tag from an entity: mutation { taggingDeleteTagFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagKeys: [\"team\"]) { errors { message } } } Copy Delete specific tag values for an entity Instead of deleting an entire tag and all of its values, you can delete a single tag value. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation deletes the ui value from the tag key: mutation { taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagValues : [{key: \"team\" value: \"ui\"}]) { errors { message } } } Copy Because tagValues is an array, you can delete multiple specific values from a single entity in one mutation. Replace all tag values for an entity To replace the entity’s entire set of tags with the provided tag set: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity mutation. In this example, the Cookie Checkout browser application was transferred from the ui team to the cookie-dev team. You can replace the tag values for team with the following mutation: mutation { taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: {key: \"team\" values: [\"cookie-dev\"]}) { errors { message } } } Copy",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "What is a codemark? Quite simply, a codemark is a discussion connected to the code. It could be a question, a suggestion, a bug report, or documentation. All of these discussions are saved, anchored to the blocks of code they refer to, so that they can be leveraged in the future. It could be a new developer joining the team, a developer trying to fix a bug in someone else’s code, or even just you trying to remember why you made that change six months ago… whatever the case, CodeStream helps you understand the code by surfacing the discussions in a contextual way. Even as a file changes over time, the codemarks will remain connected to the code. Add some new lines of code above the code block, make edits to the code, or even cut-and-paste the entire block to a different section of the file, and you’ll see the codemark move right along with the changes. Creating a codemark Create a codemark by selecting a block of code in your editor and then clicking on one of the icons that appears in the CodeStream pane next to your selection. If you're using a JetBrains IDE, such as IntelliJ, you can also create a codemark by using the \"+\" button that appears in the editor's gutter when you select a block of code. When you're viewing a diff, for either a feedback request or a pull request, the button will also appear when you hover in the gutter to make it easy to comment on a single line. Even when the CodeStream pane is closed or not in view, you can create a codemark via the CodeStream options in either the lightbulb or context menus. Lastly, you can also look for the \"+\" menu at the top of the CodeStream pane. Need to reach teammates that don’t spend a lot of time in the IDE? Or maybe some teammates that aren’t yet on CodeStream? You can optionally share a codemark out to Slack or Microsoft Teams. The Slack integration even allows your teammates to reply directly from Slack. Comment Codemarks The all-purpose codemark for linking any type of discussion to a block of code. Ask a question. Make a suggestion. Document some code. Make note of key sections of the codebase. The possibilities are endless! Issue Codemarks When something needs to get done there’s always a better chance of it happening if it’s captured as an issue, with someone’s name attached. Assign issues as a way of reporting bugs. Or manage your tech debt by capturing items as tracked issues instead of inline FIXMEs. If your team uses Asana, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket (cloud), Clubhouse, GitHub (cloud or Enterprise), GitLab (cloud or Self-Managed), Jira (cloud or Server), Linear, Trello, or YouTrack (cloud) for tracking issues, you can create an issue on one of those services directly from CodeStream. Just select the service you use from the dropdown at the top of the codemark form. After going through the authentication process with the selected service you'll now be able to select a destination for your issue. For example, with Jira you'll be able to select the appropriate issue type and project. Once the issue has been created on CodeStream, it will include a link to the issue that was created on the external service. In the example below you'll see the URL for the issue on Jira. And the issue on Jira includes a link to open the relevant code in your IDE. Bringing the right people into the discussion When you create a codemark, CodeStream automatically mentions the people that most recently touched of the code you are commenting on. They may be the best people to answer your question, but you can, of course, remove those mentions and manually mention someone else if appropriate. It may be the case that the people that have touched the code aren't yet on CodeStream, in which case CodeStream will provide checkboxes to have them notified via email. They can simply reply to the email to have their comment posted to CodeStream, and of course they can install CodeStream to participate from their IDE. Different versions of the code? Maybe you’re on a feature branch, have local changes, or simply haven’t pulled in a while. There are countless reasons why the code you’re looking at might be different than what a teammate is looking at, and as a result, there will be plenty of times when the code referenced in a codemark doesn’t match what you have locally. CodeStream recognizes these situations and includes the original version of the code block (i.e. at the time the codemark was created), the current version, and a diff. Keep in mind that with CodeStream you can discuss any line of code, in any source file, at any time, even if it’s code that you just typed into your editor and haven’t yet committed. CodeStream allows you to discuss code at the very earliest stages of the development process. Resolving codemarks Although not required, both comment and issue codemarks can be resolved. The Codemarks section of the CodeStream pane breaks out codemarks into Open, Resolved and Archived sections, and green, purple and gray icons are used to represent those different states. If you see a lot of Open/green codemarks in the codestream pane, that means that your teammates are being blocked by discussions and issues that haven't be resolved. You can add a comment at the same time your resolve the codemark, and you can also elect to archive the codemark at the same time. Advanced Features Multiple Ranges Many discussions about code involve more than just one block of code, and concepts are often best presented when you can refer to multiple code locations at once. Here are a few examples of multi-range codemark at work: A change to a function is being contemplated that will impact its name. Each instance of the function call can now be referenced in one discussion. A react component and its CSS styling aren’t interacting well, and you want to ask the team for input. You might select the div and the CSS rules you think should apply, so your teammates know exactly what you’re talking about. Clients which make API calls to the server might get an unexpected result. Select the code where you’re making the API call, and the handler in the API server, to connect the two actions together. To create a multi-range codemark, click on \"+ Add Code Block\". And then select another block of code from the same file, a different file, or even a different repo. You can intersperse the difference code blocks in your post by referring to each one as [#N] (or click the pin icon from one of the code blocks to insert the markdown for you), as in the following example. And here's how that example is rendered. Once you've created the codemark, you can easily jump between the different locations by clicking the Jump icon at the bottom-right of each code block. Note that when you edit a codemark you can add and remove code blocks, and you can change the location of any of the code blocks by clicking the dashed square icon. File Attachments Enrich your discussions about code by attaching files directly to code blocks. Think about how much more compelling your comments and documentation become when you... Attach a spec to guide the development of a new feature Attach a log file to help debug an issue in the code Attach a mockup to help clarify some UI work Attach a screenshot to highlight a problem When creating a code comment or issue, you can attach a file by dragging-and-dropping on the the description field, pasting from you clipboard, or by clicking the new paperclip icon. Images can even be displayed inline using markdown. Just click the pin icon to the right of the attachment, and CodeStream will insert the markdown for you. And now your teammate knows exactly what you’re looking for! You can click on files in the Attachments section to either download or open in the appropriate application. Tagging Look for the tag icon inside the codemark compose box to either select a tag or create a tag using any combination of color and text label. Tags are a great way to broadly organize and group your organization's codemarks, and the possibilities here are endless. Note that you can also filter by tag on the Filter & Search page. Related codemarks Click on the CodeStream icon in the codemark compose form to select other, related codemarks to “attach” to the current codemark. This allows you to easily establish a connection between different parts of a codebase. For example, when a change to one part of the codebase would require a change to another part, identify the dependency by creating two related codemarks. Once you’ve added the related codemarks they’ll be displayed in a “Related” section and you can click on any one to jump to that codemark and the corresponding section of the code. Managing codemarks Click on the ellipses menu for any codemark and you'll see options for managing the codemark. Share - In addition to sharing to Slack or Teams at the time you create a codemark, you can also share it anytime thereafter. Follow/Unfollow - Unfollow to stop receiving notifications for the codemark. Copy link - Get a permalink for the codemark to share it anywhere. Archive - If there’s a codemark that you don’t think is important enough to be on permanent display in a given file, but you don’t want to completely delete it, you can archive it instead. Settings in the codemarks section allow you to easily see all archived codemarks. Edit - Only the codemark's author can edit it. Delete - Only the codemark's author can delete it, but we encourage you to archive instead of delete unless you're positive the codemark won't have any future value. Inject as Inline Comment - If you'd like a specific codemark to become part of the repo use this option to have it added as an inline comment. You can select the appropriate format, and then indicate if you want to include timestamps, replies, or to have the comment wrapped at 80 characters. You can also elect to have the codemark archived once it's been added as an inline comment. Reposition codemark - In most cases, a codemark will automatically remain linked to the block of code it refers to as the file changes over time. For example, if you cut the block of code and paste it at a different location in the file, the codemark will move right along with it. There are some scenarios, however, that CodeStream isn't able to handle automatically. For example, if you pasted the block of code into a different file. In these cases, Reposition codemark allows you to select the new location of the block of code so that the codemark is displayed properly.",

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and errorBeacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Note: You only need to modify the beacon and errorBeacon properties in the NREUM.info object. These values will override the default values found in the NR loader script. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

Troubleshoot data ingest with NrIntegrationError Our NrIntegrationError event is used to capture issues related to: Exceeding of our data ingest limits Exceeding of our query limits Malformed data Configuration issues You can run NRQL queries to analyze NrIntegrationError error messages. You can also set up alerts to be notified when specific types of errors, or certain quantities of errors, occur. NrIntegrationError events are primarily categorized by the feature that is sending them, as indicated by the newRelicFeature attribute. Values include: Metrics indicates an issue with Metric API ingest. Event API indicates an issue with Event API ingest. Logs indicates an issue with logs ingest. Distributed Tracing indicates an issue with distributed tracing (Span) data. For attribute definitions, see the data dictionary. Query and alert You can query NrIntegrationError events using NRQL, and set up NRQL alert conditions to get notified when issues happen. Here are some examples of queries: Query of Event API issues Here's a simple query of NrIntegrationError.

      "body": "One of the ways to report custom data to New Relic is with custom events and attributes. Have questions about why you'd use custom data? See Introduction to custom data. Requirements For event and attribute formatting requirements and best practices, see Limits and requirements. Avoid rate limits Reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance. It may also result in approaching or passing data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Example use cases Two popular custom data solutions are custom events and custom attributes. There are several ways to accomplish this (more on that later in this doc), depending on your New Relic implementation and tools. Here are some common use cases for implementing custom events and attributes. Using custom attributes Custom attributes are often used to add important business and operational context to existing events. Business context might include: Customer token Customer market segment Customer value classification Workflow control values not obvious in the URIStem User/product/account privilege context Operational context might include: Which feature flags were used What datastore was accessed What cache was accessed What errors were detected and ignored (fault partitioning) Using custom events Event data is one of New Relic's four core data types. We recommend reading that definition to understand what we mean by \"event\" and why that data type is most used for reporting specific types of activity. The use cases for custom events varies widely: basically they are used for any type of activity that an organization deems important and that is not already being monitored. A couple examples: An event might represent an activity involving multiple actions, like a customer purchasing a certain combination of products. An event might record backup activity. For example, they might set up reporting of events that represent production backups of their SOLR instances into an event table, with a timestamp of when it occurred, which cluster, and the duration. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser monitoring agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure monitoring agent Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data.

Options for custom data We have a wide variety of agents and integrations that bring in various types of data. But you may need to bring in data that isn't reported by default. Options for bringing in custom data include: Use our open source telemetry integrations. We have integrations for reporting data from OpenCensus, OpenTelemetry, DropWizard, Prometheus, and more. Configure our agents to send custom data. If you're using one of our APM agents, browser agents, or mobile agents, you can configure them to send custom data. To learn more, see the docs for the tool you're using. Create your own solution for reporting telemetry data with our language-specific Telemetry SDKs. Or use the underlying APIs directly: Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API. Report data from your operating system or network. If you're using our infrastructure agent, you might want to use our Flex integration, which lets you use simple config files to report data. Build a New Relic One application.

Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime Use native deploy To use Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with your Node.js app: Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Optional: Set environment variables to configure the Node.js agent's GAE app.yaml file. Use the Google Cloud SDK's gcloud command line tool to deploy GAE apps. To deploy your Node.js app to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project new-relic-apm-nodejs app deploy Copy Google App Engine automatically includes your Node.js app's newrelic.js configuration file in the deployed package. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. You can deploy the app without any special configuration. For more information about deploying and configuring your Node.js app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Node.js Google App Engine's tutorial to deploy a Node.js app 1.

Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Optional: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in New Relic APM. If you notice performance issues, disable GAE health checks. In your app.yaml, add: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using Full-Stack Observability options like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). If the name begins with anything other than an alphabetical character, enclose the name with backticks in your NRQL query. For example: FROM `0_hello` SELECT count(*) Copy Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default mobile monitoring events using the mobile agent SDKs. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the crash event trail UI. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams.

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description SyntheticCheck SyntheticCheck returns metrics from one run of a specific monitor. These metrics include duration information for the monitor, location of the monitor check, size of the request and response headers, the type of monitor, and a timestamp. Each time a synthetic monitor runs a check, details about the check are captured in theSyntheticCheck event type. SyntheticCheck events contain details specific to the check to provide visibility such as the status, type of monitor, and size of request and response headers. SyntheticRequest SyntheticRequest returns results from individual HTTP requests made during a check. The data gathered include job information, location, type of content for request, duration information, request size, and page load information. With each simple or scripted monitor check, we capture each individual HTTP request made during the check. The HTTP details are captured at a more granular level than the SyntheticCheck event type. SyntheticPrivateLocationStatus Every monitor check running on a private location triggers capacity details for that private location. These details are captured in a SyntheticPrivateLocationStatus event. This provides visibility into the capacity of a private location and whether additional minions are required to support the workload. SyntheticPrivateMinion If you have private locations, such as those inside your firewall, you can view information regarding those locations with the SyntheticPrivateMinion event. Each private minion running sends health details to SyntheticPrivateMinion every 30 seconds. This allows you to understand the health of the private minion running at the location.

      "body": "Data partitions are a way to group or organize log data for faster and more efficient querying. When a query targets a single partition, New Relic's Logs UI: Scans less unrelated data. Returns results faster. Accounts can have multiple partitions, and multiple partitions can be queried at the same time. Data partitions also allow data to be mapped to an alternative, or “secondary” namespace with a fixed 30-day retention. This is useful for maintaining compliance with privacy-centric regulations and standards like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Plan your partition Before you start creating partitions, make sure you have the right permissions and a partition plan. Important Logs are routed to partitions during the ingestion process, before data is written to NRDB. Partition rules will not affect logs that were ingested before the rule was created. Required roles and permissions Users require an Admin role to create and modify partition rules. Sizing and organizing a partition You can gain significant performance improvements with proper use of data partitions. Organizing your data into discrete partitions enables you to query them separately or all together. The goals of partitioning your data should be: Create data partitions that align with concepts in your environment or organization that are static or change infrequently (for example, by business unit, team, environment, service, etc.). Ensure each partition remains below 1 TB of daily ingest for optimal performance. Having more partitions allows for more targeted searches, but creating too many partitions can make logs hard to find and increase administrative overhead. Finding the right balance is important. We support 100 partitions maximum per account, but the optimal number for most accounts is 10 to 15 partitions. Choosing a namespace A partition’s namespace determines its retention period. We offer two retention options: Standard: The account’s default retention determined by your New Relic subscription. This is the maximum retention period available in your account and is the namespace you'll select for most of your partitions. Secondary: 30-day retention. All logs sent to a partition that's a member of the Secondary namespace will be purged on a rolling basis 30 days after having been ingested. Secondary retention is not a cost control mechanism; data is billed on ingest. Create partition rules From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Data partitions, then create a Log_ partition name with the retention namespace, optional description, and matching criteria. To create a new partition rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Data partitions, then click Create partition rule. Define a Partition name as an alphanumeric string that begins with Log_. Add an optional description. Select the retention namespace for the partition. Set your rule's Matching criteria: Select EQUALS to target logs that match your criteria exactly, or select LIKE to apply a fuzzy match. Click the Enable Rule slider, and click Create. To view a list of data partitions: From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Data partitions. Search data partitions The default partition for all Logs accounts is Log. Any log that is not affected by a partition rule will be stored in the Log partition by default. You can query multiple partitions simultaneously. For best performance, select the smallest number of partitions possible. To search data partitions: From Views and Attributes on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Select partitions.

Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Install Snapcraft, and then run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Install Homebrew, and then run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Install Scoop, and then run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Copy or write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity Using your entity guid, you can add tags right away. Invoke the entities tags create command. If you want to add multiple tags, use tag sets: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostConditions directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your main.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add main.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.12\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration.

Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. Get notification channels The notificationChannels query allows you to paginate through all of your notification channels per account. You can also use the notificationChannel query to get a specific notification channel by its ID. Tip Note that certain secret fields (for example passwords or API keys) are obfuscated in the returned fields. List all notification channels for an account This example returns every field for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, up to the page limit of 200.

An empty nextCursor signals that you have reached the end of the result set. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"notificationChannels\": { \"channels\": [ { \"id\": \"250\", \"name\": \"Channel 1\", \"type\": \"SLACK\" }, { \"id\": \"713\", \"name\": \"Channel 2\", \"type\": \"WEBHOOK\" }, // ... +198 more notification channels in reality ], \"nextCursor\": \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\", \"totalCount\": 268 } } } } } } Copy In your next request, provide the cursor like so, updating each subsequent request to return the updated cursor, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels(cursor: \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\") { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Find a specific notification channel by id If you have a specific notification channel's ID, the API allows you to look it up directly. Note that because the specific channel is a concrete type implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface, you may need to specify certain fields using the ... on syntax for inline fragments. In this example, we are retrieving a Slack channel: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannel(id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id name type ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } } } } } } Copy List notification channels with their associated policies This example returns the ID, name, and type for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, as well as a list of every policy that is associated with that channel. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type associatedPolicies { policies { id name } totalCount } } nextCursor totalCount } } } } } Copy Create a notification channel In order to create an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to create (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Once a notification channel has been created, it can be associated with one or more alert policies. Once associated, those channels will receive notifications from those policies when conditions are violated. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only create a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Create an email notification channel An example create mutation for an email notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { emails: [\"email@example.com\"], includeJson: true, name: \"Some Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type config { emails

alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { integrationUrl: \"https://company.instance.xmatters.com/api/xm/v<version>/...\", name: \"xMatters notification channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type config { integrationUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Update a notification channel In order to update an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to change (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Consistent with other GraphQL APIs, you can update a single field on the channel without knowing anything other than the channel's ID. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only update a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Update an email notification channel An example update mutation for an email notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { name: \"Updated Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an OpsGenie notification channel An example update mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { name: \"OpsGenie updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a PagerDuty notification channel An example update mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Slack notification channel An example update mutation for a Slack notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a VictorOps notification channel An example update mutation for a VictorOps notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { name: \"VictorOps updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Webhook notification channel An example update mutation for a Webhook notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { name: \"Webhook updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an xMatters notification channel An example update mutation for an xMatters notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { name: \"xMatters updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Delete a notification channel You can delete a notification channel with only the account ID and the channel ID. Note that deleting a channel dissociates it from all policies, meaning that no further notifications will be sent to that channel. mutation { alertsNotificationChannelDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Associate channels to a policy Creating an alert notification channel is not enough: Once the channel has been created, it needs to be associated to one or more policies. Once associated to a policy, the channel can recieve alert notifications when conditions on that policy go into violation. In this example, we associate two channels with a policy: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsAddToPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Dissociate a channel from a policy In those instances where a notification channel has outlived its usefulness (for example, an email list that has been retired), the time has come to dissociate that channel from the policy (or policies) that are sending alert notifications to it. This API call leaves the channel itself intact, but removes it from the specified policy. In this example, we are removing two channels from a policy (leaving any others in place), and getting back confirmation that those two channel IDs have been removed: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsRemoveFromPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Tip Removing an alert notification channel from a policy does not delete the channel because it might be used by other policies. On the other hand, deleting a channel will cause all associated policies to stop sending alert notifications to that channel.",

If left empty, make sure you pass title so that users get a reference about the data the column shows. classNamestring Appends class names to the component. onClickfunction Callback fired any time the user clicks on the header. When clicked, sorting information (and the next sorting state) will be passed as the second parameter. Use it rather than computing it yourself. function ( event : React.MouseEvent, sortingData : Object ) sortableboolean DEFAULT false Whether the column is sortable. This means that the up and down arrows will be shown, side to the heading text. Sorting is a controlled component interface, you are in charge of listening for the sorting event and applying the sorting to the corresponding column, by changing its sortingOrder prop. sortingFunctionfunction Method for sorting rows. The default method will usually do the right thing (alphabetical ordering for text, numerical ordering for numbers and boolean grouping), but if needed this can be overridden. The function takes two parameters (a and b) and has to return a negative number if a is considered to appear before b, a positive one if it's considered to appear after, and zero if both values are identical. Each of the objects passed to the callback contains the value for the given row (i.e. the result of calling value over the row), the row item (as item), the index of the row (as index) and all the items in the items array (as items). Generally you will compare rows using a.item and b.item. function ( a : object, b : object ) => number sortingOrdernumber DEFAULT Number . MAX_SAFE_INTEGER Establishes the sorting order. A lowest number indicates a highest sorting priority, meaning that 0 will be the first column sorted, and if two items are identical, we will use column 1 and so on. Columns that do not have an explicit sorting order are used after all columns that do have it, and they are applied in order of appearance. sortingTypeenum DEFAULT TableHeaderCell . SORTING_TYPE . NONE Establishes the sorting for the column. Columns are sorted based on the element returned by the value prop. <One of TableHeaderCell.SORTING_TYPE.ASCENDING , TableHeaderCell.SORTING_TYPE.DESCENDING , TableHeaderCell.SORTING_TYPE.NONE , > styleobject Inline style for custom styling. testIdstring Adds a data-test-id attribute. Use it to target the component in unit and E2E tests. Note: You might not see data-test-id attributes as they are removed from the DOM, to debug them pass a e2e-test query parameter to the URL. titlestring Establishes the title of the cell. This is used for tooltip purposes, when the width of the column is small enough to not show the entire heading. Defaults to the stringified version of the provided children. valuefunction Function that is used to extract the raw value representing a column. The raw value may be a boolean (e.g. if you render a checkbox), a number (if you render a metric) or text for others. It is called with an object containing the item representing the row, its index in the items array passed to the table, and the items themselves. This function is used for sorting the table (by the given value) as well as for the heuristics of 'fit-content' widths. widthstring DEFAULT 1fr Represents the width of the column. It is always a string, and it can be of one of the following types: 'fit-content': the column will take the minimum required space to allocate all items in the column. For virtualized lists, a heuristic will be used to avoid rendering all cells. 'YYpx': where YY is a number, represents the width of the column in pixels. 'YY%': where YY is a number, represents the width of the column in percentage, relative to the size of the available space where the table is being rendered. 'YYfr': where YY is a number, it represents a fraction of the available width. Fractions are proportional ones to others; for instance, a table with two columns (1fr and 2fr) will have the second column twice as large as the first one. If, after computing the widths, the overall size of the table does not cover the available space, all columns will be proportionally stretched to fit all available space.",

Should be used only for positioning and spacing purposes. compactboolean DEFAULT false Establishes whether the table should render in compact mode (compact mode has narrower rows).

They are required when rendering items with a render callback. Each item can have any structure and type possible, and will the corresponding one will be provided when rendering each element list. mainColumnnumber DEFAULT 0 Column containing the main data identifying the row.

Note: The multivalue mode works only in the default size, not in compact. onLoadMorefunction Callback fired when more items must be loaded. This happens when you're lazy loading the items and the items that are about to render cannot be found in the items array. This callback should be used to fetch/load the missing items from the backend or other sources. The returned Promise should be resolved once item data has finished loading. It will be used to determine when to refresh the list with the newly-loaded data. This callback may be called multiple times in reaction to a single scroll event. function ( cursor : Cursor Items to load. ) onSelectfunction Function called when the user clicks over a row checkbox. It is called with the event of the checkbox, as well as with an object containing the item representing the row, its index in the items array passed to the table, and the items themselves. When the user selects or unselects the header checkbox (select / unselect all), the callback will be called once for every item, representing individual clicks over each row. The header checkbox state is automatically controlled by the table. function ( event : React.ChangeEvent, selectedItem : SelectedCallbackArgument ) rowCountnumber Number of rows. By default it's equal to length of array passed in the items prop. You should specify the rowCount when you know the total number of items but you want to lazy load them while scrolling. selectedfunction Function that returns whether a row is selected. It needs to return a boolean representing the state of the row. It is called with an object containing the item representing the row, its index in the items array passed to the table, and the items themselves. function ( item : SelectedCallbackArgument ) => boolean selectionTypeenum DEFAULT Table . SELECTION_TYPE . BULK Sets the selection mode of the Table. Use it along with onSelect and selected props to determine which row is checked by the user. Table.SELECTION_TYPE.BULK displays checkboxes per each row, along with a checkbox in the header to select all items. When an item is selected, header actions become available. Table.SELECTION_TYPE.SINGLE doesn't display checkboxes, the user picks a row by just clicking on it. Though not enforced in the component, the selected callback should return true only for one item.

      "body": "You have options for the type and the amount of data you ingest when you install Auto-telemetry with Pixie. During install, use Helm to reduce or exclude data, either by excluding specific namespaces or pods, or by collecting data for only the nodes you want. Exclude namespaces and pods If you want to reduce the amount of Pixie data that New Relic ingests, you can exclude namespaces or pods by adding the following parameters to your Helm chart during installation. Note that the data still exists in Pixie: excludeNamespacesRegex - use to identify the namespaces that you want to exclude from sending observability data to New Relic. If empty, data for all namespaces is sent to New Relic. For example: --set newrelic-pixie.excludeNamespacesRegex=\"examplenamespace-1|examplenamespace-2\" Copy excludePodsRegex - use to identify pods across all namespaces that you want to exclude from sending observability data to New Relic. If empty, data for all pods (except those in excluded namespaces) is sent to New Relic. For example: --set newrelic-pixie.excludePodsRegex=\"examplepod-1|examplepod-2\" Copy These two configuration options provide additional control over the Metric and Span data sent to New Relic from Pixie. For example, if you wanted to configure the newrelic-pixie integration to exclude all namespaces except for px-sock-shop and kafka-demo, append the following config parameter to your Helm install or Helm upgrade command. --set newrelic-pixie.excludeNamespacesRegex=\"default|kube-node-lease|kube-public|kube-system|newrelic|newrelic-custom-metrics|olm|px-operator\" Copy Or, if you wanted to exclude pods running in a non-excluded namespace, you could add another configuration parameter to your Helm install or Helm upgrade. Instead of matching exact names, you can use a simple regex to match pod names related to load testing, just as an example. --set newrelic-pixie.excludePodsRegex=\"load-test.*|loadgen.*\" Copy If you're performing a brand new install, you'll need to append excludeNamespacesRegex and excludePodsRegex to the helm upgrade --install command provided by New Relic's guided install: kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pixie-labs/pixie/main/k8s/operator/crd/base/px.dev_viziers.yaml && \\ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pixie-labs/pixie/main/k8s/operator/helm/crds/olm_crd.yaml && \\ helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com && helm repo update && \\ kubectl create namespace newrelic ; helm upgrade --install newrelic-bundle newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --set global.licenseKey=<NR LICENSE KEY> \\ --set global.cluster=pixie-auto-telemetry \\ --namespace=newrelic \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-pixie.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-pixie.apiKey=<PIXIE API KEY> \\ --set pixie-chart.enabled=true \\ --set pixie-chart.deployKey=<PIXIE DEPLOY KEY> \\ --set pixie-chart.clusterName=pixie-auto-telemetry \\ --set newrelic-pixie.excludeNamespacesRegex=\"default|kube-node-lease|kube-public|kube-system|newrelic|newrelic-custom-metrics|olm|px-operator\" \\ --set newrelic-pixie.excludePodsRegex=\"load-test.*|loadgen.*\" Copy If you're just upgrading an existing install, then this is a much simpler approach: helm upgrade newrelic-bundle newrelic/nri-bundle --reuse-values -n newrelic --set newrelic-pixie.excludeNamespacesRegex=\"default|kube-node-lease|kube-public|kube-system|newrelic|newrelic-custom-metrics|olm|px-operator Copy Learn more about the available parameters for the newrelic-pixie Helm chart here. Use Kubernetes features to collect selected data When you deploy Auto-telemetry with Pixie, you're actually enabling the Auto-telemetry with Pixie Helm chart, as well as other New Relic components included in the New Relic infrastructure bundle. The Pixie Edge Module (PEM) pods are deployed to the cluster as a Kubernetes DaemonSet. This means that by default, a pod is scheduled to every cluster node and is responsible for collecting all of the observability metrics for that node. In Kubernetes, you can assign pods to a specific subset of cluster nodes using nodeSelectors, taints/tolerations, and node affinity/anti-affinity. That way, you'll only collect metrics for the nodes you choose, instead of every node. This is helpful if you only want to deploy Auto-telemetry with Pixie to five of your ten cluster nodes, for example. Maybe the designated five nodes are responsible for high-priority workloads, or perhaps you're running both Linux and Windows nodes in your cluster and only want to deploy on the Linux nodes, since Windows nodes are not currently supported. You can now assign pods to a subset of nodes by providing an additional option to the guided installation command. This option passes an escaped JSON string to the Auto-telemetry with Pixie chart, which enables a nodeSelector that only schedules the PEM DaemonSet on nodes with the label pixie=allowed. --set pixie-chart.patches.vizier-pem='\\{\\\"spec\\\"\\: \\{\\\"template\\\"\\: \\{\\\"spec\\\"\\: \\{ \\\"nodeSelector\\\"\\: \\{\\\"pixie\\\"\\: \\\"allowed\\\" \\}\\}\\}\\}\\}' Copy If you're using a values file, common with Helm, then this is what that would look like in the nri-bundle values.yaml: pixie-chart: enabled: true patches: vizier-pem: '{\"spec\": {\"template\": {\"spec\": { \"nodeSelector\": {\"pixie\": \"allowed\" }}}}}' Copy This approach gives you a multitude of configuration options; you just need to stick with the standard Kubernetes spec.",

Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the account switcher. account switcher If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account organization, you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: *EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) *CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. *EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one infrastructure integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, as well as the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing plan, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostConditions directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your main.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add main.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. Terragrunt is a thin wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state. In this guide, you will use Terragrunt to generate your Terraform configurations, create files with Terragrunt, and reuse the Terragrunt configuration to manage multiple environments. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic Infrastructure agent for your host. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: You will also need to install Terragrunt to follow this guide: bash Copy $ brew install terragrunt To follow the examples in this guide, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 6 Create a new configuration Terragrunt is a wrapper that provides extra tooling for your Terraform configurations. In the next steps, you will create a new configuration using Terragrunt, Terraform, and New Relic. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terragrunt-config && cd terragrunt-config In the new directory, create a terragrunt.hcl file, create a ./src directory, and create a ./environments directory: bash Copy $ touch terragrunt.hcl $ mkdir src $ mkdir environments Inside of your environments folder, create a folder named dev. In the ./src directory, create a main.tf and provider.tf files: bash Copy $ mkdir environments/dev $ touch src/main.tf $ touch src/provider.tf In the provider.tf file add the appropriate Terraform and New Relic provider configuration information: terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } Copy In the main.tf add a New Relic alert policy named DemoPolicy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Copy In the ./environments/dev directory create a new file named terragrunt.hcl bash Copy $ cd ./environments/dev/ $ touch terragrunt.hcl Within the dev folder update the terragrunt.hcl file by adding the following include statement. The include statement tells Terragrunt to use any .hcl confgiuration files it finds in parent folders. include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } Copy Next, add a Terraform block to provide Terragrunt with a Terraform source reference. terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Now you need to configure the provider with your New Relic account details. You will need your New Relic user API key and account ID. provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you have a single account: The account ID is displayed on the API keys page. If your organization has multiple accounts: From one.newrelic.com, select Entity explorer and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page. Tip Documentation about the New Relic provider is provided on the Terraform doc site. Update the provider.tf file to define the New Relic account variables that will help keep the Terraform configuration dynamic. variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy In your terminal, change directories to the environments/dev folder and run the command terragrunt init: bash Copy $ terragrunt init Terraform init sets up a bit of context, sets up environment variables, and then runs terraform init. You will see the following output: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. [terragrunt] [/Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev] 2021/02/02 13:30:31 Copying lock file [output] from /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev/.terragrunt-cache/e-PoBgWhdv3v8QGOtDQxS_WeYu4/ 69zjIFUfApJiUt8gFmi-6-dcPe8/.terraform.lock.hcl to /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy $ terragrunt plan Terragrunt starts to run but pauses to ask for the inputs to the New Relic account variables added to the provider.tf file. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2/02 13:32:08 Running command: terraform plan var.newrelic_account_id Enter a value: Interrupt received. Exit the terragrunt plan process with CTRL+C . In the environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl file, add an inputs block to provide the values for your New Relic account variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy The updated terragrunt.hcl only has the include, terraform, and inputs block include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Now, when you run terragrunt plan, Terragrunt will provide the input block's values, no longer prompting the command line for values. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Run terragrunt apply. After Terraform finishes process, check your New Relic account for the new Demo Policy. Step 2 of 6 Adding to your configuration Now that you have a basic New Relic configuration created, add configurations built in the Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides in this step. Tip If you haven't done the previous developer guides, you can copy the configurations for this section from the Terragrunt Intro Github Repo. Update the main.tf to include the additional terraform configurations. Update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy You have added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. To clone the module from GitHub, run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply. After Terraform is done processing, You will see your Demo Policy now has two conditions in your New Relic account and one alert channel attached. Step 3 of 6 Using your Environment as a Terragrunt Variable Using Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you are running to the name of the data you are creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create a new input for env_name inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy in the main.tf file add a new variable for 'env_name' variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Using string interpolation, add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks. resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to the configuration name. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Currently, the environment variable name is hardcoded into the root terragrunt.hcl file. You want to avoid having your variables hardcoded, using a terragrunt built-in function will pass the value. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use the path_relative_to_include() built-in function and pass the value has the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output, the env_name variable will have the entire ./environments/dev/ path. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Next, update the terragrunt.hcl to only include 'dev' as the env_name variable. Adding a locals block creates a local variable, using the replace built-in function will remove the unwanted parts of the relative path, and update the inputs block to use the local variable. locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output the env_name variable will now have 'dev:' added. Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Step 4 of 6 Storing the State Remotely At the moment, the state file is local. The next steps will update your Terraform configurations to remove the local state file and use a file stored remotely in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, various state files will need to be store in separate S3 buckets, not to override each other. Terragrunt allows you to generate files on the fly. Adding the remote_state block into the root level terragrunt.hcl file, you will generate a new file named backend.tf. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"my-terraform-state\" key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true } } Copy After adding the remote_state block, you will need to give the configuration for the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state. Tip To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Now, update the remote_state block to provide your S3 bucket and update the key to use the local environment variable created previously. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Next, run terragrunt plan. If you look in the Amazon S3 bucket, you will see a folder named envs. Within the envs folder is a directory called devs containing terraform.tfstate file. Tip To see the files created by Terragrunt, look inside of the ./environments/dev directory. There is a hidden directory named terragrunt-cache. Within the terragrunt-cache directory, you will see the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Step 5 of 6 Creating a New Environment Now that you have a working configuration for your dev environment, you will create a new environment reusing the dev configurations in the next steps. In the environments directory, create a new folder names nonprod. In the nonprod folder, create a new terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl In the nonprod terragrunt.hcl file copy over the configuration from the environment terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you are using a different account for your nonprod environment, you can update the inputs with a new New Relic account ID and API key. Inside of your nonprod directory, run terragrunt init then run terragrunt apply. In the output, you will see Terraform has created a new set of resources. The new resources should have the nonprod name prefixed. Step 6 of 6 Terragrunt has created two environments, but there is no difference between them other than the name. Adding variables in the configurations allows your configurations to be more dynamic. In the next steps, you will add variables to your configurations. In the main.tf add new variables for the Host Conditions modules cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage values: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy In the main.tf update the HostConditions module values to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Run terragrunt plan. In the output, the HostConditions values have changed to use the variable defaults. Next, you want to pass the values into your environment configurations by adding the inputs block variables. In the nonprod/terragrunt.hcl file, add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy Run terragrunt apply. In your New Relic account, you will see a new policy with configurations changed based on the environment. Conclusion Congratulations! You've used Terragrunt to generate your New Relic configurations and manage multiple environments. Review the Terragrunt Intro Example, New Relic Terraform provider documentation, and Terragrunt quick start to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "You can manage your alert notification channels using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. Get notification channels The notificationChannels query allows you to paginate through all of your notification channels per account. You can also use the notificationChannel query to get a specific notification channel by its ID. Tip Note that certain secret fields (for example passwords or API keys) are obfuscated in the returned fields. List all notification channels for an account This example returns every field for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, up to the page limit of 200. Note how we use inline fragments to refer to the specific fields on the concrete types implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { config { integrationUrl } } ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { config { baseUrl basicAuth { password username } customHttpHeaders { name value } customPayloadBody customPayloadType } } ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { config { key routeKey } } ... on AlertsUserNotificationChannel { config { userId } } ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { config { apiKey } } ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { config { apiKey dataCenterRegion recipients tags teams } } ... on AlertsHipChatNotificationChannel { config { authToken baseUrl roomId } } ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { config { emails includeJson } } ... on AlertsCampfireNotificationChannel { config { room subdomain token } } } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Paginate through notification channels with cursor pagination If a given account's list of notification channels exceeds the 200 channel page limit, you can use the pagination cursor to retrieve additional pages. With cursor pagination, you continue to request additional pages using the nextCursor until that field returns empty in the response. An empty nextCursor signals that you have reached the end of the result set. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"notificationChannels\": { \"channels\": [ { \"id\": \"250\", \"name\": \"Channel 1\", \"type\": \"SLACK\" }, { \"id\": \"713\", \"name\": \"Channel 2\", \"type\": \"WEBHOOK\" }, // ... +198 more notification channels in reality ], \"nextCursor\": \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\", \"totalCount\": 268 } } } } } } Copy In your next request, provide the cursor like so, updating each subsequent request to return the updated cursor, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels(cursor: \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\") { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Find a specific notification channel by id If you have a specific notification channel's ID, the API allows you to look it up directly. Note that because the specific channel is a concrete type implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface, you may need to specify certain fields using the ... on syntax for inline fragments. In this example, we are retrieving a Slack channel: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannel(id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id name type ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } } } } } } Copy List notification channels with their associated policies This example returns the ID, name, and type for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, as well as a list of every policy that is associated with that channel. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type associatedPolicies { policies { id name } totalCount } } nextCursor totalCount } } } } } Copy Create a notification channel In order to create an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to create (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Once a notification channel has been created, it can be associated with one or more alert policies. Once associated, those channels will receive notifications from those policies when conditions are violated. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only create a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Create an email notification channel An example create mutation for an email notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { emails: [\"email@example.com\"], includeJson: true, name: \"Some Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type config { emails includeJson } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an OpsGenie notification channel An example create mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { apiKey: \"api-key-from-opsgenie\", dataCenterRegion: US, name: \"OpsGenie notification channel name\", recipients: [\"user@example.com\"], tags: [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"], teams: [\"team1\", \"team2\"] } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey teams tags recipients dataCenterRegion } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a PagerDuty notification channel An example create mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty notification channel name\", apiKey: \"api-key-from-pagerduty\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Slack notification channel An example create mutation for a Slack notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack notification channel name\", teamChannel: \"#team-channel\", url: \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/FAKE/MOREFAKE/IMAGINARYEXAMPLEURLCHUNK\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type config { teamChannel url } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a VictorOps notification channel An example create mutation for a VictorOps notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { key: \"example-api-key-from-victorops\", name: \"VictorOps notification channel name\", routeKey: \"example-route-key\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type config { key routeKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Webhook notification channel An example create mutation for a Webhook notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { baseUrl: \"https://example.com/webhook\", basicAuth: { password: \"t0t4lly-s3cr3t-p455w0rd\", username: \"webhook-user\" }, customHttpHeaders: [ {name: \"X-Api-Key\", value: \"100%-real-api-key\"}, {name:

alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { integrationUrl: \"https://company.instance.xmatters.com/api/xm/v<version>/...\", name: \"xMatters notification channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type config { integrationUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Update a notification channel In order to update an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to change (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Consistent with other GraphQL APIs, you can update a single field on the channel without knowing anything other than the channel's ID. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only update a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Update an email notification channel An example update mutation for an email notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { name: \"Updated Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an OpsGenie notification channel An example update mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { name: \"OpsGenie updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a PagerDuty notification channel An example update mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Slack notification channel An example update mutation for a Slack notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a VictorOps notification channel An example update mutation for a VictorOps notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { name: \"VictorOps updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Webhook notification channel An example update mutation for a Webhook notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { name: \"Webhook updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an xMatters notification channel An example update mutation for an xMatters notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { name: \"xMatters updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Delete a notification channel You can delete a notification channel with only the account ID and the channel ID. Note that deleting a channel dissociates it from all policies, meaning that no further notifications will be sent to that channel. mutation { alertsNotificationChannelDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Associate channels to a policy Creating an alert notification channel is not enough: Once the channel has been created, it needs to be associated to one or more policies. Once associated to a policy, the channel can recieve alert notifications when conditions on that policy go into violation. In this example, we associate two channels with a policy: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsAddToPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Dissociate a channel from a policy In those instances where a notification channel has outlived its usefulness (for example, an email list that has been retired), the time has come to dissociate that channel from the policy (or policies) that are sending alert notifications to it. This API call leaves the channel itself intact, but removes it from the specified policy. In this example, we are removing two channels from a policy (leaving any others in place), and getting back confirmation that those two channel IDs have been removed: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsRemoveFromPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Tip Removing an alert notification channel from a policy does not delete the channel because it might be used by other policies. On the other hand, deleting a channel will cause all associated policies to stop sending alert notifications to that channel.",

      "body": "New Relic One is the platform that gives you access to core platform capabilities like querying data and building charts, our more curated observability UI experiences features, and our alerting and Applied Intelligence tools. With New Relic One, you can see and act on all the data throughout your entire system. To access New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com. Or, if you report data to the EU data center go to one.eu.newrelic.com. Tip Learn more about New Relic One’s basic UI features. Quickly understand context We provide multiple ways to understand your system's dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems. New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity! If you want to... Use this Have an overall view of your system, and drill down to get performance details. Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the entities (that is, all applications, services, hosts, or containers) in your system. Gain extensive visibility into each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected. Use the New Relic Navigator to give you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And use the New Relic Lookout to spot entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Provide context for your entities. Add tags to all your entities. Or create tags for teams and all the services they monitor. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. See how each part of your system is connected. Service maps illustrate your upstream and downstream dependencies. Visualize the aggregated health and activity data from all you monitor. Group and monitor any entities together into functional team-focused, project-focused groupings, or any other attribute, with workloads. Fetch and analyze specific data. Get more context while you query with the query builder, which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Find a service or dashboard in a complex environment. Search by name across all accounts in the unified search, or filter the explorer by tags or text. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. View a list of all the dependencies for a service.

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Incident Intelligence events One billing factor is how many incident events your organization sends to Incident Intelligence for correlation and analysis. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, Incident Intelligence comes with a certain number of free incident events per month. (Our original pricing plan doesn't have a free tier.) You can track usage and cost in two places in the UI: In the usage UI From the Incident Intelligence system settings UI page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, then click Incident Intelligence, and then click System settings. Determine event source When you set up Incident Intelligence data sources, the incident events ingested by those sources are what count towards your total. To see the sources affecting your billing, go to the Sources page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, click Incident Intelligence, and then click Sources. Stop reporting events Go to the Incident Intelligence Sources UI page and disconnect all the sources you don’t want. If all sources are removed, no data is sent to Incident Intelligence. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl.

Step 4 of 8 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The nerdpacks=local query string directs the UI to load your visualization from the local server.

This is because you first need to introduce the selectedChart property to the visualization component. Then, you use selectedChart to determine the chart type to render. Replace your SegmentedControl with the configurable property Step 1 of 5 Open your visualization's index.js file. You'll be working here for the rest of the guide.

Global Performance data sets data are useful for: Existing New Relic customers who want to gain general monitoring and troubleshooting insights from a curated collection of aggregated, real-world data. Newcomers who want to get a feel for New Relic’s dashboards and data tools and view real data visualizations in order to make informed decisions about how to add their own data to New Relic. This resource provides information about the Global Performance data sets, how they work, what they do, and current options for accessing Global Performance data. Public API Performance dashboard Important Please note: Global Performance data sets are presented as-is. Global Performance data sets represent an aggregate of samples across a range of sources, and New Relic makes no effort to attempt to confirm the correctness, completeness, or veracity of the data. This data should not be relied on as the sole source of information for any purpose you may use it, and New Relic is not responsible for decisions made in reliance on this data. Global Performance data sets should not be viewed as either an endorsement or a recommendation by New Relic of the technologies represented in the data sets. Access valuable data and try out New Relic Our first Global Performance data set, Public API Performance, offers a large body of real-world, real-time data about the performance of public APIs including AWS, Google, and more as experienced by New Relic customers (as authorized). Because this data is already flowing through New Relic, you can access it within seconds of activating your account, and test drive New Relic dashboarding and querying capabilities in the process. There’s no need to connect your own data sources to New Relic first, although we recommend you do so because adding your own data is easy, free, and the best way to understand how New Relic can serve your business needs. Get started with the Public API Performance dashboard To help you get started using Public API Performance data, we've created a Public API Performance dashboard. This dashboard provides both actionable general insights and analytics and also an example of how you might apply dashboarding capabilities to your own data. Both new and existing customers should be able to view Global Performance data in the Public API Performance dashboard quickly and easliy. To start using this dashboard, see Explore the Public API Performance dashboard.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABlE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "New Relic One is the platform that gives you access to core platform capabilities like querying data and building charts, our more curated observability UI experiences features, and our alerting and Applied Intelligence tools. With New Relic One, you can see and act on all the data throughout your entire system. To access New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com. Or, if you report data to the EU data center go to one.eu.newrelic.com. Tip Learn more about New Relic One’s basic UI features. Quickly understand context We provide multiple ways to understand your system's dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems. New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity! If you want to... Use this Have an overall view of your system, and drill down to get performance details. Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the entities (that is, all applications, services, hosts, or containers) in your system. Gain extensive visibility into each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected. Use the New Relic Navigator to give you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And use the New Relic Lookout to spot entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Provide context for your entities. Add tags to all your entities. Or create tags for teams and all the services they monitor. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. See how each part of your system is connected. Service maps illustrate your upstream and downstream dependencies. Visualize the aggregated health and activity data from all you monitor. Group and monitor any entities together into functional team-focused, project-focused groupings, or any other attribute, with workloads. Fetch and analyze specific data. Get more context while you query with the query builder, which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Find a service or dashboard in a complex environment. Search by name across all accounts in the unified search, or filter the explorer by tags or text. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. View a list of all the dependencies for a service. The dependencies view tab in an entity summary shows all the dependencies of the entity you’re viewing. Track activity as it moves across your distributed system. Distributed tracing helps you analyze your modern environment. Understand how everything is connected via API. The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer manages all your entities, tags, and relationships. Query your data more easily On the Browse data menu on the top navigation menu you can easily access your basic telemetry data (metrics, events, logs, and traces). Wherever you go in the UI, Query your data is available. No matter your level of proficiency with our query language, you can create custom queries and charts: Browse your data in a query-less experience with our data explorer. Use your NRQL (our query language) expertise to build custom charts in the query builder. Run PromQL-style queries in the query builder. one.newrelic.com > Query your data: Build NRQL and PROMQL-like queries. Enhanced dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Quickly create information dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One. New Relic One dashboards let you build better visualizations more easily, with more options to customize. Dashboard features include: Perform NRQL queries and create charts and dashboards everywhere in the platform using the query builder. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our agents, integrations, and APIs. Share dashboards or charts as a .pdf, or embed a chart in an external site. Tip If you previously used New Relic Insights to create dashboards, these are available as New Relic One dashboards. Build on New Relic One If custom charts and dashboards don't solve your current challenge, we give you a framework for building React JavaScript applications that: Live on New Relic One, alongside your other New Relic-monitored data. Feature highly tailored visualizations. Display data from any source you want, whether from a New Relic-monitored entity or data from any service or API. And you can use open source apps built by the community, and contribute your own open source apps. To learn more, see New Relic One applications. What’s next? To get started understanding how to get around in New Relic One: See what data you have available with the data explorer. Browse your monitored entities with the New Relic Explorer. Use our NerdGraph API to add tags to your data. Learn about dashboards.",

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: allows you to configure your Nerdlet and write to your Nerdlet's URL state.",

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Incident Intelligence events One billing factor is how many incident events your organization sends to Incident Intelligence for correlation and analysis. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, Incident Intelligence comes with a certain number of free incident events per month. (Our original pricing plan doesn't have a free tier.) You can track usage and cost in two places in the UI: In the usage UI From the Incident Intelligence system settings UI page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, then click Incident Intelligence, and then click System settings. Determine event source When you set up Incident Intelligence data sources, the incident events ingested by those sources are what count towards your total. To see the sources affecting your billing, go to the Sources page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, click Incident Intelligence, and then click Sources. Stop reporting events Go to the Incident Intelligence Sources UI page and disconnect all the sources you don’t want. If all sources are removed, no data is sent to Incident Intelligence. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing.

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span.",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Incident Intelligence events One billing factor is how many incident events your organization sends to Incident Intelligence for correlation and analysis. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, Incident Intelligence comes with a certain number of free incident events per month. (Our original pricing plan doesn't have a free tier.) You can track usage and cost in two places in the UI: In the usage UI From the Incident Intelligence system settings UI page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, then click Incident Intelligence, and then click System settings. Determine event source When you set up Incident Intelligence data sources, the incident events ingested by those sources are what count towards your total. To see the sources affecting your billing, go to the Sources page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, click Incident Intelligence, and then click Sources. Stop reporting events Go to the Incident Intelligence Sources UI page and disconnect all the sources you don’t want. If all sources are removed, no data is sent to Incident Intelligence. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Tip Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Incident Intelligence events One billing factor is how many incident events your organization sends to Incident Intelligence for correlation and analysis. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, Incident Intelligence comes with a certain number of free incident events per month. (Our original pricing plan doesn't have a free tier.) You can track usage and cost in two places in the UI: In the usage UI From the Incident Intelligence system settings UI page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, then click Incident Intelligence, and then click System settings. Determine event source When you set up Incident Intelligence data sources, the incident events ingested by those sources are what count towards your total. To see the sources affecting your billing, go to the Sources page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, click Incident Intelligence, and then click Sources. Stop reporting events Go to the Incident Intelligence Sources UI page and disconnect all the sources you don’t want. If all sources are removed, no data is sent to Incident Intelligence. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span.",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "To view workloads, go to one.newrelic.com and find them on the Explorer. There are two main tabs, Health and Activity, plus the header. The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload.

Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

Quickly understand context We provide multiple ways to understand your system's dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems. New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity! If you want to... Use this Have an overall view of your system, and drill down to get performance details. Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the entities (that is, all applications, services, hosts, or containers) in your system. Gain extensive visibility into each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected. Use the New Relic Navigator to give you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And use the New Relic Lookout to spot entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Provide context for your entities. Add tags to all your entities. Or create tags for teams and all the services they monitor. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. See how each part of your system is connected. Service maps illustrate your upstream and downstream dependencies. Visualize the aggregated health and activity data from all you monitor. Group and monitor any entities together into functional team-focused, project-focused groupings, or any other attribute, with workloads. Fetch and analyze specific data. Get more context while you query with the query builder, which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Find a service or dashboard in a complex environment. Search by name across all accounts in the unified search, or filter the explorer by tags or text. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. View a list of all the dependencies for a service. The dependencies view tab in an entity summary shows all the dependencies of the entity you’re viewing. Track activity as it moves across your distributed system. Distributed tracing helps you analyze your modern environment. Understand how everything is connected via API. The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer manages all your entities, tags, and relationships. Query your data more easily On the Browse data menu on the top navigation menu you can easily access your basic telemetry data (metrics, events, logs, and traces). Wherever you go in the UI, Query your data is available. No matter your level of proficiency with our query language, you can create custom queries and charts: Browse your data in a query-less experience with our data explorer. Use your NRQL (our query language) expertise to build custom charts in the query builder.

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Incident Intelligence events One billing factor is how many incident events your organization sends to Incident Intelligence for correlation and analysis. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, Incident Intelligence comes with a certain number of free incident events per month. (Our original pricing plan doesn't have a free tier.) You can track usage and cost in two places in the UI: In the usage UI From the Incident Intelligence system settings UI page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, then click Incident Intelligence, and then click System settings. Determine event source When you set up Incident Intelligence data sources, the incident events ingested by those sources are what count towards your total. To see the sources affecting your billing, go to the Sources page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, click Incident Intelligence, and then click Sources. Stop reporting events Go to the Incident Intelligence Sources UI page and disconnect all the sources you don’t want. If all sources are removed, no data is sent to Incident Intelligence. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span.",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Incident Intelligence events One billing factor is how many incident events your organization sends to Incident Intelligence for correlation and analysis. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, Incident Intelligence comes with a certain number of free incident events per month. (Our original pricing plan doesn't have a free tier.) You can track usage and cost in two places in the UI: In the usage UI From the Incident Intelligence system settings UI page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, then click Incident Intelligence, and then click System settings. Determine event source When you set up Incident Intelligence data sources, the incident events ingested by those sources are what count towards your total. To see the sources affecting your billing, go to the Sources page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, click Incident Intelligence, and then click Sources. Stop reporting events Go to the Incident Intelligence Sources UI page and disconnect all the sources you don’t want. If all sources are removed, no data is sent to Incident Intelligence. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span.",

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020 and haven't migrated your users to the new model, your users are on our original user model (and not the New Relic One model). If you're an admin and want to see if you have users on the original model: If you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Updates about our new user model In July of 2020, we released a new user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more older customers to the new model. Some older customers are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this: Click the account dropdown, click Account settings, and then click Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) and full user upgrades Note that billing-related aspects of your count of full users only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. To control how basic users upgrade to become full users, from the Users and roles UI you can select Access requests. You have two options: Automatic approval: With this option, basic users can automatically upgrade to be full users. This option allows your users to more easily troubleshoot problems. Require review: With this option, your admins get a notification when basic users request an upgrade and must upgrade them first. You can approve them either from the notification email or from the user's entry in the Users and roles UI. For more about user type, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to our more curated observability UI experiences (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Depending on access request settings, basic users can either upgrade themselves to be full users or request upgrade access from admins. Full user. Details: Full users have access to everything (dependent on role restrictions), which includes our curated observability UI experiences, such as APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user is considered a full user and has full user access on all accounts in that organization. For how to edit a user's type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of user permissions. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads.

If the Diagnostics CLI detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. The Diagnostics CLI can automatically upload troubleshooting data to a New Relic account. The Diagnostics CLI is open source and is located in GitHub. For additional troubleshooting steps for your agent, check out Not seeing data. Here's an example of the Diagnostics CLI running on Ubuntu Linux. The program checks your New Relic agent configurations for issues and generates zipped troubleshooting logs that are ready to be attached to support tickets. Compatibility The Diagnostics CLI is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. It can detect common configuration issues for: APM: Available for all APM agents except C SDK. For the Go agent, only basic connectivity checks are available. Browser monitoring: Browser agent detection Infrastructure monitoring: Linux and Windows agents Mobile agents: iOS and Android Synthetic monitoring: Containerized private minions (CPM) The Diagnostics CLI does not require superuser or admin permissions to run, although we recommend those permissions for some checks. It will return an error if it does not have permissions to read the files it scans. Get started To use the Diagnostics CLI: Run the Diagnostics CLI, including task suites and command line options as needed. Supply the -attach flag for uploading results to your New Relic account.

      "body": "Important New Relic provides limited technical support for customers using .NET Framework 4.0 or earlier. This level of support includes ensuring that the following areas are configured as expected: Agent configuration System settings Network access Permissions settings You can perform most troubleshooting checks by using New Relic Diagnostics, with the exception of a few checks that must be done manually. If a New Relic Diagnostics check does find an issue, information on additional troubleshooting and potential resolutions will appear in your terminal. Agent version requirements To get the most out of your New Relic .NET Framework agent, make sure you follow New Relic's compatibility and requirements guidelines. Important Applications running on .NET Framework version 4.0 or lower require a New Relic .NET agent version lower than 7.0. Download and run the appropriate install package for your architecture: 32-bit installer 64-bit installer Agent configuration Limited technical support to troubleshoot your basic installation and configuration includes: Check if the .NET agent is present and has valid configuration files. If the agent is installed, check for the agent's core .dll. If the config file is valid, check for expected elements. For example, include a manual check that it conforms to the standards laid out in the .xsd. Instrumentation Limited technical support to troubleshoot if instrumentation is possible includes: Check if WAS registry keys and required values are present and valid. Check W3SVC registry keys and required values are present and valid. Check ENV (non-IIS/global environment variables) reg keys and required values are present and valid. Verify if instrumentation is possible by using these key checks to determine what types of apps can be monitored. Confirm that the process has the necessary environment variables loaded. For example, use a tool such as the Microsoft Sysinternals Process Explorer. Web app Some checks require elevated permissions. For best results, run New Relic Diagnostics from an admin shell. Limited technical support to troubleshoot running web apps with the .NET agent installed includes: Check for any running W3WP processes, and get their pid. Check for key .dll required for instrumentation. For example, if there are any W3WP processes, check if the New Relic profiler .dll and mscorelib.dll are loaded into the process. Applications not hosted on IIS [#non-IIS apps] Limited technical support to troubleshoot apps not hosted on IIS includes: When using the MSI, ensure the Instrument all option has been enabled. Check that the custom instrumentation file has been created, is in the proper place, and is accurate. If applicable, include a manual check that it conforms to the standards laid out in the .xsd. Network access and permissions Limited technical support to troubleshoot system network access and permissions applies to any agent version, and includes: Check system network access and permissions. Run collector tests. For example, check whether the URL https://collector.newrelic.com/status/mongrel is up and the server can connect to it. Check whether the config file contains any proxy settings, if proxy info has been passed to New Relic Diagnostics, and if these settings allow for connection to New Relic collectors. Check if New Relic Diagnostics is running as admin. New Relic Diagnostics must run as admin to help ensure accuracy of some other tests. Also, admin rights are required to install the .NET agent. Agent logs Limited technical support to troubleshoot information available from .NET agent logs includes: Gather any available agent logs. Check the log level. Check for known issues noted in the logs. Troubleshooting log files may require you to work directly with New Relic Support. Framework version Limited technical support depends on which .NET agent version you are using. New Relic Support will check what framework versions of the .NET agent are installed on the system. Full URL in OpenRasta requests When using OpenRasta instrumentation, the full URL may be captured on instrumented requests. This may result in query strings being collected that may contain sensitive information. See security bulletin NR19-01.",

Account access If you're having trouble finding an account, here are some causes and solutions: If your organization has multiple accounts and you have access to those accounts, you will see an account switcher at the top left of most New Relic UI pages that will let you switch between accounts. If you're logged into New Relic but can't find an account or its data, it may be for one of these reasons: You may need to be added to that account. How you do this will depend on your user model: Original use model | New Relic One user model. You may have more than one New Relic login associated with the same email address. If you think this may be the case, log out and log back in. When you input your email address, the login UI notes if you have multiple user records and gives you an option for verifying your email to see all available accounts when you log in. Other details about multiple logins: To see all your available login options the next time you log in, select Remember me when logging in. If one of your login options reads \"Original account\", that means it's a user record on our original user model. For more information, see this Explorers Hub post about multiple accounts.

Pricing plans: Our original product-based pricing plan: This plan separates our offerings by product. If you’re on this plan, access to some features may depend on the products you pay for. Our New Relic One pricing plan: This newer pricing plan gives more cross-platform access. The main factors affecting access are your edition and your user type. We also have several pricing editions: Standard, Pro, and Enterprise. Learn more about our pricing plans. The entities being monitored Some of our solutions enable functionality that isn’t available to all users, like: Additional UI components, and Data available for querying For example, enabling distributed tracing results in you seeing trace data in the UI and in having trace data available for querying.

      "body": "This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). If the name begins with anything other than an alphabetical character, enclose the name with backticks in your NRQL query. For example: FROM `0_hello` SELECT count(*) Copy Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",

      "body": "What is MLOps? MLOps stands for machine-learning operations. As more companies invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, there's a gap in understanding between the data science teams developing machine-learning models and the DevOps teams operating the applications that power those models. MLOps provides a tool for monitoring and observing the performance and effectiveness of machine-learning models in a production environment. This increases the possibilities for collaboration between data science and DevOps teams, feeding into a continuous process of development, testing, and operational monitoring. The DagsHub integration DagsHub is a platform for data scientists and machine learning engineers to version and sync their data, models, experiments, and code. It allows you and your team to easily share, review and reuse your work, providing a GitHub-like experience for machine learning. DagsHub is built on popular open-source tools and formats, making it easy to integrate with the tools you already use like New Relic. New Relic now offers an integration with DagsHub to monitor and analyze your machine learning training metrics in real-time. Integrate DagsHub with New Relic Integrating DagsHub and New Relic enables you to analyze and monitor machine learning training metrics in real-time. You can visualize your metrics in a New Relic dashboard, create custom metrics, and set alerts to notify you of events and incidents happening during your training runs. In order to receive data from DagsHub into New Relic, you need your account number and a special key which you can obtain as follows: Log into your New Relic account: Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Explorer. On the upper hand right corner, on the main navigation menu, click on +Add more data. Click on DagsHub: Type DagsHub in the search bar, or scroll down to the MLOps Integration section, and click the DagsHub icon. Select the account ID you want DagsHub to integrate with. Create an access token: Once you've selected an account ID, under real-time insert metrics, click Create an API key . This will be your new telemetry API key. Keep the New Relic page open for future steps. Log into the DagsHub portal and select the repository you're working on. Click Settings, and select the integrations button from the left hand menu. Click on the New Relic tile. Copy and paste the token in DagsHub. Go back to the New Relic integration dashboard and copy the token you created by clicking on the copy icon next to the insert key. On the DagsHub’s portal, paste the insert key under New Relic Insight insert key, and finish by clicking Next. The token will be verified, and a confirmation screen will appear. View and explore your DagsHub models in New Relic dashboards Once you configure the New Relic integration in DagsHub, all the training metrics logged to DagsHub in real time are sent to New Relic. Go to the DagsHub integration dashboard: Once you’ve tested your tokens and confirmed the integration is set up correctly, return to the New Relic integration dashboard and click on See your data. You will be redirected to an automatically generated New Relic dashboard powered by DagsHub. Analyze the DagsHub dashboard: The DagsHub dashboard contains one chart, Loss metric by repository, which displays the loss of your models, grouped by their respective repository. It works for any models that you have trained. Display customized metrics: You can easily customize training metrics coming from DagsHub. For more information on using NRQL and creating queries to track your data, refer to NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. Set up alerts notifications: Once you've created some dashboards, you can get alerted on your data. To create NRQL alerts conditions from a chart, click the ... chart menu, then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy, or create a new one. Get notified: Once you've created an alerts condition, you can choose how you want to be notified. See our docs on how to set up notification channels. You’ve now successfully integrated New Relic with DagsHub. Newly created alerts are correlated with your New Relic alerts, and you'll see data about newly reported predictions.",

      "body": "New Relic's Metric API can be used to send metric data to New Relic from a variety of sources. This API is how metrics from some of our integrations and exporters get into New Relic. Want to try out our Metric API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. What is the Metric API? The Metric API is a way to get metric data into New Relic. The API works by sending a POST request to our HTTP endpoint with a JSON payload containing the metric data. The Metric API is how metrics are ingested from some of our integrations, including our open source exporters (like DropWizard, OpenCensus, and Prometheus). The Metric API is also used by our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that make it easier to use our data-ingest APIs. The Metric API can be used to: Report metric data to New Relic without a New Relic agent. Integrate metric data from an open source or in-house developed tool, library, or framework. Fully control the metric data you're sending, including the resolution and associated dimensions. Leverage the power of NRQL, New Relic's query language, for querying your metric data. Set up alerts for your metric data. Requirements Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name metric-api.newrelic.com or metric-api.eu.newrelic.com. You'll need a New Relic license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. For information on limits and restricted attributes, see Metric API requirements and limits. Get started If we don't have an existing integration that meets your metric-reporting needs, you have two options: Use our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that help you send us metrics and other data. Use the Metric API directly. Find and use your data You can find data sent via the Metric API (including from integrations that use this API) in these locations: From one.newrelic.com, select Explorer and look for your service. By querying the Metric data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Metric Copy For more on querying, see Metric query examples. For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Troubleshooting See Troubleshoot an NrIntegrationError event.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! You can use metrics from your New Relic account to autoscale applications and services in your Kubernetes cluster by deploying the New Relic Metrics Adapter. This adapter fetches the metric values from New Relic and makes them available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the external.metrics.k8s.io API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries results. Once deployed, the value for each configured metric is fetched using the NerdGraph API based on the configured NRQL query. The metrics adapter exposes the metrics over a secured endpoint with TLS. New Relic metrics adapter in a cluster. Requirements Kubernetes 1.16 or higher. The New Relic Kubernetes integration. New Relic's user API key. No other External Metrics Adapter installed in the cluster. Installation To install the New Relic Metrics Adapter, we provide the newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter Helm chart, which is also included in the nri-bundle chart used to deploy all New Relic Kubernetes components. Install the New Relic Metrics Adapter by running the following command: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set metrics-adapter.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_PERSONAL_API_KEY \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.accountID=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.external_metric_name.query=NRQL query Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: metrics-adapter.enabled: Must be set to true so the metrics adapter chart is installed. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey: Must be set to valid New Relic Personal API key. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.accountID: Must be set to valid New Relic account where metrics are going to be fetched from. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.<var>external_metric_name</var>.<var>query</var>: Adds a new external metric where: <var>external_metric_name</var>: The metric name. <var>query</var>: The base NRQL query that is used to get the value for the metric. Tip Alternatively, you can use a values.yaml file that can be passed to the helm command with the --values flag. Values files can contain all parameters needed to configure the metrics explained in the configuration section. Configuration You can configure multiple metrics in the metrics adapter and change some parameters to modify the behaviour of the metrics cache and filtering. To see the full list and descriptions of all parameters that can be modified, refer to the chart README.md and values.yaml files. How it works The following values enable the metrics adapter on the nri-bundle chart installation: metrics-adapter: enabled: true newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter: personalAPIKey: <Personal API Key> config: accountID: <Account ID> externalMetrics: nginx_average_requests: query: \"FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO\" Copy Caution The default time span for metrics is 1h. Therefore, you should define queries with the SINCE clause to adjust the time span according to your environment and needs. There is an HPA consuming the external metric as follows: kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 metadata: name: nginx-scaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: External external: metric: name: nginx_average_requests selector: matchLabels: k8s.namespaceName: nginx target: type: Value value: 10000 Copy Based on the HPA definition, the controller manager fetches the metrics from the external metrics API which are served by the New Relic metrics adapter. The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose deafult is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors. The same error message gives you the executed query and position of the error. You can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter. extracting return value: expected first value to be of type \"float64\", got %!q(<nil>): The query doesn't return any value. The same error message gives you the executed query so you can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter or the match selectors in the HPA.",

      "body": "Use our New Relic query language (NRQL) to create alerts conditions with ease. Your condition describes what you want to be notified about, and only requires two attributes: a query and a threshold. The query defines the data that's important to you, and determines what you want to be notified about. The threshold determines when you’ll be notified. Follow these steps to write your first alerts condition using a NRQL query and a threshold. Once you're done, you'll have a working alert condition. Step 1: Write your query You can use a NRQL query to return data about how your environment is performing. Then, you can create a condition from that query. In this example, a condition is created for each host's CPU utilization (query), which will trigger a notification when the CPU utilization is above the 0.7% (threshold). Generally, you won't use thresholds below 1%, but this example simply shows you how to set up a threshold. Find the NRQL query builder at the top of the UI. Click the Query your data button to open the query builder and start writing a NRQL query. Once you've written a valid query, you can create a condition from it. The condition shows each host’s CPU utilization. Use this NRQL query, or something similar that's relevant to what you're monitoring, to create a condition. This query finds the average CPU utilization in an environment and then breaks it down (facets) by individual host names. Once you've created a valid NRQL query, click Create alert. Learn more about the NRQL syntax to create other useful queries. Step 2: Name your NRQL condition Give your NRQL condition a name that's meaningful to you. Step 3: Set your condition thresholds Set critical and warning thresholds to determine when you’re notified about your environment's performance. A critical threshold is required for your alerts condition. A warning threshold is optional. These thresholds don't create an incident or notify you like the critical threshold does. If a critical threshold opens an incident and notifies you, warning threshold violations created afterwards will be included in the report. In this example from the Set your condition thresholds section, our critical threshold (red) checks for any hosts with CPU utilization over 0.7% for at least 5 minutes. A warning threshold (yellow) is also added showing when any host's CPU utilization goes over 0.67% for at least 5 minutes. After you enter threshold values, you can see the threshold lines on the graph: Step 4: Create a policy Finally, add your condition to an existing policy or create a new one. When you create a new policy, you can group your violations by policy, condition, or by violation (this creates an incident for each violation). These incident preferences settings determine how frequently you're notified when there's a violation. What's next? Now that you've created your first condition, set up your incident preferences and notification channels. For a detailed, comprehensive overview of NRQL conditions, see Create NRQL alert conditions",

      "body": "Every time you deploy an application, you hope that it's efficient and error-free. The reality, however, is usually quite different. You might introduce a bug in a release, overlook an edge case, or rely on a broken dependency. These issues, and others, can result in bad user experiences. In this guide, you: Use the open-source New Relic demo-deployer to spin up the infrastructure for Acme Telco Lite, a fictional company. This demo scenario is part of our Demo Catalog and will simulate real-world issues in a controlled, demo environment Use New Relic to understand those issues from the perspective of a Telco Lite developer Use the deployer to tear down the resources you create Welcome to Acme Telco Lite! Acme Telco Lite is a mock telecom business that maintains an eCommerce website for its customers. The site's architecture has eight, interconnected microservices, plus a simulator: The simulator isn't part of the Telco Lite infrastructure, but it is part of the demo deployment. It runs scenarios against the application to create web traffic and generate interesting data in New Relic. Set up your environment Before you begin, follow the Prerequisites guide from the deployer's GitHub repository for a detailed walkthrough of how to set up your environment. For this guide, you can choose between Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host your deployment. The guide steps you through: Installing Docker & pulling the demo-deployer image locally Creating a user config file containing credentials for New Relic and your cloud provider Downloading a .pem key file (if your cloud provider is AWS) Once you're all set up, deploy Acme Telco Lite. Deploy Telco Lite It's time to deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services using demo-deployer. Copy the url for the demo that corresponds to the cloud provider you chose when you set up your environment: AWS Telco Lite Demo Azure Telco Lite Demo GCP Telco Lite Demo Follow the Deployment guide in the Demo Catalog repository for a thorough explanation of how to use the deployer in a local Docker environment. When you run the deployment script, make sure to pass the url you copied for <demo-url>. Tip Since Telco Lite contains several services, the deployment can take over half an hour. When the deloyer is finished, you should see some output stating that the deployment was successful: bash Copy [INFO] Executing Deployment [✔] Parsing and validating Deployment configuration success [✔] Provisioner success [✔] Installing On-Host instrumentation success [✔] Installing Services and instrumentations success [INFO] Deployment successful!

View your services With your services running in the cloud, log in to New Relic and select APM from the top navigation to see how your services are holding up: Yikes! The alerts, high response times, and red-colored indicators suggest things aren't well. Use New Relic to diagnose these issues, which are simultaneously affecting your services: Issue 1: The Warehouse Portal has abnormally high response times Issue 2: Multiple services are raising error alerts Tip Don't worry if you don't see all the same alerts. The simulator triggers issues at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. Tear down Telco Lite When you're finished diagnosing all the issues effecting Telco Lite, follow the Teardown guide in the deployer's repository to tear down the services you created in your cloud provider. If you're still exploring, don't tear down your services, or you'll have to deploy them again later. Conclusion Congratulations, you're done! Throughout this tutorial, you: Used the demo-deployer to deploy Telco Lite to the cloud Used New Relic to investigate simulated issues in Telco Lite services Tore down all the infrastructural resources you created throughout this tutorial Hopefully, you learned a lot about using New Relic to investigate issues in your services. To get your hands on more features of New Relic, pick another demo from the catalog and spin it up with the deployer!",

      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why Telco-Warehouse Portal has slower-than-normal response times. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the high response times in your services. Step 1 of 6 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that the response time for Telco-Warehouse Portal is 43 seconds, much higher than the response times in other services: On the APM page, select the Telco-Warehouse Portal service name to see a summary of that service. The top graph in the summary view shows Web transactions time: You see several peaks, reaching almost 50,000 milliseconds—or 50 seconds! From this graph, you can actually gain a little more insight by toggling the colored components beneath the graph. For example, select Node.js: The graph changes to show only what the Node.js component contributes to the overall response time—less than 100 ms, in this example. Now, select Web external and deselect Node.js: External web traffic is the primary contributor to the high response times. That's a good start, but it doesn't tell the whole story. Next, dive deeper to find out which external service is causing the issue. Step 2 of 6 So, you know that Web external is the culprit of the high response times, but it's hard to tell why. External web traffic is all the requests made from your service to other services. This means you should look into what external requests that the warehouse portal makes to try to understand exactly what external service is the bottleneck. From the left-hand navigation, select Monitor > Distributed tracing: This view shows you requests to the warehouse portal. Select a request from the table at the bottom of the view to see a trace through that request: This trace shows that one external request contributes almost all of the total trace duration. Specifically, an external request to the Telco-Fulfillment Service contributes over 99% of the overall response time. This is good news! You own the fulfillment service, which means you can drill down for even more information. Select the offending row (called a span), and then select Explore this transaction: Step 3 of 6 You're now looking at the __main__:inventory_item transaction overview. Because you know that some part of this transaction is slow, you can use this overview to narrow your focus even further. Similar to how you modified the warehouse portal APM graph, you can look specifically at the components of this transaction to understand where the root cause of the slowness is. Another way to view this information is to scroll down to the Breakdown table in that same view: Function/__main__:inventory_item, a Python function, contributes over 99% of the overall response time. At this point, you know that Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow. You also know that the issue in the fulfillment service is local because over 99% of the request is spent in Python code, not external services. Navigate to the fulfillment service's summary page to look at the service as a whole, instead of this single transaction: Step 4 of 6 Scroll down on this view to familiarize yourself with the graphs it shows, such as Throughput and Error rate. At the bottom of the page, you can see a table with the fulfillment hosts. You can't currently drill into a specific host in the new UI (we're working on it), but you can in the old UI. Toggle Show new view to off and select the host link: Step 5 of 6 Now, you're looking at graphs in the infrastructure view for that service's host. Notice that CPU % has a lot of high spikes. Click and drag on the graph from the start of a spike to the end of it to narrow the timeslice to the period when CPU utilization goes up: If you compare this graph to the fulfillment service's transaction graph you looked at earlier, you'll see that soon after __main__:inventory_item begins executing, the CPU utilization of the host sharply rises to 100%! Step 6 of 6 Now, you understand the problem causing slow response times in the warehouse portal, but you don't know the extent of the issue. Using service maps, you can see all your services that depend on the fullfillment service. Navigate to the service map under APM > Telco-Fulfillment Service: This map shows you the fulfillment service's incoming and outgoing dependencies. Not only is Telco-Warehouse Portal dependent on the fullfillment service, but so is Telco-Web Portal! Select the web portal node to see that the fulfillment service also affects the web portal's response times: Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow The fulfillment service's Python function contributes over 99% of the response time Soon after the Python function starts executing, the host's CPU utilization spikes up to 100% The fulfillment service also affects Telco-Web Portal response times Now, as the developer behind the fulfillment service, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the CPU spikes. Congratulations! You can learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, you can tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABlE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "With the data explorer you can navigate all your data visually, without any NRQL knowledge. Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces query interfaces to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From the data explorer you can access the query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

In addition to instrumenting your web frameworks, you can also instrument calls to and from messaging systems, database calls, and external calls! By passing context about your code to the APIs, you will get the same reporting, including cross application tracing, that you get with New Relic’s built-in instrumentation. Solr This release adds support for Solr versions 5 and 6 (up to and including version 6.3.0). Fixes Fixes a bug that prevents an application from starting up when a JAX-RS annotated method contains more than 8 parameters. Fixes an issue that affected Spring and JAX-RS applications compiled with the Java 8 flag javac -parameters. The issue would cause the application to throw a java.lang.reflect.MalformedParametersException exception. Fixes bug that affected applications implementing JAX-RS endpoints using static methods. The agent now reports WildFly dispatcher name and version. Fixes a bug in which Queue Time could be misreported on the Overview page for customers injecting the X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start HTTP headers. This fix brings the Java Agent into compliance with the behavior of other New Relic Agents. Fixes an issue in which custom Hystrix Commands that are subclassed multiple times in Groovy cause an application to throw an exception on startup.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize NRQL data, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { this[index] = { endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, } }, data ) historicalData.data = data return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data, format it according to the TableChart specifications, and set it on historicalData.data. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet.",

      "body": "Syntax newrelic.agent.function_trace(name=None, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Copy Used to instrument functions, methods, generators, and coroutines that aren't instrumented by default. Description function_trace is a decorator for adding to functions, methods, generators, and coroutines. Adding this decorator lets you collect additional transaction information (including transaction trace information). (An alternate way to instrument functions without having to touch your app code is to list them in the config file.) function_trace does not give you a full profile of all the functions that happen in a decorated function. What it does is add the decorated function as a node in the New Relic UI and capture the time spent in that function. If you need more detail about what is going on in that function, you would need to also apply the function trace to the function's child functions. The function_trace decorator can be used on generators and coroutines with agent version 2.102.0.85 or higher. Timing of these objects begins when consumption starts, and ends when the object is exhausted or goes out of scope. This is a change from earlier versions where the metric represented the time taken to create the generator or coroutine object itself. You can use the decorator in conjunction with existing decorators, including those for static and class methods. When nesting multiple decorators, have the function_trace decorator as the outermost decorator. Important For any decorators that are being wrapped, use functools.wraps() from the Python standard library in their implementation. (Or, otherwise ensure that the decorator propagates the correct name attributes of the innermost wrapped object required to allow correct name introspection.) If this is not done, then when the metric is reported, the name of the nested decorator function (not the innermost wrapped function) will be used. Alternate call forms For setups where you cannot use the decorator, these alternate call forms are available: The context manager The FunctionTrace context manager is used when the parameters to be passed cannot be determined before runtime. (For example, you may not know the name of a function at import time.) When using the context manager to name a metric, you must always supply the name and the metric path prefix. The FunctionTrace class implements the context manager and is used in conjunction with the with statement. The FunctionTrace class is the lowest level primitive available for tracing time against a transaction. The with statement defines the bounds of what is timed and not a single function. Thus, the context manager could be applied to an arbitrary block of code. The block of code could therefore contain calls to multiple functions, or it could be a self-contained block of code implementing a time-oriented algorithm that you want to track. Important Avoid tracing blocks of code that are called an excessive number of times. For example, do not use it within the context of a loop that executes many times. The data generated will incur a performance overhead. A better solution is to enclose the loop. The wrapper If you know in advance where the specific functions you want to trace are, you could use the function_trace decorator. However, if you don't know all the functions that need to be traced (for example, if they're being looked up dynamically as part of a routing system), then you must use the FunctionTraceWrapper to wrap the function at the time of registration or at the time of calling. Path-based wrapping wrap_function_trace is used for wrapping functions outside of the code they're declared in. For example: you might use this to instrument library code that you don't want to modify. For more about the differences between these call formats, see Different call formats. Parameters Parameters for decorator newrelic.agent.function_trace(name=None, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Copy This call includes these parameters: Parameter Description name string Optional. The function name. If not set, defaults to the captured name of the function. group string Optional. The group represents the naming structure for the name parameter. This is used in the UI for segregating the transaction types. If not supplied, the group will default to Function in expectation that the name is of the form module:class.function or module:function and represents the name of the function being executed. If you are creating a custom group, it's recommended you prefix it with Python/. label string Optional. Adds a callout-style flag to the segment in a transaction trace. Default is None. params dict Optional. Custom parameters to add to the segment in transaction traces. terminal boolean Optional. If true, no children segments will be recorded. Default is False. Parameters for context manager newrelic.agent.FunctionTrace(name, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Copy Parameters for the context manager includes all of the parameters from function_trace. The name parameter is required and not optional. Parameter Description name string Required. The function name. Wrapper parameters newrelic.agent.FunctionTraceWrapper(wrapped, name=None, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Copy Parameters for the wrapper include all parameters for function_trace and a wrapped parameter: Parameter Description wrapped function Required. The function being wrapped. Path-based wrapping parameters newrelic.agent.wrap_function_trace(module, object_path, name=None, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Copy Parameters include all parameters for function_trace and these parameters: Parameter Description module object Required. The module containing the function to be instrumented. object_path string The path to the location of the function. Examples function_trace example An example of using the function_trace decorator: import newrelic.agent class _Database(UserDict.DictMixin): ... @newrelic.agent.function_trace() def _commit(self): ... @newrelic.agent.function_trace() def open(file, flag=None, mode=0666): ... Copy An example of using the function_trace decorator with native coroutines: import newrelic.agent class _Database(UserDict.DictMixin): ... @newrelic.agent.function_trace() async def _commit(self): ... @newrelic.agent.function_trace() async def open(file, flag=None, mode=0666): ... Copy Context manager example An example of using the FunctionTrace context manager: import newrelic.agent def dispatch_request(self, request): adapter = self.url_map.bind_to_environ(request.environ) try: endpoint, values = adapter.match() function = getattr(self, 'on_' + endpoint) with newrelic.agent.FunctionTrace( endpoint, 'Python/EndPoint'): return function(request, **values) except HTTPException as e: return e Copy Wrapper example An example of using the FunctionTraceWrapper: URL routing with Werkzeug yields a name that is used first to dynamically look up a method of a class using getattr() and the result then invoked: def dispatch_request(self, request): adapter = self.url_map.bind_to_environ(request.environ) try: endpoint, values = adapter.match() return getattr(self, 'on_' + endpoint)(request, **values) except HTTPException as e: return e Copy If you want to trace the endpoint function, you can rewrite this as: import newrelic.agent def dispatch_request(self, request): adapter = self.url_map.bind_to_environ(request.environ) try: endpoint, values = adapter.match() function = getattr(self, 'on_' + endpoint) function = newrelic.agent.FunctionTraceWrapper(function) return function(request, **values) except HTTPException as e: return e Copy If you want to name the metric after the endpoint name (rather than naming the metric based on the identifier for the function being called), you can supply the name to use plus an alternate metric path prefix when the FunctionTraceWrapper object is created. import newrelic.agent def dispatch_request(self, request): adapter = self.url_map.bind_to_environ(request.environ) try: endpoint, values = adapter.match() function = getattr(self, 'on_' + endpoint) function = newrelic.agent.FunctionTraceWrapper( function, name=endpoint, group='Python/EndPoint') return function(request, **values) except HTTPException as e: return e Copy For this example, if the endpoint were called help, the final metric would be: Python/EndPoint/help Copy In the performance breakdown for a transaction, the category would be Python and the segment name EndPoint/help. That segment name would also appear in slow transaction traces as the node name.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorage from your nerdlet, before starting this one. Throughout this course, you're building a New Relic One application that gathers telemetry data from a demo web service that's running an A/B test on a newsletter signup form. The purpose of your New Relic One application is to help you understand how design changes impact the number of high quality newsletter subscriptions your service gets. The business objective, to increase your service's high quality newsletter subscriptions, relies primarily on three key pieces of information: Number of page views per version Number of subscriptions per version Number of cancellations Cancellations are important because if one design version of your newsletter signup form results in a high number of subscriptions but also a high number of cancellations, then those subscriptions are not as valuable. In previous lessons, you gathered data for page views and subscriptions from New Relic's database (NRDB), but you still need cancellation data. Your demo application does not report cancellation data to New Relic, so you need to fetch that data from an external source. We've provided a service at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations to return fake cancellation data for the purposes of this course. If you visit this URL in your browser, you'll see a brief message: \"Unauthorized\". This is because we created this service with a requirement that whoever requests its data must pass an Authorization header with the bearer token ABC123. So before you can request cancellation data from api.nerdsletter.net, you need to implement a few new behaviors in your application: Provide a mechanism for inputting an authorization token Persist the authorization token in a secure data store To input your authorization token, you'll use a Modal with a TextField. The secure data store you'll use is called NerdStorageVault. It's different from NerdStorage, which you used in the last lesson, because it only supports user storage and encrypts its data. Store your API token Step 1 of 3 Change to the add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 3 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, initialize state in AbTestNerdletNerdlet with a null token default: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Your Nerdlet uses this token state to manage the authorization token you'll later pass to the third-party service. However, a component's state is not a long-term solution for data management. For that, you need NerdStorageVault. Step 3 of 3 Implement a method, called storeToken(), which mutates NerdStorageVault data, and bind that method to the AbTestNerdletNerdlet instance: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy When you call storeToken() with a new token value, your Nerdlet uses NerdGraph APIs to mutate NerdStorageVault data for the api_token key. If the request to NerdGraph is successful, storeToken() updates state.token so that the new token is locally accessible. Unlike NerdStorage, which has query and mutation components for your convenience, NerdStorageVault has no components in the SDK. Instead, you have to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to interact with it Important It's important to remember that NerdStorageVault is limited to the user scope. Any other users of your New Relic One application will have their own NerdStorageVault data. This means that even other users on your account will need to enter their token separately. Query your API token Step 1 of 2 First, create methods and state to show and hide your API token prompt: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy state.hideTokenPrompt determines whether or not the prompt is visible. Now, you need a mechanism for revealing the prompt, which is hidden by default. Step 2 of 2 Query NerdStorageVault for your api_token: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, in componentDidMount(), you've queried NerdGraph for your api_token data. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that's called when your component is mounted in the component tree. This means that early in it's setup process, your application will request your api_token. If the NerdGraph query responds successfully with your token from NerdStorageVault, it sets the token in state. Otherwise, it shows the prompt so that you can enter a token. This is great for storing an initial token, but what if you enter the wrong token or the API changes? You need a way reveal the prompt on-demand. Next, you'll create the actual token prompt and a button to manually invoke the prompt. Create your token prompt Step 1 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named token-prompt.js: bash Copy $ touch token-prompt.js Step 2 of 9 In this new file, create a button that allows you to enter a new token on demand: import React from 'react'; import { Button } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenButton receives showPrompt() in its props and calls that method when its Button is clicked. Step 3 of 9 Create a token prompt using a Modal with a TextField: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenPrompt renders a Modal with a TextField, a Button, and an explanatory prompt. You use the Modal to enter your API token. It also provides basic error handling if you try to submit the form with no token value. It's important to distinguish the token in AbTestNerdletNerdlet.state and the token in ApiTokenPrompt.state. The token in your Nerdlet's state is the current token that your Nerdlet knows about. It's this token that matches what's in NerdStorageVault. The token in ApiTokenPrompt.state is a fluid value that changes as you update the text in the TextField. When you press Submit in the modal, ApiTokenPrompt submits its token to your Nerdlet's storeToken() method. Then, storeToken() mutates NerdStorageVault with the new token. You also implemented a few methods to improve the user experience: keyPress() submits the token when the RETURN key is pressed showTokenError() and hideTokenError() remind the user that they must enter a token before submitting the form Step 4 of 9 Export your components, so you can use them in your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } export { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import ApiTokenButton and ApiTokenPrompt and add them to render(): import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; import { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } from './token-prompt'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you visit your application for the first time, the prompt is automatically revealed. Enter \"ABC123\" in the TextField, as that's the token that the third-party service expects. Once you submit your token and your Nerdlet hides the prompt, click Update API token at the bottom of your New Relic One application to reveal it again: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Pass your API token to TotalCancellations Step 1 of 3 In index.js, pass the API token to TotalCancellations so you're prepared to make a request to the third-party service: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests';

} } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <TotalCancellations token={this.state.token} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 2 of 3 In total-cancellations.js, log the token to your browser console: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { lastToken: null } } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) this.setState({lastToken: this.props.token}) } } render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy Here, you've implemented another React lifecycle method, called componentDidUpdate(). Now, every time your Nerdlet's state.token changes, TotalCancellations gets a new token prop, which triggers componentDidUpdate(). In componentDidUpdate(), you check that the incoming token is not the same as the last token it knew about, which is stored in local state. If the incoming token is different, you log a message with the new token and update state.lastToken. This logic prepares your code for a future change to use your API token in a request to a third-party service. Step 3 of 3 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see the log from TotalCancellations in your browser's console: If you change your token, you'll see another log from TotalCancellations with your updated token. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now you know how to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to manage data in NerdStorageVault! Remember, use NerdStorage for your New Relic One application's non-sensitive data and NerdStorageVault for the sensitive stuff like tokens, passwords, and other secrets. As a bonus, you created a way to manage your token in NerdStorageVault from the user interface. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component for later use. Whether it's been with NrqlQuery, AccountStorageQuery, AccountStorageMutation, NerdGraphQuery, or NerdGraphMutation, you've learned several ways to interact with New Relic data in your New Relic One application. But New Relic One applications aren't just another way to show New Relic data. The purpose of New Relic One applications is to show you how your software is helping you meet your business objectives. Sometimes, New Relic data is all you need to make that happen, but other times you need to look beyond New Relic for data to fill in the gaps. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Fetch data from a third-party service.",

      "body": "You can generate metric-type data from other types of data in New Relic, including events, logs, and spans. Metrics are aggregates of your data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods. This document explains: Reasons to use this feature Available operations How to use our NerdGraph API tool to perform operations Why create metrics from other data types? Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage. This in turn allows you to query your data and build charts more easily. The difference between metrics and other types of data in New Relic is based on time. For more information, see Understand data types. Events, logs, spans: These types of data represent a single record at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your events, logs, or spans. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you can aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this information month over month. Why use metrics? Comments Flexibility Metrics are dimensional. You can choose what metadata (like host name or app name) is attached to them. Common metric measurements, like average, sum, minimum, and maximum, are already calculated. Data aggregation and retention The data has already been pre-aggregated into longer-period time buckets. Data retention is 13 months. Query capabilities You can query using the Metric data type. When you create metrics, this does not delete your events or other types of data. However, metrics are better for longer-range querying and charting. To get started converting your data to metrics, create a rule. Available operations To show, create, and delete rules for generating metrics from events, logs, or spans, use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. These operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing metrics rules). All operations are role-based in NerdGraph as the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics include: Create a rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule The method being called to delete a rule. deletes This takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Example response for the request: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsDeleteRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"id\": \"12\", \"name\": \"Test Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } Copy Enable or disable a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To enable or disable an existing rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics, use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation. The only difference is whether enabled is set to true or false. Example request to enable an existing metrics rule: mutation { eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsUpdateRule The method being called to update an existing rule and either enable it or disable it. updates This takes three required parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. enabled: To enable a disabled rule, set this to true. To disable a rule, set this to false. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Queries Query operations include: List all rules for a New Relic account You can list all rules in a New Relic account or return a specific rule. Example listing all rules for account 123456: query { actor { account(id:123456) { eventsToMetrics{ allRules{ rules{ id name enabled nrql description } } } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description query One of the basic API operation types. Used to query but not make changes. actor This specifies the current New Relic user. account(id: 123456) Specify the ID for the New Relic account where to retrieve data. eventsToMetrics Scope the data only for events-to-metrics, logs-to-metrics, or spans-to-metrics rules. allRules Returns all rules for that account. rules In the rules block, you can define what data you want returned. Available fields include: id name description nrql accountId enabled Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"allRules\": { \"rules\": [ { \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" }, { \"description\": \"Metric for duration\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"Duration Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy List rule by rule ID If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now you want to list its contents so you can review it. Example listing rule 36 for New Relic account 123456: query { actor { account(id: 123456) { eventsToMetrics { rulesById(ruleIds: \"36\") { rules { id name enabled nrql description accountId } } } } } } Copy For more details about the elements in this query, see List all rules. Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"rulesById\": { \"rules\": [ { \"accountId\": 123456, \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"36\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool You can use our GraphiQL tool to explore the data structure. You can also use it to build and run the operations to convert events, logs, and spans to metrics. To use this tool: Create the metrics operation's request with the required parameters. Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql, and paste your query into the box. To execute the operation, press Play. Or, to get the cURL format, select Copy as cURL.) Validate the response in the response box. Optional: To verify that your rule-creation operation was performed successfully, run a list query for that rule ID.",

      "body": "You can manage alerts conditions using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some conditions queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. This document covers the following: Steps to create a NRQL condition NRQL static condition NRQL baseline condition NRQL outlier condition Update a condition Update mutations List and filter NRQL conditions Singular NRQL condition queries Create a description Delete conditions Steps to create a NRQL condition Follow these steps: Decide which condition type you want to create (see NRQL Condition threshold types). Find your relevant policyID by doing one of the following: Use the NerdGraph policies API. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Choose a policy. Find the ID under the policy name. Provide the appropriate mutation for your NRQL condition type and the relevant values. Tip The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer is the best place to find up-to-date documentation about the per-field specifics of the NerdGraph NRQL Conditions API. For example, questions like \"What does the valueFunction field accept?\" are best answered with the inline NerdGraph documentation. NRQL static condition Here's an example of creating a static condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Low Host Count - Catastrophic\" enabled: true nrql: { query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='my-app-name'\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 aggregationMethod: EVENT_FLOW aggregationDelay: 120 } terms: { threshold: 2 thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE thresholdDuration: 600 operator: BELOW priority: CRITICAL } valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name } } Copy NRQL baseline condition Here's an example of creating a baseline condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" enabled: true baselineDirection: UPPER_ONLY nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 aggregationMethod: EVENT_FLOW aggregationDelay: 120 } terms: { threshold: 13 thresholdDuration: 180 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name baselineDirection } } Copy NRQL outlier condition Here's an example of creating an outlier condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionOutlierCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Outlier Condition\" enabled: true expectedGroups: 4 openViolationOnGroupOverlap: false nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 aggregationMethod: EVENT_FLOW aggregationDelay: 120 } terms: { threshold: 1 thresholdDuration: 300 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name expectedGroups openViolationOnGroupOverlap } } Copy Update a condition Complete the following: Determine the type of your existing condition by requesting the type field in a nrqlConditionsSearch query like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id type } } } } } } Copy Tip The type returned is what you use for your update mutation. For example, if the type returned is STATIC, use alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate. If the type returned is BASELINE, use alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate. If the type returned is OUTLIER, use alertsNrqlConditionOutlierUpdate. Provide the id of your condition to your relevant condition type mutation. Note that you can only update conditions of the relevant type. Only provide update mutations for the fields you want to update. Fields you don't provide in the update are not touched. Update mutations Only fields that you provide in the update are changed. In the following example, baselineDirection returns unchanged, but name is updated. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID, accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, condition: { name: \"Your updated name\" }) { id name baselineDirection } } Copy List and filter NRQL conditions To list or filter your NRQL conditions, use the nrqlConditionsSearch query in NerdGraph. Use cursor pagination The basic of list functionality for NRQL conditions allows you to paginate through your NRQL conditions as well as request the total count of conditions per account. The nrqlConditionsSearch query utilizes cursor pagination to paginate through resources. The idea behind cursor pagination is that the client will request a cursor in a programmatic loop until the cursor comes back empty. An initial list response will look something like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } Copy This example returns a JSON response like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nextCursor\": \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"id\": \"4432\", \"name\": \"Baseline Condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"443\", \"name\": \"A static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\" }, // more conditions here in reality ], \"totalCount\": 435 } } } } } } Copy In order to paginate through conditions in the response, have the client request the cursor to be returned until the nextCursor returns from the response as null: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(cursor: \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", ) { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } Copy Request type-specific fields Certain fields are only available on specific NRQL condition types. The main reason that mutations are split between the different condition types is because they have minor differences between the fields they accept. For example, valueFunction is only relevant for static NRQL conditions and baselineDirection is only relevant on baseline NRQL conditions. But if these fields are only available on these certain condition types, how do we return them in a list of all of our condition types? The answer is a GraphQL convention known as inline fragments. Inline fragments allow you to access the data on a specific type of NRQL condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id name type ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } ...on AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition { baselineDirection } ...on AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition { expectedGroups } } } } } } } Copy In the previous example query, we are asking GraphQL to do the hard work for us to determine which NRQL conditions are the correct type. So, when the returned type is a static condition, it will return the valueFunction in the object. When the returned type is a baseline condition, it will return baselineDirection instead, and when the type is an outlier condition, it will return expectedGroups. Here is an example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"baselineDirection\": \"UPPER_ONLY\", \"id\": \"342\", \"name\": \"My baseline condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"553\", \"name\": \"My static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\", \"valueFunction\": \"SINGLE_VALUE\" }, { \"expectedGroups\": 4, \"id\": \"802\", \"name\": \"My outlier condition\", \"type\": \"OUTLIER\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Filter NRQL conditions You can filter NRQL conditions with the searchCriteria argument of the nrqlConditionsSearch query: Here's an example of filtering NRQL conditions with matching by name. This query returns NRQL conditions that match the provided name. Note that this match is case insensitive. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(searchCriteria: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" }) { nrqlConditions { id name type } } } } } } Copy Singular NRQL condition queries You can use the NRQL condition API to query for a singular condition. Run the nrqlCondition query in the alerts namespace. Similar to type specific fields on the nrqlConditionSearch query, you can also use these inline fragments to request fields that are restricted to a NRQL condition type. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id name ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } } } } } } Copy Update the description This will walk you through the procedure to create a description for a NRQL alert condition. Get all the conditions for a policy: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditions(policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID) { nextCursor results { id name description enabled nrql { query } signal { aggregationWindow aggregationMethod aggregationDelay aggregationTimer } policyId runbookUrl terms { duration operator priority timeFunction threshold } type violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Get the details for a single condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\") { description id enabled name nrql { query } signal { aggregationWindow aggregationMethod aggregationDelay aggregationTimer } policyId runbookUrl terms { operator priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } type violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } Copy Create a mutation with the description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { description } } Copy Here's an example mutation with an included example description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: { description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"} ) { description } } Copy Delete conditions You can use the alertsConditionDelete mutation to delete any type of condition. You can only request the id field on a delete mutation; for example: mutation { alertsConditionDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id } } Copy",

If you're not migrating from the old Insights API, you can skip this doc and go to the new Dashboards API. Why a new dashboards API? Our Insights product, which was a way to query data and create charts and dashboards, has been deprecated and its set of features moved over to be a core part of the New Relic One platform. To learn more about this transition and new features, see the Insights to New Relic One migration guide. The Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated in July of 2021. Until then, if you're using the Insights Dashboard API, you should attempt to switch over to using NerdGraph. (The Insights query API will not be deprecated but NerdGraph is preferred.) Keep reading to learn how to get started with NerdGraph and learn about equivalent operations. Get started with NerdGraph NerdGraph is the preferred API for making NRQL queries of your New Relic data. Every user who uses NerdGraph needs their own user key. When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services.

Insights API operation NerdGraph API query/mutation Notes List (GET) entitySearch() View a paginated list of dashboards that match the filter. Show (GET) entity() View an existing dashboard given its entity guid. Create (POST) dashboardCreate() Create a new dashboard. Update (PUT) dashboardUpdate() Update an existing dashboard given its entity guid. Delete (DELETE) dashboardDelete() Delete an existing dashboard given its entity guid. Dashboard properties mapping table For more information about all the fields in the new dashboards GraphQL schema, have a look at NerdGraph's GraphiQL explorer.

By using the NerdGraph API explorer, you can discover GraphQL types and fields, along with a brief explanation. We want to facilitate your migration from the Insights API to the new New Relic One dashboards API. Find below some examples that illustrate how the old REST endpoints map to the new GraphQL queries or mutations. List (GET) -> entitySearch query Dashboards in New Relic One embrace the concept of entity. They are now another entity in New Relic’s entity ecosystem. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. List all dashboard entities you have access to { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by name { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {name: \"My dashboard\"}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s email { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD, tags: {key: \"createdBy\", value: \"email@domain.com\"}}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s user id { actor { entitySearch(query: \"type ='DASHBOARD' and ownerId = '2357322'\") { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy Show (GET) -> entity query In order to get information on a dashboard, all you need is to provide its unique entity identifier or entity guid. Then you can access all the dashboard properties that you are interested in by adding them in the GraphQL query. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Get dashboard info given its entity guid { actor { entity(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { ... on DashboardEntity { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } } Copy Create (POST) -> dashboardCreate mutation Operations that mutate the state of the system are mutations in GraphQL APIs. You can create a dashboard by providing the required input for the dashboardCreate mutation. Although GraphQL APIs aim to be self-explanatory, Nerdgraph docs can help you with some information about the fields, like the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Create dashboard with two pages and two widgets per page mutation { dashboardCreate(accountId: 1, dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.markdown\" }, title: \"My markdown widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { text: \"#My markdown\" } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.billboard\" }, title: \"My billboard widget with thresholds\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" }], thresholds: [{ alertSeverity: WARNING, value: 650 }, { alertSeverity: CRITICAL, value: 1500 }] } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Update (PUT) -> dashboardUpdate mutation The dashboardUpdate mutation allows you to update an existing dashboard by providing the existing dashboard guid and the new configuration. Similarly to creating a dashboard, the mutation tries to be self-explanatory, but you can look up the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Update previously created dashboard to 1 page and 1 widget per page mutation { dashboardUpdate(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\" dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Delete (DELETE) -> dashboardDelete mutation The dashboardDelete mutation allows you to delete an existing dashboard by providing its entity guid. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Delete previously created dashboard mutation { dashboardDelete(guid:\"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { status errors { type description } } } Copy",

      "body": "This doc contains tutorials on how to use NerdGraph to programmatically manage some New Relic API keys. For general information about New Relic keys, see API keys. Overview of feature description You can use the API keys UI to create and manage keys. Alternatively, you can use NerdGraph's ApiAccess field to programmatically create and manage the following types of keys: User keys License keys, including: General license key (used for APM, infrastructure monitoring, more) Browser key (for browser monitoring) One common use case for this feature is the ability to create and manage license keys to let you rotate keys for security purposes. Note that you can't use this NerdGraph functionality to manage or delete your original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage the ones you've created. Notes about this functionality: All mutations can accept multiple keys as arguments, and will return details about successful changes and errors. See examples below for details. All mutations (create, update and delete) will result in an NrAuditEvent that can be queried for auditing purposes. For details, see Audit events. Regarding license keys: License keys are categorized by NerdGraph as ingest keys. This is because their main use is to allow data ingest. You can create up to 1,000 keys of each license key type, which allows for key rotation. You can't manage or delete original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage keys you've created. Before using examples Things to note before using these example queries: The examples below use license keys (aka ingest keys), but you can query user keys in similar ways, replacing the ingest-key-specific fields with user-key-specific fields. To understand the data structure, we recommend experimenting with queries using the GraphiQL explorer. You can also create, view, and delete user keys using the UI. Create keys Tip You can find and generate user keys using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, at the top of that interface. To create multiple keys (user key or license key) in a single mutation, for multiple accounts and key types. Note that the mutation can return successfully created keys as well as any errors encountered trying to create keys. Example of creating a key: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {ingest: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ingestType: BROWSER, name: \"Browser Key\", notes: \"A note.\"}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Here's an example of using this query to create a user key: Create a user key To create a user key, you'd change the above query slightly, in the keys section: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {user: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, userId: YOUR_USER_ID}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Copy Update keys The update mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. mutation { apiAccessUpdateKeys(keys: {ingest: {keyId: KEY_ID, name: \"Updated name\", notes: \"A new note!\"}}) { updatedKeys { id key type name notes } errors { message } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Delete keys The delete mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. Deleted keys will no longer grant access to New Relic systems and will no longer be returned by queries to the API access GraphQL API. mutation { apiAccessDeleteKeys(keys: {ingestKeyIds: INGEST_KEY_ID}) { deletedKeys { id } errors { message } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Query keys You can access ingest and user keys by querying a single key or all keys, scoped to the actor. If querying for a single key, you must provide the key ID and type (INGEST or USER). Querying for multiple keys is done via a key search, which uses a mandatory types list and an optional scope to filter results. User keys belonging to other users will be obfuscated in the results. Single key example query: query { actor { apiAccess { key(id: INGEST_KEY_ID, keyType: INGEST) { key name type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } Copy Key search example query: query { actor { apiAccess { keySearch(query: {types: INGEST, scope: {ingestTypes: BROWSER}}) { keys { name key type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries.",

Want to try out our Metric API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. What is the Metric API? The Metric API is a way to get metric data into New Relic. The API works by sending a POST request to our HTTP endpoint with a JSON payload containing the metric data. The Metric API is how metrics are ingested from some of our integrations, including our open source exporters (like DropWizard, OpenCensus, and Prometheus). The Metric API is also used by our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that make it easier to use our data-ingest APIs. The Metric API can be used to: Report metric data to New Relic without a New Relic agent. Integrate metric data from an open source or in-house developed tool, library, or framework. Fully control the metric data you're sending, including the resolution and associated dimensions. Leverage the power of NRQL, New Relic's query language, for querying your metric data. Set up alerts for your metric data. Requirements Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name metric-api.newrelic.com or metric-api.eu.newrelic.com. You'll need a New Relic license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. For information on limits and restricted attributes, see Metric API requirements and limits. Get started If we don't have an existing integration that meets your metric-reporting needs, you have two options: Use our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that help you send us metrics and other data. Use the Metric API directly. Find and use your data You can find data sent via the Metric API (including from integrations that use this API) in these locations: From one.newrelic.com, select Explorer and look for your service. By querying the Metric data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Metric Copy For more on querying, see Metric query examples. For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Troubleshooting See Troubleshoot an NrIntegrationError event.",

      "body": "You can use baseline conditions to define violation thresholds that adjust to the behavior of your data. Baseline alerting is useful for creating conditions that: Only notify you when data is behaving abnormally. Dynamically adjust to changing data and trends, including daily or weekly trends. In addition, baseline alerting works well with new applications when you do not yet have known behaviors. How it works When you choose a data source (for example, an APM metric) for a baseline condition, we'll use the past values of that data to dynamically predict the data's near-future behavior. The line of that predicted future behavior for that value is called a baseline. It appears as a dotted black line on the preview chart in the baseline condition UI. You'll use the baseline alert condition UI to: Adjust how sensitive the condition is to fluctuations in the data source. Set the behavior that will trigger a violation (for example: \"deviating for more than five minutes\"). Set whether you want the condition to check for upper violations, lower violations, or both. When your data escapes the predicted \"normal\" behavior and meets the criteria you've chosen, you'll receive a notification. Set baseline thresholds one.newrelic.com > AI & Alerts > Policies > (create or select policy) > Create alert condition: Baseline alert conditions give you the ability to set intelligent, self-adjusting thresholds that only generate violations when abnormal behavior is detected. To create a baseline condition, go to one.newrelic.com > AI & Alerts > Policies > (create or select policy) > Create alert condition: When you start to create a condition, choose one of the following data sources: NRQL: Create a NRQL condition and then choose baseline APM: Application metric baseline Browser: Metric baseline Here are some tips for setting baseline thresholds: Set the baseline direction to monitor violations that happen either above or below the baseline. Set the preview chart to either 2 days or 7 days of displayed data. (Not applicable for NRQL alert conditions.) Use the slider bar to adjust the Critical threshold sensitivity, represented in the preview chart by the light gray area around the baseline. The tighter the band around the baseline, the more sensitive it is and the more violations it will generate. Optional: You can create a Warning threshold (the darker gray area around the baseline). For NRQL alerts, see the allowed types of NRQL queries. If the alert condition applies to multiple apps, you can select a choice from the dropdown above the chart to use different metrics. (Not applicable for NRQL alert conditions.) Faceted baseline conditions NRQL alerts conditions support faceted baselines. In the chart legend, click a time series to scope it to a single facet. Once you've run a faceted NRQL query for a baseline condition, you can scope your results to a single baseline. Click Return to full timeseries list to go back to seeing all your facets. The single time series shows the baseline, threshold band, and one or more violation regions, if there are any. Baseline rules and settings Here are some details about how the UI works: Rules governing creation of baseline The algorithm for baseline conditions is mathematically complex. Here are some of the major rules governing its predictive abilities: Data trait Baseline rules Age of data On initial creation, the baseline is calculated using between 1 to 4 weeks of data, depending on data availability and baseline type. After its creation, the algorithm will take into account ongoing data fluctuations over a long time period, although greater weight is given to more recent data. For data that has only existed for a short time, the baseline will likely fluctuate a good deal and not be very accurate. This is because there is not yet enough data to determine its usual values and behavior. The more history the data has, the more accurate the baseline and thresholds will become. Consistency of data For metric values that remain in a consistent range or that trend slowly and steadily, their more predictable behavior means that their thresholds will become tighter around the baseline. Data that is more varied and unpredictable will have looser (wider) thresholds. Regular fluctuations For shorter-than-one-week cyclical fluctuations (such as weekly Wednesday 1pm deployments or nightly reports), the baseline algorithm looks for these cyclical fluctuations and attempts to adjust to them. Baseline direction: select upper or lower ranges You can choose whether you want the condition to violate for behavior that goes above the baseline (\"upper\") or that goes below the baseline (\"lower\"), or that goes either above or below. You choose these with the Baseline direction selector. Example use cases for this: You might use the Upper setting for a data source like error rate, because you generally are only concerned if it goes up, and aren't concerned if it goes down. You might use the Lower setting for a data source like throughput, because sudden upward fluctuations are quite common, but a large sudden downswing would be a sign of a problem. Here are examples of how large fluctuations in your data would be treated under the different baseline direction settings. The red areas represent violations. Preview chart: select 2 or 7 days Not applicable for NRQL alert conditions. When setting thresholds, the preview chart has an option for displaying Since 2 days ago or Since 7 days ago. These selections are not the time period used to compute the baseline; they are only the time range used for a preview display. For more about the time range used to calculate the baseline, see the algorithm rules.",

Troubleshoot data ingest with NrIntegrationError Our NrIntegrationError event is used to capture issues related to: Exceeding of our data ingest limits Exceeding of our query limits Malformed data Configuration issues You can run NRQL queries to analyze NrIntegrationError error messages. You can also set up alerts to be notified when specific types of errors, or certain quantities of errors, occur. NrIntegrationError events are primarily categorized by the feature that is sending them, as indicated by the newRelicFeature attribute. Values include: Metrics indicates an issue with Metric API ingest. Event API indicates an issue with Event API ingest. Logs indicates an issue with logs ingest. Distributed Tracing indicates an issue with distributed tracing (Span) data. For attribute definitions, see the data dictionary. Query and alert You can query NrIntegrationError events using NRQL, and set up NRQL alert conditions to get notified when issues happen. Here are some examples of queries: Query of Event API issues Here's a simple query of NrIntegrationError. This one shows Event API ingest issues from the last week, with up to 100 results: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO LIMIT 100 Copy For more detailed queries, see Example queries. Query of Metric API issues Here's a simple query of issues with the Metric API: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO LIMIT 100 Copy For more detailed queries, see Example queries. Limit-related queries See Data limits. Query of distributed tracing issues Here's a simple query of issues with distributed tracing data: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Distributed Tracing' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO LIMIT 100 Copy For more detailed queries, see Example queries. Query of issues over time Here's a query showing a count of NrIntegrationError events over time: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' TIMESERIES Copy For more detailed queries, see Example queries.

      "body": "You have options for the type and the amount of data you ingest when you install Auto-telemetry with Pixie. During install, use Helm to reduce or exclude data, either by excluding specific namespaces or pods, or by collecting data for only the nodes you want. Exclude namespaces and pods If you want to reduce the amount of Pixie data that New Relic ingests, you can exclude namespaces or pods by adding the following parameters to your Helm chart during installation. Note that the data still exists in Pixie: excludeNamespacesRegex - use to identify the namespaces that you want to exclude from sending observability data to New Relic. If empty, data for all namespaces is sent to New Relic. For example: --set newrelic-pixie.excludeNamespacesRegex=\"examplenamespace-1|examplenamespace-2\" Copy excludePodsRegex - use to identify pods across all namespaces that you want to exclude from sending observability data to New Relic. If empty, data for all pods (except those in excluded namespaces) is sent to New Relic. For example: --set newrelic-pixie.excludePodsRegex=\"examplepod-1|examplepod-2\" Copy These two configuration options provide additional control over the Metric and Span data sent to New Relic from Pixie. For example, if you wanted to configure the newrelic-pixie integration to exclude all namespaces except for px-sock-shop and kafka-demo, append the following config parameter to your Helm install or Helm upgrade command. --set newrelic-pixie.excludeNamespacesRegex=\"default|kube-node-lease|kube-public|kube-system|newrelic|newrelic-custom-metrics|olm|px-operator\" Copy Or, if you wanted to exclude pods running in a non-excluded namespace, you could add another configuration parameter to your Helm install or Helm upgrade. Instead of matching exact names, you can use a simple regex to match pod names related to load testing, just as an example. --set newrelic-pixie.excludePodsRegex=\"load-test.*|loadgen.*\" Copy If you're performing a brand new install, you'll need to append excludeNamespacesRegex and excludePodsRegex to the helm upgrade --install command provided by New Relic's guided install: kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pixie-labs/pixie/main/k8s/operator/crd/base/px.dev_viziers.yaml && \\ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pixie-labs/pixie/main/k8s/operator/helm/crds/olm_crd.yaml && \\ helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com && helm repo update && \\ kubectl create namespace newrelic ; helm upgrade --install newrelic-bundle newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --set global.licenseKey=<NR LICENSE KEY> \\ --set global.cluster=pixie-auto-telemetry \\ --namespace=newrelic \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-pixie.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-pixie.apiKey=<PIXIE API KEY> \\ --set pixie-chart.enabled=true \\ --set pixie-chart.deployKey=<PIXIE DEPLOY KEY> \\ --set pixie-chart.clusterName=pixie-auto-telemetry \\ --set newrelic-pixie.excludeNamespacesRegex=\"default|kube-node-lease|kube-public|kube-system|newrelic|newrelic-custom-metrics|olm|px-operator\" \\ --set newrelic-pixie.excludePodsRegex=\"load-test.*|loadgen.*\" Copy If you're just upgrading an existing install, then this is a much simpler approach: helm upgrade newrelic-bundle newrelic/nri-bundle --reuse-values -n newrelic --set newrelic-pixie.excludeNamespacesRegex=\"default|kube-node-lease|kube-public|kube-system|newrelic|newrelic-custom-metrics|olm|px-operator Copy Learn more about the available parameters for the newrelic-pixie Helm chart here. Use Kubernetes features to collect selected data When you deploy Auto-telemetry with Pixie, you're actually enabling the Auto-telemetry with Pixie Helm chart, as well as other New Relic components included in the New Relic infrastructure bundle. The Pixie Edge Module (PEM) pods are deployed to the cluster as a Kubernetes DaemonSet. This means that by default, a pod is scheduled to every cluster node and is responsible for collecting all of the observability metrics for that node. In Kubernetes, you can assign pods to a specific subset of cluster nodes using nodeSelectors, taints/tolerations, and node affinity/anti-affinity. That way, you'll only collect metrics for the nodes you choose, instead of every node. This is helpful if you only want to deploy Auto-telemetry with Pixie to five of your ten cluster nodes, for example. Maybe the designated five nodes are responsible for high-priority workloads, or perhaps you're running both Linux and Windows nodes in your cluster and only want to deploy on the Linux nodes, since Windows nodes are not currently supported. You can now assign pods to a subset of nodes by providing an additional option to the guided installation command. This option passes an escaped JSON string to the Auto-telemetry with Pixie chart, which enables a nodeSelector that only schedules the PEM DaemonSet on nodes with the label pixie=allowed. --set pixie-chart.patches.vizier-pem='\\{\\\"spec\\\"\\: \\{\\\"template\\\"\\: \\{\\\"spec\\\"\\: \\{ \\\"nodeSelector\\\"\\: \\{\\\"pixie\\\"\\: \\\"allowed\\\" \\}\\}\\}\\}\\}' Copy If you're using a values file, common with Helm, then this is what that would look like in the nri-bundle values.yaml: pixie-chart: enabled: true patches: vizier-pem: '{\"spec\": {\"template\": {\"spec\": { \"nodeSelector\": {\"pixie\": \"allowed\" }}}}}' Copy This approach gives you a multitude of configuration options; you just need to stick with the standard Kubernetes spec.",

      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why some services are raising alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the error alerts in your services. Step 1 of 8 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal have opened critical violations for high error percentages: Tip If you don't see all the same alerts, don't worry. The simulated issues happen at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. The deployment has created an alert condition for cases where a service's error percentage rises above 10% for 5 minutes or longer. A critical violation means that the service's conditions violate that threshold. Begin your investigation by selecting the Telco-Web Portal service name. Step 2 of 8 You're now on the web portal's APM summary page. The top graph, Web transactions time, shows you the service's response times. By default, it also displays periods of critical violation. On the right-hand side of the view, Application activity shows when violations opened and closed: From the left-hand navigation, select Events > Errors to learn more about the errors: At the bottom of the view, the Errors table shows you what errors occurred in the service along with number of times each error occurred. In this scenario, the only error in the service has the following message: bash Copy An error occurred during a downstream request to http://35.182.223.70:7001/api/inventory detail:response code 500 This is a helpful message that explains that the web portal made a request to another service, raised an error, and responded with a response code of 500, indicating an Internal server error. Since this message tells you that the error occurred while the web portal was making an outbound request, use distributed tracing to better understand the issue. Select Monitor > Distributed tracing from the left-hand navigation. Step 3 of 8 Distributed tracing provides end-to-end information about a request. In this case, you're looking for a request to the web portal that raised an error, so that you can better understand what happened during that request. Filter the table, by selecting the Errors column header twice, to order by descending counts: Select the first row in the table: This trace gives a lot of information about what happened with the request once the web portal received it. One of the things that the trace reveals is that the web portal made a GET request to Telco-Login Service and received an error. The trace indicates an error by coloring the text red. Select the row (called a span) to see more information about the request to the login service: Expand Error details to see the error message: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic Interesting! This message says that, at the time that the web portal made the GET request to the login service, the login service was not ready to accept traffic. Inspect the login service to dive further into the root cause of these cascading errors. Return to the APM page, and select Telco-Login Service. Step 4 of 8 Notice that the APM summary for Telco-Login Service has similar red flags to the ones in the web portal: Web transactions time has a red error indicator, and Application activity shows critical violations. More than that, the times that the errors occurred in both services match up (around 10:53 AM, in this example). Step 5 of 8 Web transactions time, in APM, shows that requests to the login service spend all their time in Java code. So, in the left-hand navigation, open Monitor > JVMs: Java Virtual Machines, or JVMs, run Java processes, such as those used by the login service. This view shows resource graphs for each JVM your service uses. Change the timeslice to look at data for the last 3 hours, so you can get a better idea of how the service has been behaving: Notice, in Heap memory usage, that the line for Used Heap rises consistently over 30 minute intervals. About two-thirds of the way through each interval, the line for Committed Heap (the amount of JVM heap memory dedicated for use by Java processes) quickly rises to accommodate the increasing memory demands. This graph indicates that the Java process is leaking memory. Step 6 of 8 Your Java process is leaking memory, but you need to understand the extent of the leak's impact. Navigate to the login service's host infrastructure view to dive a little deeper. First, go to the Telco-Login Service summary page and turn off Show new view: Then, scroll to the bottom of the page, and select the host's name: Right now, you can only select the host's name from the old version of the UI (we're working on it). So, make sure you toggle off Show new view. In this infrastructure view, Memory Used % for Telco-Authentication-host consistently climbs from around 60% to around 90% over 30-minute intervals, matching the intervals in the JVM's heap memory usage graph: Therefore, the memory leak effects the login service's entire host. Click and drag on Memory Used % to narrow the timeslice to one of the peaks: Now, compare this graph with the login service's Errors graph to see how they relate. Step 7 of 8 Open New Relic in a new tab. From APM, select Telco-Login Service. Then, navigate to Events > Errors. By comparing these graphs, you see that the memory percentage reached its peak at 10:25 AM (in this example) and then dropped off. You also see that errors started occurring in the login service just after that, at 10:26 AM. The message for those errors is the same one you saw earlier: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic This suggests that the memory leaks cause the application to fail for a time. To understand the error a bit more, select the error class from the table at the bottom of the view: The stack trace shows that the service raised an UnhandledException from a function called EnsureAppIsStarted: With the information you've collected so far, you can conclude that Telco-Login Service's Java code has a memory leak. Also, the login service restarts the application when it runs out of memory, and it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests while the app is restarting. You also know the login service is effecting the web portal, because that is what introduced you to this problem, but does the issue effect any other services? Step 8 of 8 Visualize service dependencies using service maps. First, navigate back to APM, and from Telco-Login Service, select Monitor > Service map: Both Telco-Web Portal and Telco-Warehouse Portal depend on Telco-Login Service. So, when the login service goes down, you start seeing errors in both portals. Extra Credit Use the same steps you used to investigate issues in the web portal to confirm there are issues in the warehouse portal. Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal raise alerts during critical violations The login service's Java processes leak memory When the login service's host, Telco-Authentication-host, runs out of memory, it restarts the login application While the login application is restarting, it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests When the web portal and the warehouse portal make requests to the login service while it's restarting, they receive errors and raise errors of their own Now, as a Telco Lite developer, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the memory leak. Congratulations! Learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why Telco-Warehouse Portal has slower-than-normal response times. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the high response times in your services. Step 1 of 6 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that the response time for Telco-Warehouse Portal is 43 seconds, much higher than the response times in other services: On the APM page, select the Telco-Warehouse Portal service name to see a summary of that service. The top graph in the summary view shows Web transactions time: You see several peaks, reaching almost 50,000 milliseconds—or 50 seconds! From this graph, you can actually gain a little more insight by toggling the colored components beneath the graph. For example, select Node.js: The graph changes to show only what the Node.js component contributes to the overall response time—less than 100 ms, in this example. Now, select Web external and deselect Node.js: External web traffic is the primary contributor to the high response times. That's a good start, but it doesn't tell the whole story. Next, dive deeper to find out which external service is causing the issue. Step 2 of 6 So, you know that Web external is the culprit of the high response times, but it's hard to tell why. External web traffic is all the requests made from your service to other services. This means you should look into what external requests that the warehouse portal makes to try to understand exactly what external service is the bottleneck. From the left-hand navigation, select Monitor > Distributed tracing: This view shows you requests to the warehouse portal. Select a request from the table at the bottom of the view to see a trace through that request: This trace shows that one external request contributes almost all of the total trace duration. Specifically, an external request to the Telco-Fulfillment Service contributes over 99% of the overall response time. This is good news! You own the fulfillment service, which means you can drill down for even more information. Select the offending row (called a span), and then select Explore this transaction: Step 3 of 6 You're now looking at the __main__:inventory_item transaction overview. Because you know that some part of this transaction is slow, you can use this overview to narrow your focus even further. Similar to how you modified the warehouse portal APM graph, you can look specifically at the components of this transaction to understand where the root cause of the slowness is. Another way to view this information is to scroll down to the Breakdown table in that same view: Function/__main__:inventory_item, a Python function, contributes over 99% of the overall response time. At this point, you know that Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow. You also know that the issue in the fulfillment service is local because over 99% of the request is spent in Python code, not external services. Navigate to the fulfillment service's summary page to look at the service as a whole, instead of this single transaction: Step 4 of 6 Scroll down on this view to familiarize yourself with the graphs it shows, such as Throughput and Error rate. At the bottom of the page, you can see a table with the fulfillment hosts. You can't currently drill into a specific host in the new UI (we're working on it), but you can in the old UI. Toggle Show new view to off and select the host link: Step 5 of 6 Now, you're looking at graphs in the infrastructure view for that service's host. Notice that CPU % has a lot of high spikes. Click and drag on the graph from the start of a spike to the end of it to narrow the timeslice to the period when CPU utilization goes up: If you compare this graph to the fulfillment service's transaction graph you looked at earlier, you'll see that soon after __main__:inventory_item begins executing, the CPU utilization of the host sharply rises to 100%! Step 6 of 6 Now, you understand the problem causing slow response times in the warehouse portal, but you don't know the extent of the issue. Using service maps, you can see all your services that depend on the fullfillment service. Navigate to the service map under APM > Telco-Fulfillment Service: This map shows you the fulfillment service's incoming and outgoing dependencies. Not only is Telco-Warehouse Portal dependent on the fullfillment service, but so is Telco-Web Portal! Select the web portal node to see that the fulfillment service also affects the web portal's response times: Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow The fulfillment service's Python function contributes over 99% of the response time Soon after the Python function starts executing, the host's CPU utilization spikes up to 100% The fulfillment service also affects Telco-Web Portal response times Now, as the developer behind the fulfillment service, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the CPU spikes. Congratulations! You can learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, you can tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABlE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "With the data explorer you can navigate all your data visually, without any NRQL knowledge. Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces query interfaces to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From the data explorer you can access the query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

      "info": "Learn how to provision New Relic resources using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).",
      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.12\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostConditions directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your main.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add main.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible.

In this guide, you will use Terragrunt to generate your Terraform configurations, create files with Terragrunt, and reuse the Terragrunt configuration to manage multiple environments. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic Infrastructure agent for your host. Also, install the Terraform CLI.

In the next steps, you will create a new configuration using Terragrunt, Terraform, and New Relic. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terragrunt-config && cd terragrunt-config In the new directory, create a terragrunt.hcl file, create a ./src directory, and create a ./environments directory: bash Copy $ touch terragrunt.hcl $ mkdir src $ mkdir environments Inside of your environments folder, create a folder named dev. In the ./src directory, create a main.tf and provider.tf files: bash Copy $ mkdir environments/dev $ touch src/main.tf $ touch src/provider.tf In the provider.tf file add the appropriate Terraform and New Relic provider configuration information: terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } Copy In the main.tf add a New Relic alert policy named DemoPolicy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Copy In the ./environments/dev directory create a new file named terragrunt.hcl bash Copy $ cd ./environments/dev/ $ touch terragrunt.hcl Within the dev folder update the terragrunt.hcl file by adding the following include statement. The include statement tells Terragrunt to use any .hcl confgiuration files it finds in parent folders. include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } Copy Next, add a Terraform block to provide Terragrunt with a Terraform source reference. terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Now you need to configure the provider with your New Relic account details. You will need your New Relic user API key and account ID. provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you have a single account: The account ID is displayed on the API keys page. If your organization has multiple accounts: From one.newrelic.com, select Entity explorer and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page. Tip Documentation about the New Relic provider is provided on the Terraform doc site. Update the provider.tf file to define the New Relic account variables that will help keep the Terraform configuration dynamic. variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy In your terminal, change directories to the environments/dev folder and run the command terragrunt init: bash Copy $ terragrunt init Terraform init sets up a bit of context, sets up environment variables, and then runs terraform init. You will see the following output: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. [terragrunt] [/Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev] 2021/02/02 13:30:31 Copying lock file [output] from /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev/.terragrunt-cache/e-PoBgWhdv3v8QGOtDQxS_WeYu4/ 69zjIFUfApJiUt8gFmi-6-dcPe8/.terraform.lock.hcl to /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy $ terragrunt plan Terragrunt starts to run but pauses to ask for the inputs to the New Relic account variables added to the provider.tf file. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2/02 13:32:08 Running command: terraform plan var.newrelic_account_id Enter a value: Interrupt received. Exit the terragrunt plan process with CTRL+C .

Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Run terragrunt apply. After Terraform finishes process, check your New Relic account for the new Demo Policy. Step 2 of 6 Adding to your configuration Now that you have a basic New Relic configuration created, add configurations built in the Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides in this step. Tip If you haven't done the previous developer guides, you can copy the configurations for this section from the Terragrunt Intro Github Repo. Update the main.tf to include the additional terraform configurations. Update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy You have added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. To clone the module from GitHub, run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply. After Terraform is done processing, You will see your Demo Policy now has two conditions in your New Relic account and one alert channel attached. Step 3 of 6 Using your Environment as a Terragrunt Variable Using Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you are running to the name of the data you are creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create a new input for env_name inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy in the main.tf file add a new variable for 'env_name' variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Using string interpolation, add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks. resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to the configuration name. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Currently, the environment variable name is hardcoded into the root terragrunt.hcl file. You want to avoid having your variables hardcoded, using a terragrunt built-in function will pass the value. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use the path_relative_to_include() built-in function and pass the value has the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output, the env_name variable will have the entire ./environments/dev/ path. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Next, update the terragrunt.hcl to only include 'dev' as the env_name variable. Adding a locals block creates a local variable, using the replace built-in function will remove the unwanted parts of the relative path, and update the inputs block to use the local variable. locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output the env_name variable will now have 'dev:' added. Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Step 4 of 6 Storing the State Remotely At the moment, the state file is local. The next steps will update your Terraform configurations to remove the local state file and use a file stored remotely in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, various state files will need to be store in separate S3 buckets, not to override each other. Terragrunt allows you to generate files on the fly. Adding the remote_state block into the root level terragrunt.hcl file, you will generate a new file named backend.tf. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"my-terraform-state\" key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true } } Copy After adding the remote_state block, you will need to give the configuration for the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state. Tip To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Now, update the remote_state block to provide your S3 bucket and update the key to use the local environment variable created previously. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Next, run terragrunt plan. If you look in the Amazon S3 bucket, you will see a folder named envs. Within the envs folder is a directory called devs containing terraform.tfstate file. Tip To see the files created by Terragrunt, look inside of the ./environments/dev directory. There is a hidden directory named terragrunt-cache. Within the terragrunt-cache directory, you will see the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Step 5 of 6 Creating a New Environment Now that you have a working configuration for your dev environment, you will create a new environment reusing the dev configurations in the next steps. In the environments directory, create a new folder names nonprod. In the nonprod folder, create a new terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl In the nonprod terragrunt.hcl file copy over the configuration from the environment terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you are using a different account for your nonprod environment, you can update the inputs with a new New Relic account ID and API key. Inside of your nonprod directory, run terragrunt init then run terragrunt apply. In the output, you will see Terraform has created a new set of resources. The new resources should have the nonprod name prefixed. Step 6 of 6 Terragrunt has created two environments, but there is no difference between them other than the name. Adding variables in the configurations allows your configurations to be more dynamic. In the next steps, you will add variables to your configurations. In the main.tf add new variables for the Host Conditions modules cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage values: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy In the main.tf update the HostConditions module values to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Run terragrunt plan. In the output, the HostConditions values have changed to use the variable defaults. Next, you want to pass the values into your environment configurations by adding the inputs block variables. In the nonprod/terragrunt.hcl file, add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy Run terragrunt apply. In your New Relic account, you will see a new policy with configurations changed based on the environment. Conclusion Congratulations! You've used Terragrunt to generate your New Relic configurations and manage multiple environments. Review the Terragrunt Intro Example, New Relic Terraform provider documentation, and Terragrunt quick start to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "You can manage your alert notification channels using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. Get notification channels The notificationChannels query allows you to paginate through all of your notification channels per account. You can also use the notificationChannel query to get a specific notification channel by its ID. Tip Note that certain secret fields (for example passwords or API keys) are obfuscated in the returned fields. List all notification channels for an account This example returns every field for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, up to the page limit of 200. Note how we use inline fragments to refer to the specific fields on the concrete types implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { config { integrationUrl } } ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { config { baseUrl basicAuth { password username } customHttpHeaders { name value } customPayloadBody customPayloadType } } ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { config { key routeKey } } ... on AlertsUserNotificationChannel { config { userId } } ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { config { apiKey } } ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { config { apiKey dataCenterRegion recipients tags teams } } ... on AlertsHipChatNotificationChannel { config { authToken baseUrl roomId } } ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { config { emails includeJson } } ... on AlertsCampfireNotificationChannel { config { room subdomain token } } } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Paginate through notification channels with cursor pagination If a given account's list of notification channels exceeds the 200 channel page limit, you can use the pagination cursor to retrieve additional pages. With cursor pagination, you continue to request additional pages using the nextCursor until that field returns empty in the response. An empty nextCursor signals that you have reached the end of the result set. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"notificationChannels\": { \"channels\": [ { \"id\": \"250\", \"name\": \"Channel 1\", \"type\": \"SLACK\" }, { \"id\": \"713\", \"name\": \"Channel 2\", \"type\": \"WEBHOOK\" }, // ... +198 more notification channels in reality ], \"nextCursor\": \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\", \"totalCount\": 268 } } } } } } Copy In your next request, provide the cursor like so, updating each subsequent request to return the updated cursor, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels(cursor: \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\") { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Find a specific notification channel by id If you have a specific notification channel's ID, the API allows you to look it up directly. Note that because the specific channel is a concrete type implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface, you may need to specify certain fields using the ... on syntax for inline fragments. In this example, we are retrieving a Slack channel: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannel(id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id name type ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } } } } } } Copy List notification channels with their associated policies This example returns the ID, name, and type for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, as well as a list of every policy that is associated with that channel. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type associatedPolicies { policies { id name } totalCount } } nextCursor totalCount } } } } } Copy Create a notification channel In order to create an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to create (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Once a notification channel has been created, it can be associated with one or more alert policies. Once associated, those channels will receive notifications from those policies when conditions are violated. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only create a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Create an email notification channel An example create mutation for an email notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { emails: [\"email@example.com\"], includeJson: true, name: \"Some Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type config { emails includeJson } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an OpsGenie notification channel An example create mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { apiKey: \"api-key-from-opsgenie\", dataCenterRegion: US, name: \"OpsGenie notification channel name\", recipients: [\"user@example.com\"], tags: [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"], teams: [\"team1\", \"team2\"] } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey teams tags recipients dataCenterRegion } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a PagerDuty notification channel An example create mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty notification channel name\", apiKey: \"api-key-from-pagerduty\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Slack notification channel An example create mutation for a Slack notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack notification channel name\", teamChannel: \"#team-channel\", url: \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/FAKE/MOREFAKE/IMAGINARYEXAMPLEURLCHUNK\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type config { teamChannel url } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a VictorOps notification channel An example create mutation for a VictorOps notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { key: \"example-api-key-from-victorops\", name: \"VictorOps notification channel name\", routeKey:

alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { integrationUrl: \"https://company.instance.xmatters.com/api/xm/v<version>/...\", name: \"xMatters notification channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type config { integrationUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Update a notification channel In order to update an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to change (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Consistent with other GraphQL APIs, you can update a single field on the channel without knowing anything other than the channel's ID. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only update a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Update an email notification channel An example update mutation for an email notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { name: \"Updated Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an OpsGenie notification channel An example update mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { name: \"OpsGenie updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a PagerDuty notification channel An example update mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Slack notification channel An example update mutation for a Slack notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a VictorOps notification channel An example update mutation for a VictorOps notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { name: \"VictorOps updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Webhook notification channel An example update mutation for a Webhook notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { name: \"Webhook updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an xMatters notification channel An example update mutation for an xMatters notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { name: \"xMatters updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Delete a notification channel You can delete a notification channel with only the account ID and the channel ID. Note that deleting a channel dissociates it from all policies, meaning that no further notifications will be sent to that channel. mutation { alertsNotificationChannelDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Associate channels to a policy Creating an alert notification channel is not enough: Once the channel has been created, it needs to be associated to one or more policies. Once associated to a policy, the channel can recieve alert notifications when conditions on that policy go into violation. In this example, we associate two channels with a policy: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsAddToPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Dissociate a channel from a policy In those instances where a notification channel has outlived its usefulness (for example, an email list that has been retired), the time has come to dissociate that channel from the policy (or policies) that are sending alert notifications to it. This API call leaves the channel itself intact, but removes it from the specified policy. In this example, we are removing two channels from a policy (leaving any others in place), and getting back confirmation that those two channel IDs have been removed: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsRemoveFromPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Tip Removing an alert notification channel from a policy does not delete the channel because it might be used by other policies. On the other hand, deleting a channel will cause all associated policies to stop sending alert notifications to that channel.",

      "body": "Every time you deploy an application, you hope that it's efficient and error-free. The reality, however, is usually quite different. You might introduce a bug in a release, overlook an edge case, or rely on a broken dependency. These issues, and others, can result in bad user experiences. In this guide, you: Use the open-source New Relic demo-deployer to spin up the infrastructure for Acme Telco Lite, a fictional company. This demo scenario is part of our Demo Catalog and will simulate real-world issues in a controlled, demo environment Use New Relic to understand those issues from the perspective of a Telco Lite developer Use the deployer to tear down the resources you create Welcome to Acme Telco Lite! Acme Telco Lite is a mock telecom business that maintains an eCommerce website for its customers. The site's architecture has eight, interconnected microservices, plus a simulator: The simulator isn't part of the Telco Lite infrastructure, but it is part of the demo deployment. It runs scenarios against the application to create web traffic and generate interesting data in New Relic. Set up your environment Before you begin, follow the Prerequisites guide from the deployer's GitHub repository for a detailed walkthrough of how to set up your environment. For this guide, you can choose between Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host your deployment. The guide steps you through: Installing Docker & pulling the demo-deployer image locally Creating a user config file containing credentials for New Relic and your cloud provider Downloading a .pem key file (if your cloud provider is AWS) Once you're all set up, deploy Acme Telco Lite. Deploy Telco Lite It's time to deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services using demo-deployer. Copy the url for the demo that corresponds to the cloud provider you chose when you set up your environment: AWS Telco Lite Demo Azure Telco Lite Demo GCP Telco Lite Demo Follow the Deployment guide in the Demo Catalog repository for a thorough explanation of how to use the deployer in a local Docker environment. When you run the deployment script, make sure to pass the url you copied for <demo-url>. Tip Since Telco Lite contains several services, the deployment can take over half an hour. When the deloyer is finished, you should see some output stating that the deployment was successful: bash Copy [INFO] Executing Deployment [✔] Parsing and validating Deployment configuration success [✔] Provisioner success [✔] Installing On-Host instrumentation success [✔] Installing Services and instrumentations success [INFO] Deployment successful!

View your services With your services running in the cloud, log in to New Relic and select APM from the top navigation to see how your services are holding up: Yikes! The alerts, high response times, and red-colored indicators suggest things aren't well. Use New Relic to diagnose these issues, which are simultaneously affecting your services: Issue 1: The Warehouse Portal has abnormally high response times Issue 2: Multiple services are raising error alerts Tip Don't worry if you don't see all the same alerts. The simulator triggers issues at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. Tear down Telco Lite When you're finished diagnosing all the issues effecting Telco Lite, follow the Teardown guide in the deployer's repository to tear down the services you created in your cloud provider. If you're still exploring, don't tear down your services, or you'll have to deploy them again later. Conclusion Congratulations, you're done! Throughout this tutorial, you: Used the demo-deployer to deploy Telco Lite to the cloud Used New Relic to investigate simulated issues in Telco Lite services Tore down all the infrastructural resources you created throughout this tutorial Hopefully, you learned a lot about using New Relic to investigate issues in your services.

      "info": "Learn how to use New Relic to diagnose error alerts in your services.",
      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why some services are raising alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the error alerts in your services. Step 1 of 8 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal have opened critical violations for high error percentages: Tip If you don't see all the same alerts, don't worry. The simulated issues happen at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. The deployment has created an alert condition for cases where a service's error percentage rises above 10% for 5 minutes or longer. A critical violation means that the service's conditions violate that threshold. Begin your investigation by selecting the Telco-Web Portal service name. Step 2 of 8 You're now on the web portal's APM summary page. The top graph, Web transactions time, shows you the service's response times. By default, it also displays periods of critical violation. On the right-hand side of the view, Application activity shows when violations opened and closed: From the left-hand navigation, select Events > Errors to learn more about the errors: At the bottom of the view, the Errors table shows you what errors occurred in the service along with number of times each error occurred. In this scenario, the only error in the service has the following message: bash Copy An error occurred during a downstream request to http://35.182.223.70:7001/api/inventory detail:response code 500 This is a helpful message that explains that the web portal made a request to another service, raised an error, and responded with a response code of 500, indicating an Internal server error. Since this message tells you that the error occurred while the web portal was making an outbound request, use distributed tracing to better understand the issue. Select Monitor > Distributed tracing from the left-hand navigation. Step 3 of 8 Distributed tracing provides end-to-end information about a request. In this case, you're looking for a request to the web portal that raised an error, so that you can better understand what happened during that request. Filter the table, by selecting the Errors column header twice, to order by descending counts: Select the first row in the table: This trace gives a lot of information about what happened with the request once the web portal received it. One of the things that the trace reveals is that the web portal made a GET request to Telco-Login Service and received an error. The trace indicates an error by coloring the text red. Select the row (called a span) to see more information about the request to the login service: Expand Error details to see the error message: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic Interesting! This message says that, at the time that the web portal made the GET request to the login service, the login service was not ready to accept traffic. Inspect the login service to dive further into the root cause of these cascading errors. Return to the APM page, and select Telco-Login Service. Step 4 of 8 Notice that the APM summary for Telco-Login Service has similar red flags to the ones in the web portal: Web transactions time has a red error indicator, and Application activity shows critical violations. More than that, the times that the errors occurred in both services match up (around 10:53 AM, in this example). Step 5 of 8 Web transactions time, in APM, shows that requests to the login service spend all their time in Java code. So, in the left-hand navigation, open Monitor > JVMs: Java Virtual Machines, or JVMs, run Java processes, such as those used by the login service. This view shows resource graphs for each JVM your service uses. Change the timeslice to look at data for the last 3 hours, so you can get a better idea of how the service has been behaving: Notice, in Heap memory usage, that the line for Used Heap rises consistently over 30 minute intervals. About two-thirds of the way through each interval, the line for Committed Heap (the amount of JVM heap memory dedicated for use by Java processes) quickly rises to accommodate the increasing memory demands. This graph indicates that the Java process is leaking memory. Step 6 of 8 Your Java process is leaking memory, but you need to understand the extent of the leak's impact. Navigate to the login service's host infrastructure view to dive a little deeper. First, go to the Telco-Login Service summary page and turn off Show new view: Then, scroll to the bottom of the page, and select the host's name: Right now, you can only select the host's name from the old version of the UI (we're working on it). So, make sure you toggle off Show new view. In this infrastructure view, Memory Used % for Telco-Authentication-host consistently climbs from around 60% to around 90% over 30-minute intervals, matching the intervals in the JVM's heap memory usage graph: Therefore, the memory leak effects the login service's entire host. Click and drag on Memory Used % to narrow the timeslice to one of the peaks: Now, compare this graph with the login service's Errors graph to see how they relate. Step 7 of 8 Open New Relic in a new tab. From APM, select Telco-Login Service. Then, navigate to Events > Errors. By comparing these graphs, you see that the memory percentage reached its peak at 10:25 AM (in this example) and then dropped off. You also see that errors started occurring in the login service just after that, at 10:26 AM. The message for those errors is the same one you saw earlier: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic This suggests that the memory leaks cause the application to fail for a time. To understand the error a bit more, select the error class from the table at the bottom of the view: The stack trace shows that the service raised an UnhandledException from a function called EnsureAppIsStarted: With the information you've collected so far, you can conclude that Telco-Login Service's Java code has a memory leak. Also, the login service restarts the application when it runs out of memory, and it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests while the app is restarting. You also know the login service is effecting the web portal, because that is what introduced you to this problem, but does the issue effect any other services? Step 8 of 8 Visualize service dependencies using service maps. First, navigate back to APM, and from Telco-Login Service, select Monitor > Service map: Both Telco-Web Portal and Telco-Warehouse Portal depend on Telco-Login Service. So, when the login service goes down, you start seeing errors in both portals. Extra Credit Use the same steps you used to investigate issues in the web portal to confirm there are issues in the warehouse portal. Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal raise alerts during critical violations The login service's Java processes leak memory When the login service's host, Telco-Authentication-host, runs out of memory, it restarts the login application While the login application is restarting, it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests When the web portal and the warehouse portal make requests to the login service while it's restarting, they receive errors and raise errors of their own Now, as a Telco Lite developer, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the memory leak. Congratulations! Learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABlE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "With the data explorer you can navigate all your data visually, without any NRQL knowledge. Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces query interfaces to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From the data explorer you can access the query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Install and configure the New Relic One CLI, before starting this one. A Nerdpack is a package that contains all the files that make up a New Relic One application or visualization. Nerdpacks include files for metadata, Nerdlets, assets, and more. To create a Nerdpack, use the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack When nr1 prompts for a component name, use \"ab-test\" and watch the tool create the foundations of your Nerdpack. Once it's finished, explore the files it created for you. Root directory At the root level, you have a directory called ab-test. Everything inside this directory is part of the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls ab-test README.md nerdlets nr1.json package.json launchers node_modules package-lock.json Readme.md provides instructions for creating Nerdpack elements and serving your application locally. This and nr1 --help are useful if you forget how to interact with your Nerdpack using the command line tool. Javascript files package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules are important for running your JavaScript application, but aren't unique to Nerdpacks. You can learn about these modules from JavaScript courses should you need to tweak them. For now, take a look at nr1.json, one of the most relevant files in this directory. Metadata file nr1.json is the Nerdpack's metadata file, containing a schema type, unique identifier, a display name, and a description. Since you’re building a New Relic One application for running and analyzing A/B tests, update the package's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and set the description to \"A/B test your application using New Relic One\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"311bcd0c-f7eb-4285-afed-4219179bf91d\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"A/B test your application using New Relic One.\" } nr1.json Copy It's good to describe your application's purpose, especially if you're going to publish your application for others to use. Next, look at the launchers and nerdlets subdirectories. Launchers launchers is a directory because you can create multiple launchers for your New Relic One application. nr1 create only created one launcher for your Nerdpack and called it \"ab-test-launcher\". Inside its directory, there are two files: icon.png is an image that represents the application nr1.json is the launcher's metadata file Use \"A/B Test Launcher\" for the launcher's displayName and \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\" for the description in nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"ab-test-launcher\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test Launcher\", \"description\": \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\" } launchers/ab-test-launcher/nr1.json Copy Notice that the launcher has a rootNerdletId. This identifies the Nerdlet that the launcher opens when it's selected. This Nerdpack has only one Nerdlet, called ab-test-nerdlet, but some Nerdpacks may have multiple. Make sure that you set the rootNerdletId to the Nerdlet you want the launcher to open. Nerdlets The nerdlets directory contains all the Nerdlets that make up your New Relic One application. Since ab-test-nerdlet is the only Nerdlet in this Nerdpack, there is only one subdirectory. In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, there are three files: index.js is the JavaScript file that contains your Nerdlet component styles.scss holds the Sass stylesheet for your Nerdlet nr1.json contains the Nerdlet's metadata Update your Nerdlet's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and description to \"Control and view results of your A/B test\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"Control and view results of your A/B test\" } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Now, you've customized your Nerdpack, Nerdlet, and launcher with informative display names and descriptions, but what does your application actually do? Check out index.js to see what your default Nerdlet looks like: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, ab-test-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you have AbTestNerdletNerdlet, which nr1 created for you. It's a React component that renders a first-level welcome heading. Because this is the root Nerdlet, as specified in your launcher's nr1.json file, when you click on your launcher in the New Relic platform, the launcher will open a view that displays this heading. Tip In this lesson, you used nr1 create to create a Nerdpack, complete with a launcher and a Nerdlet. If you want to create another Nerdlet or Launcher in your Nerdpack, you can also do that with nr1 create: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdlet $ nr1 create --type launcher You can even skip the --type flag and select an option from a list: bash Copy $ nr1 create ? What kind of component do you want to create? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit. nerdpack ❯ nerdlet - create a/an Nerdlet Nerdpack item inside your Nerdpack. launcher catalog visualization In the next lesson, you'll learn how to serve your Nerdpack locally and see your app in action!

      "body": "If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin Before you begin, we recommend first reading about permissions. To start building, you must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how.

Gain extensive visibility into each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected. Use the New Relic Navigator to give you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And use the New Relic Lookout to spot entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Provide context for your entities. Add tags to all your entities. Or create tags for teams and all the services they monitor. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. See how each part of your system is connected. Service maps illustrate your upstream and downstream dependencies. Visualize the aggregated health and activity data from all you monitor. Group and monitor any entities together into functional team-focused, project-focused groupings, or any other attribute, with workloads. Fetch and analyze specific data. Get more context while you query with the query builder, which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Find a service or dashboard in a complex environment. Search by name across all accounts in the unified search, or filter the explorer by tags or text. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. View a list of all the dependencies for a service. The dependencies view tab in an entity summary shows all the dependencies of the entity you’re viewing. Track activity as it moves across your distributed system.

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Incident Intelligence events One billing factor is how many incident events your organization sends to Incident Intelligence for correlation and analysis. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, Incident Intelligence comes with a certain number of free incident events per month. (Our original pricing plan doesn't have a free tier.) You can track usage and cost in two places in the UI: In the usage UI From the Incident Intelligence system settings UI page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, then click Incident Intelligence, and then click System settings. Determine event source When you set up Incident Intelligence data sources, the incident events ingested by those sources are what count towards your total. To see the sources affecting your billing, go to the Sources page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, click Incident Intelligence, and then click Sources. Stop reporting events Go to the Incident Intelligence Sources UI page and disconnect all the sources you don’t want. If all sources are removed, no data is sent to Incident Intelligence. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we're upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Features You can scroll down to the transition details, but first here are some features we've added that show how New Relic One dashboards are a clear improvement over Insights dashboards. Improved query abilities With New Relic One, you get: Ability to query many accounts from the same widget: New Relic One lets you query across all your associated accounts in one place. Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. Learn how to browse and query data in New Relic. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL query. Improved visualizations Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. Facet linking: You can filter your dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. There's also support for cases. Learn more. More charts or widgets in an area: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience. Join us and make the switch to New Relic One! Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps The Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs In July of 2021, the Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated and replaced with NerdGraph functionality. For more on this change, and tips on how to migrate, see NerdGraph API for dashboards. Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you.",

      "body": "You can generate metric-type data from other types of data in New Relic, including events, logs, and spans. Metrics are aggregates of your data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods. This document explains: Reasons to use this feature Available operations How to use our NerdGraph API tool to perform operations Why create metrics from other data types? Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage. This in turn allows you to query your data and build charts more easily. The difference between metrics and other types of data in New Relic is based on time. For more information, see Understand data types. Events, logs, spans: These types of data represent a single record at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your events, logs, or spans. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you can aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this information month over month. Why use metrics? Comments Flexibility Metrics are dimensional. You can choose what metadata (like host name or app name) is attached to them. Common metric measurements, like average, sum, minimum, and maximum, are already calculated. Data aggregation and retention The data has already been pre-aggregated into longer-period time buckets. Data retention is 13 months. Query capabilities You can query using the Metric data type. When you create metrics, this does not delete your events or other types of data. However, metrics are better for longer-range querying and charting. To get started converting your data to metrics, create a rule. Available operations To show, create, and delete rules for generating metrics from events, logs, or spans, use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. These operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing metrics rules). All operations are role-based in NerdGraph as the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics include: Create a rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule The method being called to delete a rule. deletes This takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Example response for the request: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsDeleteRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"id\": \"12\", \"name\": \"Test Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } Copy Enable or disable a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To enable or disable an existing rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics, use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation. The only difference is whether enabled is set to true or false. Example request to enable an existing metrics rule: mutation { eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsUpdateRule The method being called to update an existing rule and either enable it or disable it. updates This takes three required parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. enabled: To enable a disabled rule, set this to true. To disable a rule, set this to false. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Queries Query operations include: List all rules for a New Relic account You can list all rules in a New Relic account or return a specific rule. Example listing all rules for account 123456: query { actor { account(id:123456) { eventsToMetrics{ allRules{ rules{ id name enabled nrql description } } } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description query One of the basic API operation types. Used to query but not make changes. actor This specifies the current New Relic user. account(id: 123456) Specify the ID for the New Relic account where to retrieve data. eventsToMetrics Scope the data only for events-to-metrics, logs-to-metrics, or spans-to-metrics rules. allRules Returns all rules for that account. rules In the rules block, you can define what data you want returned. Available fields include: id name description nrql accountId enabled Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"allRules\": { \"rules\": [ { \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" }, { \"description\": \"Metric for duration\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"Duration Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy List rule by rule ID If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now you want to list its contents so you can review it. Example listing rule 36 for New Relic account 123456: query { actor { account(id: 123456) { eventsToMetrics { rulesById(ruleIds: \"36\") { rules { id name enabled nrql description accountId } } } } } } Copy For more details about the elements in this query, see List all rules. Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"rulesById\": { \"rules\": [ { \"accountId\": 123456, \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"36\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool You can use our GraphiQL tool to explore the data structure. You can also use it to build and run the operations to convert events, logs, and spans to metrics. To use this tool: Create the metrics operation's request with the required parameters. Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql, and paste your query into the box. To execute the operation, press Play. Or, to get the cURL format, select Copy as cURL.) Validate the response in the response box. Optional: To verify that your rule-creation operation was performed successfully, run a list query for that rule ID.",

Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and any Log_<value> custom data partition created Metric group: LoggingBytes Log records are stored into the Log event type by default. Additional custom data partitions will create new event types, which are always prefixed with Log_ and will be counted as part of the overall set of log data stored. With LogExtendedRecord, log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. As of September 2021, log storage as blobs replaces LogExtendedRecord. With blob storage, NRDB can store up to 128,000 bytes for any attribute, not just messages. For more information, see our blobs documentation for logs. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent. You are not charged for DistributedTraceSummary events. Browser:EventLog Browser Browser:JSErrors PcvPerf (PageView timing) Browser events Metric group: BrowserEventsBytes Lambda Serverless Metric group: ServerlessBytes Break down data to see what's contributing to your ingest You can inspect your data ingest to gain more information about your ingest health. This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

      "body": "Use New Relic's metrics API service to define rules for creating metrics from your other types of data, such as events, logs, or spans. Recommendation: Before you begin, review our requirements and tips for creating rules. Create a metrics rule To create a rule for creating metrics from events, logs, or spans: Construct the metrics rule using NRQL. Construct a NerdGraph (GraphQL format) API request that contains your NRQL rule. Create the metric by making the API request. Once a metric is created, you can query and chart it using NRQL. Step 1. Create NRQL query rule The most important part of creating a metrics rule is constructing the NRQL query that defines the metric for your data from events, logs, or spans. You can create up to 10 metrics with a single NRQL query by following this procedure: Using New Relic's NRQL interface, construct a query for the metric you want to create. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT average(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy Edit the query to use one of the three available metric types: summary: Use if the query's function is min, max, sum, count, or average. uniqueCount: Use if the query's function is uniqueCount. distribution: Use if the query's function is percentile or histogram. This example query uses average, so use summary: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary (ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy This example query uses count on a non-numeric field: FROM ProcessSample SELECT count(hostname) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy For summary on a non-numeric field use summary(1): FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(1) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy Tip For more detailed information on using these metric types in rules, see Creating metric rules: requirements and tips. Decide on the attributes you want to attach to the metric, following the limits on the cardinality of unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations. Recommendation: Run a separate query to ensure this count isn't over 50,000 for a 24-hour window. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT uniqueCount(awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy To be able to aggregate and filter your metrics, add the attributes you want to attach to the metric using the FACET clause. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Set the name of the metric using the AS function. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Once your NRQL rule is complete, use it to create the API request. Step 2. Create API request After you build the NRQL rule to convert data from events, logs, or spans to metrics, continue with building the API request. You can use our NerdGraph API tool to explore the data structure and to construct and make your request. To check that the rule was created correctly, you can run a query to return that rule using its ID. For tips on querying the metrics you've created, see Query and chart your metrics. Example NerdGraph API request The following example NerdGraph API request uses the same NRQL rule from step 1. The IO Total Read Bytes Rule creates a metric named io.totalread.bytes. (The rule name can have spaces, which differs from the metric naming rules.) mutation { eventsToMetricsCreateRule(rules: { name: \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", description:\"Created by Zach on March 27, 2019. Used by team Network.\", nrql:\"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\", accountId: 123456 }) { successes { id name nrql enabled } failures { submitted { name nrql accountId } errors { reason description } } } } Copy In this request: Request elements Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsCreateRule The method being called to create a rule. rules Takes four parameters: name: The name of the rule. description: Optional. The description of the rule. We recommend you include information about who created the metric data and who will be using the data. accountId: The New Relic account ID where the events, logs, or spans live and the metrics will be created. nrql: The NRQL query that creates the rule. For more on this, see Create NRQL query. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a successful or failed response. Available parameters for these blocks include: id (ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled (enabled/disabled status) accountId ruleId and accountId If a failure occurs, then the submitted ruleId and accountId will be returned along with the error reason and error description. Example NerdGraph API response Here's an example of a returned response: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsCreateRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"46\", \"name\": \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", \"nrql\": \"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\" } ] } } } Copy Step 3. Create a metrics rule with API request When your API request is ready, you can use the NerdGraph API to make the request, which will create the metrics. Query and chart your metrics After you create a metrics rule to convert data for your events, logs, or spans, you can view the new metric data in the New Relic UI. To view your data: Go to New Relic's NRQL query interface. Run the following query to see the name of all your metrics: SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric Copy Pick the metric of interest, then run the following query to see the available attributes: SELECT * FROM Metric where metricName = 'yourMetric' Copy If you don't see expected data, follow the troubleshooting procedures. The available NRQL aggregator functions depend on the metric type you created. Here are some examples. Summary metric example If you created a summary metric type, you can use the count, sum, max, min, and average aggregator functions, as shown in the following query: SELECT count(appStartResponseTime), sum(appStartResponseTime), max(appStartResponseTime), min(appStartResponseTime), average(appStartResponseTime) FROM Metric Copy Count metric example If you created a uniqueCount metric type, you can only use the uniqueCount function, as shown in the following query: SELECT uniqueCount(playbackErrorStreamUniqueCount) * 100 / uniqueCount(streamUniqueCount) AS '% of Streams Impacted' FROM Metric Copy Distribution metric example If you created a distribution metric type, use the percentile or histogram functions, as shown in the following queries: SELECT percentile(service.responseTime, 95) FROM Metric Copy OR SELECT histogram(service.responseTime, 10, 20) FROM Metric Copy Troubleshooting If your NerdGraph call is not constructed correctly, you may receive a message like this: Cannot parse the unexpected character \"\\u201C” Copy Verify the quotes in the NerdGraph call are not smart quotes (curly quotes). Our NerdGraph API only accepts straight quotes.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Incident Intelligence events One billing factor is how many incident events your organization sends to Incident Intelligence for correlation and analysis. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, Incident Intelligence comes with a certain number of free incident events per month. (Our original pricing plan doesn't have a free tier.) You can track usage and cost in two places in the UI: In the usage UI From the Incident Intelligence system settings UI page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, then click Incident Intelligence, and then click System settings. Determine event source When you set up Incident Intelligence data sources, the incident events ingested by those sources are what count towards your total. To see the sources affecting your billing, go to the Sources page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, click Incident Intelligence, and then click Sources. Stop reporting events Go to the Incident Intelligence Sources UI page and disconnect all the sources you don’t want. If all sources are removed, no data is sent to Incident Intelligence. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month).

      "body": "Understanding how high cardinality works is important, because it can impact how quickly you reach your data limits. What is cardinality and why does it matter? Cardinality is generally defined as the number of elements in a set. For dimensional metrics, the set in question is the collection of unique maps of attributes observed for a given metric in a one-day period. You can query the cardinality of a metric in New Relic with the following NRQL format: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(metric.name) SINCE today RAW Copy For example, to query the cardinality of the metric memory.heap and find out how many unique key-value pairs exist for this metric, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy Tip We recommend including the RAW clause in cardinality queries that use FROM Metric. This is because in the event your cardinality has been limited, queries like SINCE today will query rollups that are no longer reporting and so need to look at the raw data points to perform the necessary analysis. Note that because querying the raw data points over long time ranges can be slow, RAW queries spanning more than 2 days worth of data are not allowed. While the basics of what cardinality means can be simple to state, learning how to address and manage high cardinality can be a little more complicated. Cardinality limits and enforcement New Relic enforces limits on your metric cardinality both at the per-metric level and at the account level. Cardinality is evaluated over the course of a UTC day, starting at 00:00:00 UTC and ending at 23:59:59 UTC. For more information on data limits and related policies, see New Relic data usage limits and policies Cardinality and dimensional metrics The cardinality of a metric is the size of the set of unique maps of attributes observed for the given metric in a one-day period. If keys or values in that map change over time, they will add new cardinality for that metric. Let's see an example. Imagine a network of 4 hosts, each with 2 containers running on them, and each container periodically reports the gauge metric memory.heap, with the host name and container id added as attributes. When submitted to the Metric API, one of these metrics might look something like this: \"metrics\":[ { \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":5514, \"timestamp\":1234567890, \"attributes\":{ \"host\":\"W\", \"container\":\"1\" } } ] Copy This metric would then have a cardinality of 8, as that's how many unique mappings of host and container are possible. If a new measurement for this metric is taken with identical attributes as one that had previously reported, no new cardinality would be counted. Cardinality influences As shown above, any changes to the keys or values will represent new cardinality, but predicting how those changes will impact your total cardinality can get a little tricky. It's tempting to assume that the cardinality of a metric is then the product of the number of all possible values for each possible key, but this is rarely the case in practice, as the values a given key often depend on or determine the values of other keys. Using the previous example, once we had a container value of 1, the value of host was fixed to W, assuming those container IDs are globally unique. So while there are 8 containers across 4 hosts, the cardinality is still 8, not 4 * 8 = 32, since most combinations counted by the simple multiplication method are not possible and therefore don't contribute to that metric's cardinality. We will never see the combination of host = 'X', container = 1, for instance. This also means that adding more keys to an attributes map does not necessarily imply an increase to total cardinality. If the value of the new key is uniquely determined by the values of existing keys, it will not add new cardinality in the long term. For instance if you add something like region to your map in the example, it's likely the case that the container value is also fixed to a particular region value, and therefore keeps your cardinality at 8. An important caveat here is that while adding region won't increase the cardinality going forward, it will introduce new cardinality when it is first added. This is because adding keys will make those attribute maps distinct from any that came before them, temporarily increasing the total cardinality for that day. Examples and sample workflows If you hit one of your cardinality limits, there are a couple of options you can use to remedy the situation. One easy answer is increasing your limits, but if you would prefer not to do that, a good alternative is to explore which dimensions are contributing the most to your cardinality and think about removing them if they do not provide value. This can save storage and bandwidth costs and potentially prevent you needing to raise your limits. Find cardinality contributors: metrics Recall how to get the cardinality of a particular metric: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy For the total account cardinality, you can use the same basic query structure and simply omit the metric name: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW Copy The account's cardinality is essentially the sum of each metric's cardinality, so adding in a simple FACET query can help find the highest cardinality metrics: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW FACET metricName Copy Finally, if you believe you have hit one of your cardinality limits, you can confirm this by checking for a related NrIntegrationError: FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT count(*) where name = 'CardinalityViolationException' and newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet cardinalityLimitType, metricName, message since today Copy Finding cardinality contributors: dimensions Once you've determined a metric you want to explore, the next step is to determine which dimensions in a given metric contribute the most to its cardinality. If you are unfamiliar with the values of your dimensions, you can look at them like so: FROM Metric SELECT dimensions() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy The JSON results view will likely be advisable here. Looking through these could reveal some dimensions containing a unique ID or other highly variable value that might be worth removing. If you are already familiar with what values your attributes can take on, the keySet() results may be easier to scan: FROM Metric SELECT keySet() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy Understanding the dimensions that have the most influence on your total cardinality comes down to understanding how each key's values correlate with one another. You can experiment with what your cardinality would be without a dimension simply by adding it to the exclude list: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, exclude: {'container.id'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Likewise, there is an include list if that is more convenient to the query context: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, include: {'host.name', 'region'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Managing cardinality can be tricky to conceptualize, but the above methods will help you get answers to questions like \"What metric is contributing the most cardinality?\" and \"What impact does a given attribute(s) have to that total cardinality?\". It's often the case that cardinality tracks with the most unique value, as that value may pin down the possible values other attributes can take on. However, there are plenty of cases where the explosion of possible combinations of a handful of attributes drives the total cardinality. Things that look like unique identifiers are generally a good place to start, but sometimes it's no single key but the combination of two or more keys. The more familiar you are with your data and the systems that generate it, the easier it will be to know which attributes to include or exclude. Tip If you'd like to learn more about limits and troubleshooting the Metric API, here are two good resources: Metric API limits and restricted attributes Troubleshoot Metric API with NRIntegrationError events are both great resources to explore.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring supports the uploading of source maps, which are used to un-minify error stack traces on the JS errors page. This document explains how to use the API to publish (upload) source maps to browser. Prepare for using the source map API In order to upload source maps to browser via the API, you'll need this information: A user API key (before November 20, 2020, the Admin API key was required; that will still work if already in place) The New Relic application ID for the deployed app The full JavaScript file URL Optionally, if the JavaScript URL doesn't automatically have release info appended to it, the release name and ID What is the JavaScript URL? Every time the agent captures an error in your code, it's associated with the URL of the JavaScript in which it occurred. This is the src attribute of the script tag in your HTML. This full JavaScript URL is required when sending source maps to browser. You can find the URL for an error's JavaScript file in browser, on the JS errors page. See Browser monitoring source maps for more on finding these errors in the UI. Is a release name and ID required? Many organizations include a version number or hash in the JavaScript URL. This is generally added to \"bust\" caches to ensure your users get the most recent version of your code. This type of URL might look something like: https://example.com/assets/application-59.min.js https://example.com/assets/bundle-d6d031.min.js https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.js If your app's URLs automatically have the version info appended to it, the browser agent has everything it needs in order to match errors with your code. You can move ahead to generating source maps. If this doesn't apply to you, and JS URLs do not have version info appended, you’ll have to assist the agent by specifying a release name and ID with the API. Is a repo URL or a build commit hash required? If you're interested in connecting New Relic to your CodeStream organization when this feature is available, your repository URL or build commit hash are required. Otherwise, this is optional. If you're interested in learning more about this, you can read about how CodeStream and New Relic work together to make it easier to identify errors and collaborate on fixing them. Are there limits to source map uploads? There is no limit to the overall number of source maps you can upload. However, the API is rate-limited: You can upload a maximum of 100 source maps per minute You can upload a maximum of 5,000 source maps per day Source map files can be a maximum of 50Mb in size. Push source maps to New Relic Now that you have one or more source maps, you are ready to publish it to browser. You can use any of these methods to send source maps to browser: Use the New Relic npm module with the API via the command line or via a client-side JavaScript build/deploy script like Gulp or Grunt. Use API curl commands. Use the browser UI. Use npm module via command line or client-side script The easiest and recommended way to upload source maps to browser is to use the our new @newrelic/publish-sourcemap npm module. It provides a command line tool and Javascript API to accomplish this task. More documentation is available in the npm repo. Here are some examples of using the npm module via the command line. Important The following examples are for US accounts. For EU accounts, the endpoint is https://sourcemaps.service.eu.newrelic.com. For more information, see Introduction to the EU region data center. npm command line: Publish Here's an example of uploading source maps using the npm module via the command line.

      "body": "Publish your Nerdpack, whether it's still in development, ready for testing, or stable, to share it with others. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions When you publish your Nerdpack, it's registered with the Instant Observability catalog. From there, some users can subscribe to your Nerdpack. Subscribing users need to have: Access to the account that published the Nerdpack The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Update your package version You can only publish a package version to the Instant Observabiltiy catalog one time. For example, you can't publish two instances of version 1.0.0. So, each time you want to deploy a new version of your code, you need to increment its version in the Nerdpack's package.json file: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy Tip Nerdpack versions follow semantic versioning. Read the documentation to learn more. Generate a UUID for your Nerdpack If you built your Nerdpack from scratch with nr1 create --type nerdpack, then your Nerdpack has a unique identifier. Find this identifier in the root directory's nr1.json file: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"DemoApp\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack demo-app\" } nr1.json Copy This ID must be unique to your Nerdpack when you publish it to the catalog. The platform will reject your Nerdpack if it recognizes the ID. So, if you cloned an existing Nerdpack or are otherwise using open source code, generate a new UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --generate --force Tip Read the nr1 nerdpack:uuid documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --help Publish your Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish If you've successfully published your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This output describes the published Nerdpack. First, it states the Nerdpack's ID (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890). Then, its version (1.0.0). Finally, its version tag (STABLE). You already managed your Nerdpack's ID and version, but the version tag is new. To manage your Nerdpack's versions, you can tag them with an arbitrary tag. For example, if a version is still in development, you can tag it with a DEV tag. If the version moves to a QA phase, you can tag it with QA. If it's ready for production, you can tag it with STABLE. Tip Read our tag guide to learn more. Use the -t or --tag option to publish your Nerdpack with a tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag DEV As you saw in the nr1 nerdpack:publish output, if you don't pass a tag, nr1 applies the STABLE tag automatically. However, you can tell it to not apply any tags to a release with the -T or --skip-tag option: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --skip-tag You can also perform a dry run to make sure you publish your Nerdpack the way you want to: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --dry-run Step 2 of 4 Once you've successfully published your Nerdpack, go to New Relic: Because you're going to view a published Nerdpack, rather than a locally served one, you don't need to pass the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to Instant Observability: Whether you published a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Instant Observability. Step 4 of 4 Find your published Nerdpack using the Apps filter or search bar: Tip Only Nerdpacks with tagged versions are shown in Instant Observability. So, if you published without a tag or removed a tag from your published Nerdpack, you won't see it in the catalog. Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you publish your Nerdpack, you may come across issues. Whether you can't publish your Nerdpack due to some issue with your code or you can't find your Nerdpack in Instant Observability, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your command When you attempt to publish your Nerdpack, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. For example: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack DemoApp (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890) › Error: There is already a Nerdpack with given id & version. › Code: 409 It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --verbose Reveal your published Nerdpack information If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, it may not be tagged. Remember, at least one version of your published Nerdpack must have a tag for it to show on the Apps page. See more information about your published Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:info: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 3014918 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 3 hours ago In this example, there is one published version, but it isn't tagged. You can tag a published version with: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --from-version=1.0.0 --tag=DEV Now, if you refresh your browser page, you should see your Nerdpack on Apps. Tip Read our nr1 nerdpack:tag documentation to learn more. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you publish your Nerdpack, only users who can access your account can see your published Nerdpack. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic but you know it's published, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same.",

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you easily get StatsD-format data into New Relic. You can also add any arbitrary tags (key-value pairs) to your data. Once your metrics are in New Relic, you can query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Want to try out our StatsD integration? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements This integration uses our Metric API and our Event API to ingest data. To use these APIs, you'll need a license key. The integration adheres to the Metric API requirements and data limits. The default rate limit is 100,000 data points per minute (DPM). If you think you're missing metrics or sending more than 100K DPM, see Request data changes. To see if your account is hitting the rate limit, run the following NRQL query of the NrIntegrationError event: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' FACET category, message LIMIT 100 since 1 day ago Copy Install This section will explain how to do a standard install. If you want to run StatsD in Kubernetes, see Kubernetes install. To install the StatsD integration, run the following command and include your New Relic account ID and New Relic license key. This generates a TOML configuration file used by gostatsd. docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy If your account is in the EU data center region, add this to the above command: -e NR_EU_REGION=true \\ Copy After installing, you can: Do optional additional configuration Define your metrics Add custom tags to your data Create alerts Install for Kubernetes Here are examples of Kubernetes manifests for deployment and service objects: Kubernetes manifest examples Below are examples of Kubernetes manifests to deploy StatsD in a Kubernetes environment and create a StatsD service named newrelic-statsd. You need to insert your account ID and your license key. deployment.yml: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: selector: matchLabels: app: newrelic-statsd replicas: 2 revisionHistoryLimit: 2 template: metadata: labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: containers: - name: newrelic-statsd image: newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 env: - name: NR_ACCOUNT_ID value: \"NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID\" - name: NR_API_KEY value: \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy service.yml: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: newrelic-statsd port: 80 targetPort: 8125 protocol: UDP selector: app: newrelic-statsd Copy For configuration details, see Kubernetes configuration. Configure In the install procedure, you run nri-statsd with environment variables, and this generates a TOML configuration file. Additionally, you can set these configuration options: Configuration options Description expiry-interval string If a metric is not updated for this amount of time, we stop reporting that metric. Default is 5m. If you want to send the metrics only if the value was updated between the flush intervals, configure this to 1ms. To never expire metrics, set it to 0. percent-threshold list of integers Specifies the percentiles used for metrics aggregation. Default: 90. metrics-addr string Indicates address on which to listen for metrics. Default: :8125. Tip To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the StatsD integration you must define the following endpoints in the custom configuration: address = 'https://gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/ $NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' Copy address-metrics = 'https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' Copy Here are some examples of customizing configuration by overwriting the default configuration: Example of custom configuration # Specify after how long do we expire metrics, default:5m expiry-interval = '1ms' # percent-threshold specify a list of percentiles for metrics aggregation, default:90 percent-threshold = [90, 99] backends='newrelic' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY' Copy Disable timer sub-metrics: By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. If you want to disable those metrics you can do it by adding a disabled-sub-metrics configuration section and set true for the ones you want disabled. Here's an example: # disabled-sub-metrics configuration section allows disabling timer sub-metrics [disabled-sub-metrics] # Regular metrics count=false count-per-second=false mean=false median=false lower=false upper=false stddev=false sum=false sum-squares=false # Percentile metrics count-pct=false mean-pct=false sum-pct=false sum-squares-pct=false lower-pct=false upper-pct=false Copy Docker: overwrite default configuration To overwrite the default nri-statsd configuration while running in a container, you can mount a configuration file inside the container. You can adopt the following template as needed for your situation. Example: backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY' Copy To run the container with the file mounted in the appropriate path: docker run \\ ... -v ${PWD}/nri-statsd.toml:/etc/opt/newrelic/nri-statsd.toml \\ ... newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Kubernetes: overwrite default configuration The best approach to configure nri-statsd running in Kubernetes is to use a configMap and mount the configMap into the container. (This is a similar process to mounting the configuration file in Docker.) Example: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-statsd-config namespace: default data: nri-statsd.toml: | backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = '$NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY' Copy To use the configMap, declare a volume on your deployment spec template and then declare a volumeMount on your container spec. Example: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment spec: template: spec: containers: .... volumeMounts: - mountPath: /etc/opt/newrelic/ name: nri-statsd-config volumes: - name: nri-statsd-config configMap: name: nri-statsd-config Copy Metric format The integration receives metrics using the StatsD protocol. Optionally, the sample rate can be configured and tags can be added. Here's the metric data format we use: <metric name>:<value>|<type>|@<sample rate>|#<tags> Copy Here are explanations of these fields: Field name Description < metric name> string Required. Name of the metric. < value> string Required. The metric type: c = counter g = gauge ms = timer @ < sample rate> float Optional for simple counters or timer counters. When many metrics must be sent, you can use sampling to reduce network traffic. The downside is a reduction in the resolution of the data. An example of how this would work for sample rates below 1: If you set this to 0.1, the counter would send a measurement one out of every 10 times. # < tags> string Optional. Tags attached to your metrics are converted into attributes (key-value pairs). For more on tagging options, see Tags. Metric types Here are the types of metrics and how to format them: Counter A counter measures the number of occurrences of an event. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. A counter can be incremented or decremented during the same flush interval by adding a sign to the value. In the following example, the counter value will be 2: counter:4|c counter:-2|c Copy At each flush, the current count is sent and reset to 0. If the count is not updated, at the next flush it will send the value 0. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Here’s an example of a counter that is being sampled 1 out of 10 times: counter:4|c@0.1 Copy Gauge A gauge represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include temperature, CPU usage, and memory. Here's an example: temperature:40|g Copy If the gauge is not updated, at the next flush it will send the previous value. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Timer The timer metric type measures timing data. By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. These are sent as sub-metrics in the following format: <metric_base_name>.std_dev <metric_base_name>.median <metric_base_name>.summary <metric_base_name>.sum_squares <metric_base_name>.mean <metric_base_name>.per_second Copy The configured percentiles will generate the following metrics. The percentile threshold value will be attached as a tag. <metric_base_name>.sum_squares.percentiles <metric_base_name>.sum.percentiles <metric_base_name>.count.percentiles <metric_base_name>.upper.percentiles <metric_base_name>.mean.percentiles Copy The percentile threshold can be tweaked with the percent-threshold config option. These can be controlled through the disabled-sub-metrics configuration section. Add tags (attributes) You can add tags to your data, which we save as attributes (key-value pairs). There are two options for adding tags: Add default tags that apply to all metrics: These apply to all metrics. They are fixed and don't change over time. Add metric-level tags: These apply to specific metrics and allow the value to be changed between two submits. Add default tags that apply to all metrics Add tags to metrics and events by defining an environment variable in the startup command. Here's an example that would create two tags: -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" Copy Here's that environment variable used in the startup command: docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Add metric-level tags When defining the metric format, you can add tags using this format: <bucket name>:<value>|<type>|#<tags> Copy In this example, <tags> is a comma-separated list of tags. Tags format is: simple or key:value. Here's an example NRQL query that includes a custom tag: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE environment = 'production' Copy Create alerts You can alert on StatsD data using NRQL alert conditions. Alert example This procedure walks you through sending some sample data and then creating an alert condition using that data. First, send this data to New Relic’s StatsD container: echo \"prod.test.num:32|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Next, create a NRQL alert condition using this query: SELECT latest(prod.test.num) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'prod.test.num' Copy Here's an image showing creating this NRQL alert condition. Notice that the sample data sent in is represented by the blue dot on the upper right of the chart. Now we can create the alert condition with these settings: When you create the NRQL alert condition, be sure to set the Condition name. If a metric with a value above 50 is sent, then an incident is created and notified. The incident is closed automatically after 24 hours. To test that the alert is working, run this command: echo \"prod.test.num:60|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Find and use data To query your data, you'd use any New Relic query option. For example, you might run a NRQL query like: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'myMetric' and environment = 'production' Copy For more on how to query the Metric data type, see Query metric data. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

      "body": "Subscribe to a Nerdpack to use it in the New Relic platform. Unsubscribe from Nerdpacks you no longer use. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions To subscribe to a Nerdpack, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can subscribe to them: Publish your Nerdpack Tag your Nerdpack if it's published and doesn't yet have a tag Subscribe to a Nerdpack Subscribe to a published Nerdpack, with either the web UI or the nr1 CLI, to use it in your account. Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Instant Observability: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack using the apps filter or search bar: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the Instant Observability catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel. Tip nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:unset. Read the nr1 subscription:unset documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:unset --help Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you subscribe to a Nerdpack, you may run into issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version If you already had the CLI, update it: bash Copy $ nr1 update Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start.

      "info": "Intro to New Relic One SDK",
      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: allows you to configure your Nerdlet and write to your Nerdlet's URL state.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One Apps overlay. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add a new configuration option Step 1 of 8 In your visualization's nr1.json file, add an enum configuration object for selectedChart: index.js nr1.json 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 Radar: 'radar', 24 Treemap: 'treemap', 25 }; 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

Step 3 of 8 Serve your Nerdpack locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve If you're still serving your Nerdpack from the last lesson, you need to stop it with CTRL-X and serve it again to reflect changes to nr1.json. Step 4 of 8 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The nerdpacks=local query string directs the UI to load your visualization from the local server. Step 5 of 8 Open the Apps page: Step 6 of 8 Go to Custom Visualizations, which is favorited by default: Step 7 of 8 In Custom Visualizations, find and click your visualization: Step 8 of 8 Notice the new Select chart configuration option: Selecting a chart type doesn't effect your visualization. This is because you first need to introduce the selectedChart property to the visualization component. Then, you use selectedChart to determine the chart type to render. Replace your SegmentedControl with the configurable property Step 1 of 5 Open your visualization's index.js file. You'll be working here for the rest of the guide.

      "body": "In your application, you can display data in charts, like those used elsewhere in New Relic's user interface. The New Relic One SDK provides React components for different chart types. Once you decide the kind of data you want to present, either from New Relic or some other source, you supply that data to your chart, using props. Query New Relic data In some cases, you want to fetch data from New Relic's database. For example, you may want to display a line chart which plots the number of transactions your application receives over time. With your chart component, set the accountId and query props to query your New Relic data using NRQL: <LineChart accountId={1234} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" />; Copy Alternatively, you can fetch data with a NrqlQuery and set the data prop: <NrqlQuery accountId={1234} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\"> {({ data }) => <LineChart data={data} />} </NrqlQuery>; Copy If you're looking to visualize New Relic data, such as your web application's response times or your server's throughput, querying data in your charts is the way to go. But what if you want to create charts that aren't focused on New Relic data? The data prop is flexible enough that you can supply any arbitrary data, as long as it matches the standardized format. Craft custom data Whether you use custom data sets or the results of a NrqlQuery, a chart's data prop must be an array of objects where each object has both of the following fields: metadata: Defines how the chart presents its data data: An array of data points that appear on the chart For example, create a chart consisting of a line between two points by supplying two x-y coordinates in its data field: const data = [ { metadata: { id: 'series-1', name: 'My series', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0, }, { x: 20, y: 10, }, ], }, ]; <LineChart data={data} />; Copy This LineChart plots a line between coordinates (0, 0) and (20, 10). Use x-y coordinates for all two-dimensional chart formats. For other formats, which you'll learn more about later, use other types of data points. Because data accepts an array, you can supply two series to the same chart: const data = [ { metadata: { id: 'series-1', name: 'My series', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0, }, { x: 20, y: 10, }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'series-2', name: 'My second series', viz: 'main', color: 'red', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 50, }, { x: 20, y: 100, }, ], }, ]; <LineChart data={data} />; Copy In this example, you create a single chart with two series. The first series contains the line from the last example. The second series contains a line between points (0, 50) and (20, 100). When using two series in a single chart, like this, you may want to define how the chart represents each series. Use metadata to define those elements. Metadata A series's metadata defines certain features of the series, itself, such as how it should be displayed in your chart. metadata consists of the following attributes: Attribute Description id The series's identifier. Two series having the same id are considered the same series, regardless of where they are located. In general, use a unique id for each series. However, if you use the same series for multiple charts, keeping the id consistent can help with some cross-chart functionality, like simultaneously highlighting multiple charts. name The series's name. name is used in legends, tooltips, and other areas to indicate which series you’re looking at. color The series's color. Most visualizations use this value to differentiate series. Some visualizations, like BillboardChart or JsonChart, ignore it. Use any valid CSS color representation, such as #RRGGBB, hsl(HHH, SS%, LL%), or rgba(RR, GG, BB, .AA). Avoid tweaking the alpha value, when possible, because charts use alpha to highlight or dim certain series. viz The series's visual style. While you most often use main, this field accepts several options: main: Show the series based on chart's type. For instance, a LineChart shows the series as a line, and an AreaChart shows the series as an area. line: Show the series as a line, regardless of the chart's type. This setting applies only to AreaChart and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. area: Show the series as an area, regardless of the chart's type. This setting applies only to LineChart and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. event: Show the series as an event, regardless of the chart's type. Charts represent an event as a vertical area behind the main visualization. Events are often used to show alerts. This setting applies only to AreaChart, LineChart, and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. target-line: Show the series as a vertical line. This setting applies only to AreaChart, LineChart, and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. units_data You can assign a unit type to each axis on a chart. The chart will present data according to the unit type you set with units_data. To set unit_data, pass a JSON object with maps the axis to one of the following unit types: UNKNOWN: The chart displays the series with no special units. COUNT: Each value in the chart represents a count. The chart formats values with their International System prefix. For example, \"k\" represents thousands, \"M\" represents millions, and \"G\" represents billions. PERCENTAGE: Each value in the chart represents a percentage. Typically, you provide values ranging from 0 to 1. The chart formats a value of 1 as \"100%\", a value of 2 as \"200%\", and a value of 0.01 as \"1%\". MS: Each value in the chart represents some number of milliseconds. The chart represents values higher than 1 as a human-readable time duration. For example, 60000 is represented as \"1 minute\". The chart represents values lower than 1 using SI prefixes. For example, 0.001 is represented as 1 μs. TIMESTAMP: Each value in the chart represents a timestamp, the number milliseconds since midnight UTC on January 1, 1970, the UNIX Epoch. The chart formats each value as a date. BITS: Each value in the chart represents some number of bits. The chart formats these values using \"b\". When upscaling, the chart will display decimal prefixes instead of binary ones. For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kb\". BITS_PER_SECOND: Each value in the chart represents some number of bits per second. The chart formats these values using \"b/s\". When upscaling, the chart will display decimal prefixes instead of binary ones. For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kb/s\". BYTES: Each value in the chart represents some number of bytes. The chart formats these values using \"B\". For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kB\". BYTES_PER_SECOND: Each value in the chart represents some number of bytes per second. The chart formats these values using \"B/s\". For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kB/s\". So, to represent the y-axis for your series in bits, set the y-value in units_data: { \"units_data\": { \"y\": \"BITS\" } } Data While a data series can contain any arbitrary values, a chart only uses values which adhere to its type. So, create your data points according to the chart type: Series Type Example Description Unidimensional [{ \"y\": 10 }, { \"y\": 20 }] The chart plots data points using y values. Use this format with BarChart, BillboardChart, PieChart, StackedBarChart. Two-dimensional [ { \"x\": 10, \"y\": 20 }, { \"x\": 20, \"y\": 30 } ] The chart plots data points using x and y values. Use this format with AreaChart, LineChart, ScatterChart, SparklineChart, Funnel [{ \"label1\": 10, \"label2\": 20 }] The chart plots data according to labels. Use this format with FunnelChart. Table [{ \"jobType\": \"SIMPLE\", \"count\": 18 }] The chart plots data according to table columns. You must specify table columns in the metadata. Use this format with TableChart. Event [ { \"x0\": 0, \"x1\": 5 }, { \"x0\": 10, \"x1\": 15 } ] The chart plots the event's width based on x0 and x1 values. Histogram [ { \"x0\": 10, \"x1\": 20, \"y\": 100 }, { \"x0\": 30, \"x1\": 40, \"y\": 150 } ] The chart plots the series's width based on x0 and x1 and height based on y. Use this format with HistogramChart and HeatmapChart. Tip JsonChart is a special case because it processes any valid data. For example, you can set an arbitrary JSON object for the chart's data: const data = { data: [ { id: 1, name: 'Foo', price: 123, tags: ['Bar', 'Eek'], stock: { warehouse: 300, retail: 20, } } ], } <JsonChart data={data} /> Copy Special States In previous sections, you learned that a chart's data is an array of series. But you can use special values to present special chart states: null or undefined: Indicates the chart is “loading” its data. In this state, the chart shows a placeholder data set. []: Indicates there is no data to show. The chart states, \"No chart data available\". Configure your chart As you've seen, you use query or data to supply data to your chart, but you can configure other aspects of your chart, too, such as visual settings and click and hover event listeners. Read the documentation for the chart you're using for more specific information. Chart Groups Under some circumstances, you might want to synchronize events, such as dragging or scrubbing, across multiple charts. To do this, use a ChartGroup. All charts in a ChartGroup synchronize their events: <ChartGroup> <Stack> <StackItem> <LineChart accountId={1} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago\" /> </StackItem> <StackItem> <AreaChart accountId={1} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Synthetics SINCE 1 day ago\" /> </StackItem> </Stack> </ChartGroup>; Copy Ideally, group charts that are conceptually related, and separate charts that are conceptually unrelated. Next Step Read the documentation specific to the chart you'd like to use to learn specifics about that chart's behavior and configuration.",

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization! In this guide, you learned how to: Create a visualization Serve your visualization locally Iterate on visualization code changes and customizations in Custom Visualizations Publish your visualization Subscribe to your visualization Add your visualization to a dashboard Additional resources New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes)",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

      "body": "New Relic One is the platform that gives you access to core platform capabilities like querying data and building charts, our more curated observability UI experiences features, and our alerting and Applied Intelligence tools. With New Relic One, you can see and act on all the data throughout your entire system. To access New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com. Or, if you report data to the EU data center go to one.eu.newrelic.com. Tip Learn more about New Relic One’s basic UI features. Quickly understand context We provide multiple ways to understand your system's dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems. New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity! If you want to... Use this Have an overall view of your system, and drill down to get performance details. Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the entities (that is, all applications, services, hosts, or containers) in your system. Gain extensive visibility into each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected. Use the New Relic Navigator to give you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And use the New Relic Lookout to spot entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Provide context for your entities. Add tags to all your entities. Or create tags for teams and all the services they monitor. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. See how each part of your system is connected. Service maps illustrate your upstream and downstream dependencies. Visualize the aggregated health and activity data from all you monitor. Group and monitor any entities together into functional team-focused, project-focused groupings, or any other attribute, with workloads. Fetch and analyze specific data. Get more context while you query with the query builder, which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Find a service or dashboard in a complex environment. Search by name across all accounts in the unified search, or filter the explorer by tags or text. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. View a list of all the dependencies for a service. The dependencies view tab in an entity summary shows all the dependencies of the entity you’re viewing. Track activity as it moves across your distributed system. Distributed tracing helps you analyze your modern environment. Understand how everything is connected via API. The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer manages all your entities, tags, and relationships. Query your data more easily On the Browse data menu on the top navigation menu you can easily access your basic telemetry data (metrics, events, logs, and traces). Wherever you go in the UI, Query your data is available. No matter your level of proficiency with our query language, you can create custom queries and charts: Browse your data in a query-less experience with our data explorer. Use your NRQL (our query language) expertise to build custom charts in the query builder. Run PromQL-style queries in the query builder. one.newrelic.com > Query your data: Build NRQL and PROMQL-like queries. Enhanced dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Quickly create information dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One. New Relic One dashboards let you build better visualizations more easily, with more options to customize. Dashboard features include: Perform NRQL queries and create charts and dashboards everywhere in the platform using the query builder. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our agents, integrations, and APIs. Share dashboards or charts as a .pdf, or embed a chart in an external site. Tip If you previously used New Relic Insights to create dashboards, these are available as New Relic One dashboards. Build on New Relic One If custom charts and dashboards don't solve your current challenge, we give you a framework for building React JavaScript applications that: Live on New Relic One, alongside your other New Relic-monitored data. Feature highly tailored visualizations. Display data from any source you want, whether from a New Relic-monitored entity or data from any service or API. And you can use open source apps built by the community, and contribute your own open source apps. To learn more, see New Relic One applications. What’s next? To get started understanding how to get around in New Relic One: See what data you have available with the data explorer. Browse your monitored entities with the New Relic Explorer.

      "body": "Our REST API (v2) allows you to configure settings for alerts. The API Explorer also includes the curl request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. You can also create alert conditions in the UI. Important For infrastructure alerting, see REST API for infrastructure monitoring alerts. Available data and functions via API REST API functions Comments View account data In general, any role can use a user key or REST API key with GET > List functions to view alerts data. The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for Synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new policies To add new policies, use your user key and include these two values in the API call: Required values Definition Incident incident_preference Determines how Alerts will create incidents and group violations. This must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name The policy name is required. Leaving it unchanged will create a policy called string.

You'll need your user key. Required values Definition id Required. To find a policy's ID, use either of these options: From the UI: On a policy's UI page, find the ID under the policy name. With the API: Use the List policies API. Incident incident_preference Determines how alerts will create incidents and group violations. Must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name Required. If you do not change the name, it defaults to a policy called string. To find a policy's exact name, use the List policies API.

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] }, \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

In this guide, you learn how to: Use the nr1 CLI to generate a default visualization Run your visualization locally where you can quickly test and iterate Publish your visualization to the New Relic One catalog Add your visualization to a dashboard Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create a new visualization Use nr1 to generate the boilerplate for a new visualization. Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called my-awesome-visualization, in a Nerdpack, called my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name my-awesome-visualization ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ... my-awesome-nerdpack ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-awesome-nerdpack is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization my-awesome-visualization is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another. Step 4 of 4 In index.js, change your component's Radar.fillOpacity: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 } from 'recharts'; 10 import {Card, CardBody, HeadingText, NrqlQuery, Spinner, AutoSizer} from 'nr1'; 11 12 export default class MyAwesomeVisualizationVisualization extends React.Component { 13 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 14 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One Apps overlay. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github.

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One Apps overlay. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type.

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Fetch data from a third-party service, before starting this one. In this course, you're building a New Relic One application. This application shows telemetry data from a demo service that is running an A/B test so that it can reveal that data in charts, like a dashboard. Your New Relic application is different than a dashboard, however, because it does more than show New Relic data. It pulls external data, provides UI components and functionality, and even has its own small data stores. The purpose of this New Relic application is to present context so you can better understand the A/B test results and how those results tie in to your business objectives. So far, you've built all your charts, organized them for improved usability, provided them with real data, and more. There are some final improvements you can make, using Platform API components. In this lesson, you learn how to use values in the New Relic platform state. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-platform-state-context/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, add a PlatformStateContext.Consumer to your NewsletterSignups component's render() method: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Notice that NrqlQuery uses a constant called ACCOUNT_ID. Instead of hardcoding an account identifier in your Nerdlet, you can use accountId from the platform URL state. Step 3 of 10 PlatformStateContext.Consumer provides access to the platform's URL state. This context contains an important value you'll use in your app, called timeRange. Notice that your NrqlQuery uses a SINCE clause that identifies the historical timeframe your query should fetch data from. Right now, that SINCE clause is set to 30 MINUTES AGO. With timeRange, you can use the platform's time picker to make this timeframe adjustable. Step 4 of 10 Utilize the platform state's timeRange: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, NewsletterSignups uses platformState.timeRange instead of a hardcoded SINCE clause. While NrqlQuery components accept a convenient timeRange prop, not every component does. You can still use timeRange in other contexts by accessing duration, begin_time, or end_time: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { console.log(platformState.timeRange.duration); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>; Copy Step 5 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test. Step 6 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 7 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 10 View your application: Your NrqlQuery now uses the platform state's timeRange, but your chart probably still shows the last 30 minutes. Why? Where does the timeRange in platform state come from? The time picker sits on the right side of your application's navigation bar: Change this value and see your chart update: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 9 of 10 Update VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Of all the charts in your New Relic One application, these three charts are the ones that should update with the time picker. The others, Total subscriptions per version, Total cancellations per version, Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions, Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, show total values over time. So, hardcoding their SINCE clauses to 7 DAYS AGO makes sense, as this is a reasonable time period for the purposes of this course. Step 10 of 10 While still serving your Nerdpack locally, view your NR1 app to see your charts updating with the time range you choose: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now that you're basing your queries off the platform state, some of your charts are dynamic in their time ranges. This is a great improvement because it allows you to adjust your charts to show data from any particular point in time, which is useful for tying data to business outcomes. The Platform API components offer a lot more functionality, too, including the ability to navigate the user to another place in New Relic. You'll learn how to do this in the next lesson.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorage from your nerdlet, before starting this one. Throughout this course, you're building a New Relic One application that gathers telemetry data from a demo web service that's running an A/B test on a newsletter signup form. The purpose of your New Relic One application is to help you understand how design changes impact the number of high quality newsletter subscriptions your service gets. The business objective, to increase your service's high quality newsletter subscriptions, relies primarily on three key pieces of information: Number of page views per version Number of subscriptions per version Number of cancellations Cancellations are important because if one design version of your newsletter signup form results in a high number of subscriptions but also a high number of cancellations, then those subscriptions are not as valuable. In previous lessons, you gathered data for page views and subscriptions from New Relic's database (NRDB), but you still need cancellation data. Your demo application does not report cancellation data to New Relic, so you need to fetch that data from an external source. We've provided a service at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations to return fake cancellation data for the purposes of this course. If you visit this URL in your browser, you'll see a brief message: \"Unauthorized\". This is because we created this service with a requirement that whoever requests its data must pass an Authorization header with the bearer token ABC123. So before you can request cancellation data from api.nerdsletter.net, you need to implement a few new behaviors in your application: Provide a mechanism for inputting an authorization token Persist the authorization token in a secure data store To input your authorization token, you'll use a Modal with a TextField. The secure data store you'll use is called NerdStorageVault. It's different from NerdStorage, which you used in the last lesson, because it only supports user storage and encrypts its data. Store your API token Step 1 of 3 Change to the add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 3 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, initialize state in AbTestNerdletNerdlet with a null token default: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Your Nerdlet uses this token state to manage the authorization token you'll later pass to the third-party service. However, a component's state is not a long-term solution for data management. For that, you need NerdStorageVault. Step 3 of 3 Implement a method, called storeToken(), which mutates NerdStorageVault data, and bind that method to the AbTestNerdletNerdlet instance: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy When you call storeToken() with a new token value, your Nerdlet uses NerdGraph APIs to mutate NerdStorageVault data for the api_token key. If the request to NerdGraph is successful, storeToken() updates state.token so that the new token is locally accessible. Unlike NerdStorage, which has query and mutation components for your convenience, NerdStorageVault has no components in the SDK. Instead, you have to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to interact with it Important It's important to remember that NerdStorageVault is limited to the user scope. Any other users of your New Relic One application will have their own NerdStorageVault data. This means that even other users on your account will need to enter their token separately. Query your API token Step 1 of 2 First, create methods and state to show and hide your API token prompt: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy state.hideTokenPrompt determines whether or not the prompt is visible. Now, you need a mechanism for revealing the prompt, which is hidden by default. Step 2 of 2 Query NerdStorageVault for your api_token: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, in componentDidMount(), you've queried NerdGraph for your api_token data. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that's called when your component is mounted in the component tree. This means that early in it's setup process, your application will request your api_token. If the NerdGraph query responds successfully with your token from NerdStorageVault, it sets the token in state. Otherwise, it shows the prompt so that you can enter a token. This is great for storing an initial token, but what if you enter the wrong token or the API changes? You need a way reveal the prompt on-demand. Next, you'll create the actual token prompt and a button to manually invoke the prompt. Create your token prompt Step 1 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named token-prompt.js: bash Copy $ touch token-prompt.js Step 2 of 9 In this new file, create a button that allows you to enter a new token on demand: import React from 'react'; import { Button } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenButton receives showPrompt() in its props and calls that method when its Button is clicked. Step 3 of 9 Create a token prompt using a Modal with a TextField: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenPrompt renders a Modal with a TextField, a Button, and an explanatory prompt. You use the Modal to enter your API token. It also provides basic error handling if you try to submit the form with no token value. It's important to distinguish the token in AbTestNerdletNerdlet.state and the token in ApiTokenPrompt.state. The token in your Nerdlet's state is the current token that your Nerdlet knows about. It's this token that matches what's in NerdStorageVault. The token in ApiTokenPrompt.state is a fluid value that changes as you update the text in the TextField. When you press Submit in the modal, ApiTokenPrompt submits its token to your Nerdlet's storeToken() method. Then, storeToken() mutates NerdStorageVault with the new token. You also implemented a few methods to improve the user experience: keyPress() submits the token when the RETURN key is pressed showTokenError() and hideTokenError() remind the user that they must enter a token before submitting the form Step 4 of 9 Export your components, so you can use them in your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } export { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import ApiTokenButton and ApiTokenPrompt and add them to render(): import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; import { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } from './token-prompt'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you visit your application for the first time, the prompt is automatically revealed. Enter \"ABC123\" in the TextField, as that's the token that the third-party service expects. Once you submit your token and your Nerdlet hides the prompt, click Update API token at the bottom of your New Relic One application to reveal it again: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Pass your API token to TotalCancellations Step 1 of 3 In index.js, pass the API token to TotalCancellations so you're prepared to make a request to the third-party service: import React from 'react';

} } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <TotalCancellations token={this.state.token} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 2 of 3 In total-cancellations.js, log the token to your browser console: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { lastToken: null } } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) this.setState({lastToken: this.props.token}) } } render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy Here, you've implemented another React lifecycle method, called componentDidUpdate(). Now, every time your Nerdlet's state.token changes, TotalCancellations gets a new token prop, which triggers componentDidUpdate(). In componentDidUpdate(), you check that the incoming token is not the same as the last token it knew about, which is stored in local state. If the incoming token is different, you log a message with the new token and update state.lastToken. This logic prepares your code for a future change to use your API token in a request to a third-party service. Step 3 of 3 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see the log from TotalCancellations in your browser's console: If you change your token, you'll see another log from TotalCancellations with your updated token. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now you know how to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to manage data in NerdStorageVault! Remember, use NerdStorage for your New Relic One application's non-sensitive data and NerdStorageVault for the sensitive stuff like tokens, passwords, and other secrets. As a bonus, you created a way to manage your token in NerdStorageVault from the user interface. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component for later use. Whether it's been with NrqlQuery, AccountStorageQuery, AccountStorageMutation, NerdGraphQuery, or NerdGraphMutation, you've learned several ways to interact with New Relic data in your New Relic One application. But New Relic One applications aren't just another way to show New Relic data. The purpose of New Relic One applications is to show you how your software is helping you meet your business objectives. Sometimes, New Relic data is all you need to make that happen, but other times you need to look beyond New Relic for data to fill in the gaps.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add user interface components to your application, before starting this one. In previous hands-on lessons, you created all the charts from your design guide. Unfortunately, they aren’t laid out like they are in the design. The New Relic One SDK provides multiple solutions for organizing your components. The one you’ll learn about in this lesson is the Grid component. To arrange your charts, place them in a Grid. A Grid is a container you use to organize your content into 12-column rows. A GridItem is the building block for a Grid. You specify the columnSpan of a GridItem between 1 and 12 to determine how much of the row that the GridItem should cover. So, if you want a chart to stretch across the width of the view, you would place the chart in a GridItem with a columnSpan of 12. If you want twelve charts to fit in a single row, use a columnSpan of 1. Using the design guide as a base, you can plan how to organize your Grid: Once you’ve planned out how you’re going to arrange your columns, you can write some code to realize your plans. Step 1 of 6 Change to the add-a-grid/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import Grid and GridItem. Then, update your Nerdlet's render() method by placing each chart in a GrildItem. Finally, place all your items in a Grid: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy The columnSpan for each chart matches the layout plan. Every chart that takes up half the 12-column row has a columnSpan of 6, and every chart that takes up the whole row has a columnSpan of 12. Notice that each of the charts in the ChartGroup, but not the ChartGroup itself, is in a GridItem. A ChartGroup connects charts' behaviors, not their locations. Each chart fills its columnSpan because they use the fullWidth prop. fullWidth makes the chart fill its available horizontal space and GridItem.columnSpan restricts that space to some fraction of the row. Remove a fullWidth prop, and see how the chart reacts. Technical detail Notice the wrapper class applied to the Grid. We quietly provided some CSS styles to help make this app look great! This isn't a CSS course, so we won't cover everything we added, we'll just include the styles we intend for you to use in the code snippets. Just know that every UI component in the New Relic One SDK provides a className prop where you can provide a CSS class name. You can view the styles in nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add chart headings, before starting this one. With your charts organized and descriptive headings above each one, your New Relic One application is becoming more usable. In this lesson, you'll continue that trend by creating descriptions for each design version in your A/B test. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-version-descriptions/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-version-descriptions/ab-test Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named description.js: bash Copy $ touch description.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a new React component, called VersionDescription, which uses a HeadingText and a BlockText to render a version description that you pass, using the description prop: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, HeadingText } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionDescription extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return ( <div> <HeadingText className=\"versionHeader\"> Version {this.props.version} </HeadingText> <BlockText className=\"versionText\"> {this.props.description} </BlockText> </div> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/description.js Copy You'll use this one class to create a version description for each design version in your A/B test. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import VersionDescription, create descriptions for each design version, and create a new GridItem component for each design version: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you've created two VersionDescription components. You passed the description and version props, which correspond to a design version. You also added a horizontal rule to visually separate the descriptions from the charts in your app. For this, you added a GridItem with a columnSpan of 12, to stretch the rule the full width of the grid. Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-version-descriptions/ab-test. Step 6 of 8 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier.

      "body": "Taking some time to consider your headings and document titles will be time well spent. Titles and headings are not only important for search results, but they can make your docs easier to skim. For all headings and document titles, use sentence case. Use parallel construction Use parallel construction when naming headers. For example, use all nouns (\"Organization,\" \"Tone\"), all verbs (\"Create,\" \"Delete\"), etc. Keep it short, avoid -ing words For all headers, keep the title as short as possible. In particular, avoid headers that are more than a line long. As with all our writing, you should feel free to address the reader directly: Install the agent, for example, rather than Agent installation. You should also avoid -ing words, which add to character count without contributing clarity. Do not use h1 headings After you publish your doc, the docs site will automatically use what you added to the Title field as the doc's level one heading (h1). To ensure that your doc is properly indexed for search, do not manually create additional h1 headings. If your doc's title is long and you would like a shorter title to appear in the sidebar menu, create a GitHub issue and we'll help you with that change. Use level two headings to identify chunks of information Organize chunks of information into sections with level two headings (##). For example: ## Create a new user [#create-new-user] Copy Important If you don't specify an ID manually, the site will use your header text as that header's ID (also known as anchor link). Create a manual ID to preserve links to that header if you change the header text. If you have too many level sections, consider splitting the document into multiple pages. Avoid using level three headings Avoid using ### headings unless it makes sense for the content or if the content is lengthy. Collapsers, tables, and other structural elements are often a better choice. Be particularly careful about level three headings that make a level two section longer than a single screen height. Here are two examples of good scenarios for using level three headings: Example #1: Events-to-metrics API doc Example #2: Infrastructure integration doc",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add version descriptions, before starting this one. In this course, you’re building an A/B test application in New Relic. The application presents a lot of data, through its charts, about the effectiveness of each design version you’re testing on your demo website. Ultimately, you’ll be able to use that data to decide which design is most effective and show that design to every user who visits your site. In this lesson, you’ll build a form into your application that lets you choose which design you want to show to every user of your site. Before writing any code, look at your design guide to review the section you’re going to build: This new section has three main components: A heading with instructional copy: \"Pick a version to end the test\" A component that you use to crown the winning version of the A/B test A button to confirm the winner that you selected Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-end-test-section/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named end-test.js: bash Copy $ touch end-test.js Step 3 of 10 In this new file, create a VersionSelector component to encapsulate a Select and its SelectItem child components: import React from 'react'; import { Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy VersionSelector renders a Select component with two choices. In each SelectItem, you specify a value prop. In this case, you use 'A' to represent version A and 'B' to represent version B. Step 4 of 10 Create another component for a Button you'll use to make your test as ended: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy This looks trivial, but it will encapsulate button logic as you iterate on your app code. Step 5 of 10 Create a final component for the entire section you'll use to mark the end of your test: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you create a Grid with three items. First, you create a GridItem that contains a HeadingText and spans all 12 columns. In the next row, you have two items: The VersionSelector component you created in the previous step A Button which reads \"End test\" These items each span one column, but instead of using columnSpan, they use a combination of columnStart and columnEnd to specify which columns they cover. Step 6 of 10 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, add EndTestSection to your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. However, you need to make a few improvements to this code. When you select a version, the selected value in the component doesn't change.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Persist the selected version, before starting this one. In this tutorial, you're building an A/B test application. The application surfaces data about an ongoing A/B test on your website, which you then use to decide which page design version is most effective at engaging users. As part of that overarching goal, you're building a section which allows you to end the test by deciding a winner of the experiment: Unfortunately, there are a few issues with the code and design for this section. By the end of this course, pressing End test will tell your website's backend server that every customer should see the version selected here. This is destructive behavior because it makes an irreversible change to your website. To account for the desctructiveness of pressing End test, you need to modify some features of your application: Make the button look important to catch your eye Prompt yourself with a confirmation message before ending the test to ensure you don't end it prematurely Show and hide your confirmation modal Step 1 of 12 Change to the present-confirmation-modal/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test This directory contains the code your application should have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 12 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, update the Button to use the DESTRUCTIVE styling: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Tip Read more about Button and its props on the New Relic developer site. Step 3 of 12 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test. Step 4 of 12 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 12 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 12 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: Now you've styled your button to convey its destructive consequences, but that's not enough to prevent you from accidentally clicking it. Next, you create a shield for your website's backend. This extra layer of protection requires you to confirm that you intend to end the test before actually doing so. Step 7 of 12 Add a Modal to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Your new modal contains a heading, a confirmation message, the winning design version, and two buttons. You'll explore some of these components later in this course. With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your new Modal: Tip Remember, while your server is running, it will update automatically when you save your code. The modal looks great, but it has three issues: It was present before you clicked End test You can't dismiss it It always says you selected \"Version A\", even if you didn't In the following steps, you'll correct all three of these issues. Step 8 of 12 In EndTestButton, initialize state with a value for modalHidden: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy modalHidden determines whether or not to hide the modal. The default value of modalHidden is true because you only want to show the modal when you select End test. Step 9 of 12 Supply modalHidden to the Modal: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy First, you've created a constructor to accept component props. This provides your component access to the modalHidden prop that you passed in EndTestSection. Then you provide the value of modalHidden to the Modal component's hidden prop. Tip Read more about Modal and its props on the New Relic developer site. Step 10 of 12 Add and bind two new methods to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Use closeModal and showModal to close and show your modal, respectively, depending on how a user interacts with the modal. Step 11 of 12 Show the modal when you click End test: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you've supplied showModal() as the callback for the Button component's onClick event. Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. The modal is hidden by default. Click End test to see the modal. Step 12 of 12 Close the modal from the Modal component's onClose callback and from the Yes, end test and No, continue test buttons: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Click End test. The modal opens and displays your confirmation message. Close the modal by clicking X at the top right, either of its buttons, or even in the dark space to its left. Notice that the modal says you chose \"Version A\", even if you choose \"Version B\". This is because \"Version A\" is hardcoded in the Modal text. Next, you'll make that dynamic. Use the version you selected in your modal Step 1 of 2 In EndTestSection, pass selectedVersion to the EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Now, you can access the selected version from the EndTestButton component's props. Step 2 of 2 Use selectedVersion in your confirmation message: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Select \"Version B\" from the menu. Click End test to see \"Version B\" in the confirmation modal: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Congratulations! You've done a lot of work and it shows in the usefulness of your application. You've created charts that show mocked data. You've organized your charts into a readable structure. You've added an interface for your users to interact with the test. Now, you need some real data. In the next lesson, you'll replace the mocked data in your charts with real data from your backend service.

Auto-telemetry with Pixie therefore benefits from Pixie's approach to keeping data secure. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. Community Cloud for Pixie makes queries directly to your Kubernetes cluster to access the data. In order for the query results to be shown in the Community Cloud for Pixie UI, CLI, and API, the data is sent to the client from your cluster using a reverse proxy. Community Cloud for Pixie’s reverse proxy is designed to ensure: Data is ephemeral. It only passes through the Community Cloud for Pixie's cloud proxy in transit. This ensures data locality. Data is encrypted while in transit. Only you are able to read your data. New Relic One fetches and stores data that related to an application's performance. With Auto-telemetry with Pixie, a predefined subset of data persists outside of your cluster. This data is stored in our database, in your selected region. This data persists in order to give you long-term storage, alerting, correlation with additional data, and the ability to use advanced New Relic platform capabilities, such as anomaly detection. The persisted performance metrics include, but are not limited to: Golden metrics (throughput, latency, error rate) for HTTP-based services HTTP transaction data Database transaction data (for MySQL & PostgreSQL) Distributed tracing JVM metrics The data you view on the Live debugging tab comes through Community Cloud for Pixie, and is therefore potentially sensitive. It is not stored by New Relic and is ephemeral and queryable for less than 24 hours. Control who has access to Pixie data If you want to manage which members of your organization can view Pixie data in New Relic One, as well as install and delete Pixie links, you can create a custom role. Note that this option is available only to Enterprise and Pro level customers. For more information, see New Relic's user model. Manage auto-update and two-way communication Pixie maintains an active two-way communication channel from your host system to Community Cloud with Pixie at withpixie.ai. Pixie uses this communication channel to query data, push updates, and retrieve metadata and health checks about Pixie and your Kubernetes cluster. By default, Pixie queries withpixie.ai to check if new updates have been pushed and then automatically installs them if they’re present. To disable auto updates, you must set a flag prior to the install process using either Helm or in the newrelic-manifest.yaml file. To disable automatic updates, choose one: Helm option Add --set pixie-chart.disableAutoUpdate=true to your Helm command. newrelic-manifest.yaml option in your newrelic-manifest.yaml file under the pl-cluster-config section, add PL_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE: \"true\" to the data directive.

Auto-telemetry with Pixie therefore benefits from Pixie's approach to keeping data secure. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. Community Cloud for Pixie makes queries directly to your Kubernetes cluster to access the data. In order for the query results to be shown in the Community Cloud for Pixie UI, CLI, and API, the data is sent to the client from your cluster using a reverse proxy. Community Cloud for Pixie’s reverse proxy is designed to ensure: Data is ephemeral. It only passes through the Community Cloud for Pixie's cloud proxy in transit. This ensures data locality. Data is encrypted while in transit. Only you are able to read your data. New Relic One fetches and stores data that related to an application's performance. With Auto-telemetry with Pixie, a predefined subset of data persists outside of your cluster. This data is stored in Telemetry Data Platform, in the your selected region. This data persists in order to give you long-term storage, alerting, correlation with additional data, and the ability to use advanced New Relic platform capabilities, such as anomaly detection. The persisted performance metrics include, but are not limited to: Golden metrics (throughput, latency, error rate) for HTTP-based services HTTP transaction data Database transaction data (for MySQL & PostgreSQL) Distributed tracing JVM metrics The data you view on the Live debugging tab comes through Community Cloud for Pixie, and is therefore potentially sensitive. It is not stored by New Relic and is ephemeral and queryable for less than 24 hours. Control who has access to Pixie data If you want to manage which members of your organization can view Pixie data in New Relic One, as well as install and delete Pixie links, you can create a custom role. Note that this option is available only to Enterprise and Pro level customers. For more information, see New Relic's user model. Manage auto-update and two-way communication Pixie maintains an active two-way communication channel from your host system to Community Cloud with Pixie at withpixie.ai. Pixie uses this communication channel to query data, push updates, and retrieve metadata and health checks about Pixie and your Kubernetes cluster. By default, Pixie queries withpixie.ai to check if new updates have been pushed and then automatically installs them if they’re present. To disable auto updates, you must set a flag prior to the install process using either Helm or in the newrelic-manifest.yaml file. To disable automatic updates, choose one: Helm option Add --set pixie-chart.disableAutoUpdate=true to your Helm command. newrelic-manifest.yaml option in your newrelic-manifest.yaml file under the pl-cluster-config section, add PL_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE: \"true\" to the data directive.

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. Each anomaly can be clicked on to bring up an automatic analysis. You can have notifications for anomalies delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. By creating a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you’re interested in), you can then add this configuration as a source, and have anomalies automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the New Relic application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entityGuid. entityGuid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entity.guid. entity.name string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entityName. Example: Laura's coffee service. entityName string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entity.name. entity.type string The type of entity (currently only APPLICATION but will change with future functionality). evaluationType string This is always anomaly. event string Indicates whether it's the beginning (open) or end (close) of the anomalous data. openTime timestamp The time when the anomaly opened. Example: 1615303740000. signalType string The type of data that was analyzed. For example, error_rate or response_time.non_web. timestamp timestamp The time at which the event was written. title string Description of the anomaly. Example: Error rate was much higher than normal. Add anomalies as source in Incident Intelligence By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in Incident Intelligence, see Configure sources. You can also select Connect to Incident Intelligence from inside of a configuration. Webhook payload and examples Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema. Attribute Description category enum The category of data that was analyzed. Categories include web throughput, non-web throughput, web transactions, non-web transactions, and error class. data list The time series data leading up to the detection. data[].timestamp number The timestamp of the data point in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Example: 1584366819000 data[].unit string The unit describing the value of the data point. Data units include count, milliseconds, and error_rate. data[].value number The value of the data point. Example: 1.52 detectionType enum The type of data that was analyzed. Types include latency, throughput, and error_rate. entity object The entity that reported the unusual data. entity.accountId number The ID for the entity's account. entity.domain enum The domain for the entity. Example: APM. entity.domainId string The id used to uniquely identify the entity within the domain. entity.guid string The guid used to uniquely identify the entity across all products. entity.name string The name of the entity. Example: Laura’s coffee service entity.link string A link to view the entity. Example: https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/applications/987654321” Copy severity enum A description of how unusual of a change occurred, including NORMAL, WARNING, or CRITICAL. version string Version used to describe the data being provided. Example: v1 JSON schema example Applied Intelligence will send the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx).

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you learned of a third-party service that you can use to fetch mock cancellation data for the Total cancellations per version chart in your New Relic One application. Even though the data in this service is fake, the real value of this lesson is learning how you can use third party services to supply data to your New Relic One application. If you make a request to the mock service with cancellation data (https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations) you'll see a response rejecting your request with a message that reads \"Unauthorized\": bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations Unauthorized This is because the Nerdsletter API requires an Authorization header. More specifically, you must pass a bearer token of ABC123 to gain authorized access to its data. If you make a request to the service with the header Authorization: Bearer ABC123, you'll get a successful response with the mocked cancellation data: bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations -H 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' {\"a\": 15, \"b\": 78} In the last lesson, you used NerdGraph to store this API token in your New Relic One application's NerdStorageVault data store. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component and logged its use to your browser's console. In this lesson, you follow up that log statement with a real request to the Nerdsletter API using your authorization token. Then, you supply the data from that external resource to your Total cancellations per version chart. Step 1 of 6 Change to the third-party-services/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/third-party-services/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 6 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js, make a request to api.nerdsletter.net with your API token. Save the results to state, and use that state in render(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { cancellations: [], lastToken: null } } generateChartData(data) { const cancellationsA = data ? data.a : 0; const cancellationsB = data ? data.b : 0; return [ { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsA }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsB }, ], }, ] } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`Requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) fetch( \"https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations\", {headers: {\"Authorization\": `Bearer ${this.props.token}`}} ).then( (response) => { if (response.status == 200) { return response.json() } else if (response.status == 401) { console.error(\"Incorrect auth header\") } else { console.error(response.text()) } } ).then( (data) => { if (data) { this.setState({ cancellations: this.generateChartData(data), lastToken: this.props.token }) } } ) } } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={this.state.cancellations} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy In this code, you initialize TotalCancellations.state.cancellations with zero for the y-value in each series instead of the previously hardcoded values. This helps to more realistically represent what the chart should show if your New Relic One app hasn't successfully requested data from the Nerdsletter API. Next, you use Javascript's fetch() function to make an HTTP request to the Nerdsletter API. You then pass your token in the request's Authorization header. If the request is successful, you update the cancellation data in TotalCancellations.state so that that data is reflected in the component's render method. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/third-party-service/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. If your token in NerdStorageVault is not \"ABC123\", then your console will show an error that reads, \"Incorrect auth header\": If you set the token to \"ABC123\", then Total cancellations per version updates to show the values from the third-party service: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great job! You've come a long way from running nr1 nerdpack:create for the first time. Take a look back at your design guide to see that your application now has everything from an interface and data perspective that you planned from the beginning: You've created eight charts with varying styles and supplied them with dynamic data from multiple sources. You've learned about the New Relic One SDK and used many of its components. You've even gathered data from a third-party service and mixed it seemlessly with your New Relic data to provide a complete look at how the competing versions in your A/B test perform against each other. From here, there is only one more set of APIs in the New Relic One SDK that you've yet to get your hands on: Platform APIs. These will come in handy in improving the usability of your New Relic One application.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize NRQL data, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { this[index] = { endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, } }, data ) historicalData.data = data return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data, format it according to the TableChart specifications, and set it on historicalData.data. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "One way for users to access your Nerdlet is by creating a launcher. The launcher opens a Nerdlet from the Apps page in New Relic. You can also provide access to your Nerdlet from an entity in your account. In this guide, you'll learn how to attach your Nerdlet to your entities. Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install and configure the New Relic One CLI Create a Nerdpack Step 1 of 5 Update your CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 5 Create a Nerdpack with the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name entity-nerdlet This results in a Nerdpack, called entity-nerdlet, which consists of a launcher, called entity-nerdlet-launcher, and a Nerdlet, called entity-nerdlet-nerdlet. Step 3 of 5 Serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ cd entity-nerdlet $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 4 of 5 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and navigate to Apps: ?nerdpacks=local is required to enable your locally served Nerdpacks to load in New Relic. Step 5 of 5 Under Your apps, click your launcher to view your New Relic One application: Attach your Nerdlet to entities You've seen how you can access your Nerdlet from a launcher. Now, access your Nerdlet from your entities. Step 1 of 6 From inside your Nerdpack's root directory, open nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json. This is your Nerdlet's metadata file. You'll use this file to attach your Nerdlet to entities. Step 2 of 6 Add a context object with an entities array: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [] 8 } 9 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy This tells New Relic that you want to surface your Nerdlet in an array of entity contexts. Step 3 of 6 Add an entity context: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [ 8 { 9 \"domain\": \"APM\", 10 \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" 11 } 12 ] 13 } 14 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Here, you've attached your Nerdlet to all application entities in the APM domain. Step 4 of 6 Go to APM: Because you're serving your Nerdpack locally, remember that you must still specify the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 5 of 6 Choose any of your applications: Step 6 of 6 Scroll down to see your Nerdlet attached to the application: Click this menu option and see your Nerdlet the same way you did with the launcher. Configure your entities context The context.entities key in your Nerdlet's nr1.json file specifies which entities your Nerdlet should be attached to. Specify an entity domain Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity domain by specifying the domain as one of the following values: APM: Application Performance Monitoring BROWSER: Browser INFRA: Infrastructure monitoring MOBILE: Mobile monitoring SYNTH: Synthetic monitoring For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities in the APM domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those in a domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"!APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities in multiple domains: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" }] } } Copy Specify an entity type Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity type by specifying the type as one of the following values: APPLICATION HOST MONITOR For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities of the APPLICATION type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those of a specified type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"!APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity whose type matches one of an array of types: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }, { \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }] } } Copy Specify entity tags Attach your Nerdlet to entities that have a given tag. For example, attach your Nerdlet to the entity which has a particular GUID: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"guid\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ENTITY GUID>\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity which has particular accountId and uses the Python programming language: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"accountId\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ACCOUNT ID>\"] }, { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Combine filters When you filter the entities to which your Nerdlet will be added, you can combine domain, type, and tags: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"domain\": \"APM\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\", \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] }, { \"domain\": \"SYNTH\", \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" } ] } } Copy In this example, you've attached your Nerdlet to: All APM applications whose metadata tags specify the python language AND all Synthetic monitors AND all Browser entities",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add a grid, before starting this one. Organizing charts is one way to clarify the information you're trying to convey to your users. Headings are another. Since you have several charts on the same page, use headings to describe the information they show. To remember what data each chart presents, consult your design guide: The design guide details what data each chart shows. Use those details to craft useful headings for your charts. Step 1 of 6 Change to the add-chart-headings/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-chart-headings/ab-test Step 2 of 6 In newsletter-signups.js, page-views.js, past-tests.js, total-cancellations.js, total-subscriptions.js, and totals.js, import HeadingText and add a descriptive heading above the chart in each of your custom components: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } const versionBSignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-b-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 20 }, { x: 10, y: 5 }, { x: 20, y: 25 }, { x: 30, y: 45 }, { x: 40, y: 50 }, { x: 50, y: 35 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionASignups, versionBSignups]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [ { \"endDate\": \"12-15-2020\", \"versionADescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was green.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was blue.\", \"winner\": \"A\" }, { \"endDate\": \"09-06-2019\", \"versionADescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a carousel.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a grid.\", \"winner\": \"B\" } ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { const versionATotals = { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[versionATotals]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Notice the new <div> tag in each render(), which allows you to return multiple elements at once. Also, remember that we provided you a CSS stylesheet that styles the chartHeader class. You can look at nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss to see more. You don't need to modify your Nerdlet's render() method in index.js because your components encapsulate the new code. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see that your charts have descriptive headings. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Well done! You've created all the charts that are laid out in your design guide. You’ve also organized them into a neat grid and added headings so that the charts are intelligible. While chart headings helps you understand what each chart shows, it'd be nice to add descriptions to help you remember what each version in your A/B test represents. In the next lesson, you'll add a description for each design version. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add version descriptions, before starting this one. In this course, you’re building an A/B test application in New Relic. The application presents a lot of data, through its charts, about the effectiveness of each design version you’re testing on your demo website. Ultimately, you’ll be able to use that data to decide which design is most effective and show that design to every user who visits your site. In this lesson, you’ll build a form into your application that lets you choose which design you want to show to every user of your site. Before writing any code, look at your design guide to review the section you’re going to build: This new section has three main components: A heading with instructional copy: \"Pick a version to end the test\" A component that you use to crown the winning version of the A/B test A button to confirm the winner that you selected Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-end-test-section/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named end-test.js: bash Copy $ touch end-test.js Step 3 of 10 In this new file, create a VersionSelector component to encapsulate a Select and its SelectItem child components: import React from 'react'; import { Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy VersionSelector renders a Select component with two choices. In each SelectItem, you specify a value prop. In this case, you use 'A' to represent version A and 'B' to represent version B. Step 4 of 10 Create another component for a Button you'll use to make your test as ended: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy This looks trivial, but it will encapsulate button logic as you iterate on your app code. Step 5 of 10 Create a final component for the entire section you'll use to mark the end of your test: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you create a Grid with three items. First, you create a GridItem that contains a HeadingText and spans all 12 columns. In the next row, you have two items: The VersionSelector component you created in the previous step A Button which reads \"End test\" These items each span one column, but instead of using columnSpan, they use a combination of columnStart and columnEnd to specify which columns they cover. Step 6 of 10 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, add EndTestSection to your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. However, you need to make a few improvements to this code. When you select a version, the selected value in the component doesn't change. You must control the value that Select displays using its value prop and onChange event handler. In the next lesson, you’ll update your code to persist your version choice in the Select component. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Persist the selected version.",

The page that opens is index.js, the file that manages the parts of the home page, but not the content. It's rare that you'll need to make changes to this file. Most home page changes will be to add a new tile or section to the page, or update links. These types of changes are handled in two files: src/data/homepage.yml - contains home page section titles, section descriptions, and the URLs for tiles. src/i18n/translations/en/translation.json - contains tile info, including the title and short description of tiles.

      "body": "We use the data dictionary to provide information about data types (for example, Transaction, Metric, Log) and attached attributes. This is exposed in the New Relic query experience, on hovering over the data types and attributes. And we also expose the dictionary to the public. This doc contains info on how to add data to the dictionary. Note that currently we don't have infrastructure integration data in the dictionary. We also have very few attributes for the Metric data type, just a few basic default ones, despite there being many potential attributes attached to that data type depending on what the data source is. Data dictionary structure The data in the data dictionary is structured like this: Data types: sometimes called \"events\" for historical reasons, these are the NRDB data objects, like Transaction, Metric, Log, Span, etc. Attributes: these are key:value pairs attached to data types. One attribute can have multiple data types listed for it. For example, appName is on multiple data types. Data source: The New Relic product from which the data originates. With the current implementation, a data type must have a single data source assigned. This isn't ideal, as theoretically a data type can come from multiple sources. Add a new data type To add a new data type: Make a new folder in this directory, alongside the other directories: src/data-dictionary/events Copy Duplicate a data type file (for example, this Metric data type), place it in the new folder, and fill it out with the new info. For how to add attributes on a new data type, keep reading. Add attributes To add attributes: Check if there's an existing attribute that has the same name and same general definition as the one you're trying to add. If it exists, edit that file to include the new data type (under events:). If an existing attribute is fairly close in definition but not exact, try to edit the definition so it works for all associated data types. If there is no existing attribute, create a new one. The easiest way is to copy an existing attribute file, edit all relevant fields to be accurate, and place it in the folder of the data type it's attached to (for example, Transaction). When writing an attribute, try to keep it as concise as possible, and avoid using links. For more on that, see Style. If the attribute has one of the units of measurement we use (like units: percentage (%)), add that to the front matter. For info on units, see Units. Attribute style guidelines When adding or editing attributes, some things to keep in mind: Aim for concise descriptions. Notes on this: Feel free to use sentence fragments. Feel free to edit definitions submitted from internal teams as sometimes their definitions will be overly long or have unneeded links. Some attributes are only present in some situations (for example, when a specific APM agent is used, or when a specific config option is true). We should avoid documenting most of these, with the idea that most customers will only care about the data because it's being reported for them, and won't care about the things that factor into the reasons why it wouldn't be reported. If it's thought that the addition would help customers who already have the data reporting understand the data better, you can include it. Write so it reads well as plain text. Details on this: Note that the docs site data dictionary has our usual docs styles available, but the query UI definitions have no styling available. This means that you should write definitions so that they are understandable without any styling, as plain text. You can often avoid any need for styling (for example, data types like Transaction are easy to understand as plain text, as are most phrasings that use attribute names or values. When plain text makes something too ambiguous and you need some styling, use back ticks to indicate attributes or values (for example, a definition like: Reported when ` category ` is ` http ` ). Using this also sets us up for success if we implement styling in the UI definitions in the future. We should avoid links because those aren't visible in the query UI; the query UI only displays plain text. However, every attribute entry in the query UI does display a 'See attribute in docs' link that links to the complete and normally formatted docs site entry. This means that we can use links provided that they will display in an easy to understand way in the query UI. For example, here's an example of an attribute that would read clearly in plain text despite not having a link. We should avoid using a link format like \"For more information, see Create an alert condition\", because it wouldn't read well in plain text, and would choose something like \"For more information, see our alert condition docs.\" Using units of measurement Attribute entries have an optional unit of measurement field in the front matter. For example, here the front matter for an attribute with a percent unit of measurement: --- name: cpuPercent type: attribute units: percentage (%) events: - ProcessSample --- Copy What unit of measurement to select for an attribute is sometimes obvious, like if the attribute value is measured in milliseconds (units: milliseconds (ms)) or seconds (units: seconds (s)) or a percentage (units: percentage (%)). We also have several units of measurement that are not obvious, like count, enum, rate, and ID. (Technically, these aren't actually \"units of measurement\" and are more just conceptual data types but we're doing it this way as a workaround so you can ignore the fact that units of measurement isn't actually accurate.) The main reason we want to specify this information is that this will control what kinds of queries or charts can be created or auto-suggested by New Relic. For example, the New Relic UI wouldn't want to auto-suggest a chart graphing the average of ID values because that wouldn't make any sense. So attributes with accurate units, such as data types, will help product provide more practical help/suggestions to customers in future. Here are some tips for the non-obvious unit types: count: This is a count of something, though not a count of time-based units. For a number to be a count, it must (a) only be capable of increasing during a given time/sampling period, and (b) have a theoretically uncapped range. This wouldn't be used for a count of time units; if it was a count of seconds, for example, you would just use 'seconds' as the unit of measurement. A couple of examples of a count: databaseCallCount threadConcurrency enum: enum is short for enumerated list. In other words, it is a specific range of numbers that represent other non-numeric elements. For example, an attribute that had HTTP error codes (404, 505, etc.) as possible values would be an enum. A range of numbers that represent color codes would be another example of an enum. (Theoretically, an enum can represent lists without numeric values but we have no need to categorize strings so we only care about numeric-value lists.) Example: httpResponsecode. rate: Use this for any rate (for example, count per second). These are typically for averaged rates over small units of time, like second or millisecond. We previously have used the unit of time for these attributes (for example, using seconds as the unit of measurement for a count per second rate), but now we want to use rate for these. This is necessary because the types of displays used for rates would be different than the types of displays used for a simpler duration/count measurement. Example: MySQL integration attribute db.innodb.dataReadBytesPerSecond, which has the definition \"Rate at which data is read from InnoDB tables in bytes per second.\" id: Use ID for any identification number attribute. Example: appId.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you learned of a third-party service that you can use to fetch mock cancellation data for the Total cancellations per version chart in your New Relic One application. Even though the data in this service is fake, the real value of this lesson is learning how you can use third party services to supply data to your New Relic One application. If you make a request to the mock service with cancellation data (https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations) you'll see a response rejecting your request with a message that reads \"Unauthorized\": bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations Unauthorized This is because the Nerdsletter API requires an Authorization header. More specifically, you must pass a bearer token of ABC123 to gain authorized access to its data. If you make a request to the service with the header Authorization: Bearer ABC123, you'll get a successful response with the mocked cancellation data: bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations -H 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' {\"a\": 15, \"b\": 78} In the last lesson, you used NerdGraph to store this API token in your New Relic One application's NerdStorageVault data store. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component and logged its use to your browser's console. In this lesson, you follow up that log statement with a real request to the Nerdsletter API using your authorization token. Then, you supply the data from that external resource to your Total cancellations per version chart. Step 1 of 6 Change to the third-party-services/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/third-party-services/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 6 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js, make a request to api.nerdsletter.net with your API token. Save the results to state, and use that state in render(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { cancellations: [], lastToken: null } } generateChartData(data) { const cancellationsA = data ? data.a : 0; const cancellationsB = data ? data.b : 0; return [ { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsA }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsB }, ], }, ] } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`Requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) fetch( \"https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations\", {headers: {\"Authorization\": `Bearer ${this.props.token}`}} ).then( (response) => { if (response.status == 200) { return response.json() } else if (response.status == 401) { console.error(\"Incorrect auth header\") } else { console.error(response.text()) } } ).then( (data) => { if (data) { this.setState({ cancellations: this.generateChartData(data), lastToken: this.props.token }) } } ) } } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={this.state.cancellations} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy In this code, you initialize TotalCancellations.state.cancellations with zero for the y-value in each series instead of the previously hardcoded values. This helps to more realistically represent what the chart should show if your New Relic One app hasn't successfully requested data from the Nerdsletter API. Next, you use Javascript's fetch() function to make an HTTP request to the Nerdsletter API. You then pass your token in the request's Authorization header. If the request is successful, you update the cancellation data in TotalCancellations.state so that that data is reflected in the component's render method. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/third-party-service/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. If your token in NerdStorageVault is not \"ABC123\", then your console will show an error that reads, \"Incorrect auth header\": If you set the token to \"ABC123\", then Total cancellations per version updates to show the values from the third-party service: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great job! You've come a long way from running nr1 nerdpack:create for the first time. Take a look back at your design guide to see that your application now has everything from an interface and data perspective that you planned from the beginning: You've created eight charts with varying styles and supplied them with dynamic data from multiple sources. You've learned about the New Relic One SDK and used many of its components. You've even gathered data from a third-party service and mixed it seemlessly with your New Relic data to provide a complete look at how the competing versions in your A/B test perform against each other. From here, there is only one more set of APIs in the New Relic One SDK that you've yet to get your hands on: Platform APIs. These will come in handy in improving the usability of your New Relic One application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add NrqlQuery components to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In this series, you're creating a New Relic One application, or NR1 app for short, that shows A/B test data in a variety of charts. Most of the charts need to show data that comes from a demo service you spun up at the beginning of this series. To refresh your memory on what you're building, review your design guide: In the last lesson, you supplied real data, which comes from New Relic's database, to the following charts: Newsletter subscriptions per version Version A - Page views Version B - Page views Total subscriptions per version Because you have experience querying subscription and page view data, you may feel ready to supply data to even more charts: Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions However, these charts are different than the charts you've supplied data to because they compare data from two different sources: subscription events and pageView events. In this lesson, you learn how to format data from multiple sources to exist in the same chart. Experiment with data in the Data explorer Step 1 of 6 From your New Relic homepage's top navigation menu, go to to the Data explorer: Here, you can experiment with subscription event and pageView event queries to make sure you fetch the right data in your app. Step 2 of 6 Select subscription from the Custom events menu: This queries NRDB for subscription event totals per minute over the last 30 minutes and shows that data in a chart: Step 3 of 6 Click Dimensions to see a list of the attributes associated with these subscription events: You can filter and group subscription events using these dimensions. For Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, you want to filter your subscription totals by page_version. Step 4 of 6 Click the NRQL query to navigate to the Query builder: Here, you can view and manually edit the query to fetch the data you need. Step 5 of 6 Add a WHERE clause to filter subscription totals by page_version: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Remove the TIMESERIES clause to fetch a count: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO Copy Modify the SINCE clause to see totals over the past week: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO Copy Click Run and see the data visualized in a billboard chart instead of a line chart: Step 6 of 6 Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions need a combined total of four data values: All-time subscription totals for version A All-time page view totals for version A All-time subscription totals for version B All-time page view totals for version B Experiment with the Query builder to discover the four queries which pull the right data. In the end, you'll come up with the following four queries: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'b' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = 'b' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO Copy technical detail Unlike other structured query languages, NRQL doesn't provide a mechanism for joining data across sources. This is why you have to perform two queries to get subscription event totals and pageView event totals. Until now, you've provided every chart with a single query. Here, you have to provide two queries per chart. In the remaining steps, you'll learn how to customize NrqlQuery results to merge data from multiple sources. Merge NRQL from multiple sources Step 1 of 9 Change to the customize-nrql-data/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/customize-nrql-data/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course.

Step 2 of 9 In your Nerdlet's totals.js file, implement constructor() and the React lifecycle method componentDidMount() in VersionTotals: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { tableData: { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } } } componentDidMount() { NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[0].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[1].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[this.state.tableData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Here, you initialize your state in the component's constructor. The state has a single value, tableData, which holds series data and metadata for the TableChart. In componentDidMount(), you query the data that populates the data in this state. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that is called when a component is mounted in the component tree. You use this method, instead of the constructor, to query data because your logic, which requests data from New Relic, introduces side effects and sets state values, neither of which you should do in the constructor. In componentDidMount(), you use NrqlQuery in a new way. First, you specified the formatType to NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW because you're going to modify the data instead of supplying it directly to a chart Before, you used its JSX form in the render() method of a chart. Second, you called its query() method and handled the results in a then() callback, which logs them to the console. Step 3 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, create a constant called ACCOUNT_ID and pass it to VersionTotals: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/ Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 4 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/customize-nrql-data/ab-test. Step 5 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 6 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Navigate to your app in New Relic. Step 7 of 9 To view your logs, which are useful for uncovering errors in your application, turn on developer tools in your favorite browser and navigate to the Console: FireFox instructions Safari instructions Chrome instructions With your app on-screen, notice the NRQL data in the console: This console log tells you that you can find the data you're looking for, namely the subscription or pageView count, at data.raw.results[0].count. The next step is to store that count in state.tableData. Tip If something doesn't work, use these debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 8 of 9 In totals.js, store the query data in state: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { tableData: { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } } } componentDidMount() { NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[0].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[1].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[this.state.tableData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Pay close attention to the data you're accessing. The array indices are particularly important to get right. The subscription data should go to state.tableData.data[0].count because in tableData, it is the first element in the data array: data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], Copy By similar logic, page view data should go to state.tableData.data[1].count. Step 9 of 9 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID In this lesson, you learned how to use NrqlQuery.query() to fetch data from multiple sources and stitch them together into data your chart can use. Notice that there are still two charts in your NR1 application that use mock data: Total unsubscriptions per version Past tests Unfortunately, your demo application doesn't create custom New Relic events when a user unsubscribes from your newsletter or you end an A/B test. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to populate Past tests.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorage from your nerdlet, before starting this one. Throughout this course, you're building a New Relic One application that gathers telemetry data from a demo web service that's running an A/B test on a newsletter signup form. The purpose of your New Relic One application is to help you understand how design changes impact the number of high quality newsletter subscriptions your service gets. The business objective, to increase your service's high quality newsletter subscriptions, relies primarily on three key pieces of information: Number of page views per version Number of subscriptions per version Number of cancellations Cancellations are important because if one design version of your newsletter signup form results in a high number of subscriptions but also a high number of cancellations, then those subscriptions are not as valuable. In previous lessons, you gathered data for page views and subscriptions from New Relic's database (NRDB), but you still need cancellation data. Your demo application does not report cancellation data to New Relic, so you need to fetch that data from an external source. We've provided a service at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations to return fake cancellation data for the purposes of this course. If you visit this URL in your browser, you'll see a brief message: \"Unauthorized\". This is because we created this service with a requirement that whoever requests its data must pass an Authorization header with the bearer token ABC123. So before you can request cancellation data from api.nerdsletter.net, you need to implement a few new behaviors in your application: Provide a mechanism for inputting an authorization token Persist the authorization token in a secure data store To input your authorization token, you'll use a Modal with a TextField. The secure data store you'll use is called NerdStorageVault. It's different from NerdStorage, which you used in the last lesson, because it only supports user storage and encrypts its data. Store your API token Step 1 of 3 Change to the add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 3 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, initialize state in AbTestNerdletNerdlet with a null token default: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Your Nerdlet uses this token state to manage the authorization token you'll later pass to the third-party service. However, a component's state is not a long-term solution for data management. For that, you need NerdStorageVault. Step 3 of 3 Implement a method, called storeToken(), which mutates NerdStorageVault data, and bind that method to the AbTestNerdletNerdlet instance: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy When you call storeToken() with a new token value, your Nerdlet uses NerdGraph APIs to mutate NerdStorageVault data for the api_token key. If the request to NerdGraph is successful, storeToken() updates state.token so that the new token is locally accessible. Unlike NerdStorage, which has query and mutation components for your convenience, NerdStorageVault has no components in the SDK. Instead, you have to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to interact with it Important It's important to remember that NerdStorageVault is limited to the user scope. Any other users of your New Relic One application will have their own NerdStorageVault data. This means that even other users on your account will need to enter their token separately. Query your API token Step 1 of 2 First, create methods and state to show and hide your API token prompt: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy state.hideTokenPrompt determines whether or not the prompt is visible. Now, you need a mechanism for revealing the prompt, which is hidden by default. Step 2 of 2 Query NerdStorageVault for your api_token: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, in componentDidMount(), you've queried NerdGraph for your api_token data. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that's called when your component is mounted in the component tree. This means that early in it's setup process, your application will request your api_token. If the NerdGraph query responds successfully with your token from NerdStorageVault, it sets the token in state. Otherwise, it shows the prompt so that you can enter a token. This is great for storing an initial token, but what if you enter the wrong token or the API changes? You need a way reveal the prompt on-demand. Next, you'll create the actual token prompt and a button to manually invoke the prompt. Create your token prompt Step 1 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named token-prompt.js: bash Copy $ touch token-prompt.js Step 2 of 9 In this new file, create a button that allows you to enter a new token on demand: import React from 'react'; import { Button } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenButton receives showPrompt() in its props and calls that method when its Button is clicked. Step 3 of 9 Create a token prompt using a Modal with a TextField: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenPrompt renders a Modal with a TextField, a Button, and an explanatory prompt. You use the Modal to enter your API token. It also provides basic error handling if you try to submit the form with no token value. It's important to distinguish the token in AbTestNerdletNerdlet.state and the token in ApiTokenPrompt.state. The token in your Nerdlet's state is the current token that your Nerdlet knows about. It's this token that matches what's in NerdStorageVault. The token in ApiTokenPrompt.state is a fluid value that changes as you update the text in the TextField. When you press Submit in the modal, ApiTokenPrompt submits its token to your Nerdlet's storeToken() method. Then, storeToken() mutates NerdStorageVault with the new token. You also implemented a few methods to improve the user experience: keyPress() submits the token when the RETURN key is pressed showTokenError() and hideTokenError() remind the user that they must enter a token before submitting the form Step 4 of 9 Export your components, so you can use them in your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } export { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import ApiTokenButton and ApiTokenPrompt and add them to render(): import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; import { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } from './token-prompt'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you visit your application for the first time, the prompt is automatically revealed. Enter \"ABC123\" in the TextField, as that's the token that the third-party service expects. Once you submit your token and your Nerdlet hides the prompt, click Update API token at the bottom of your New Relic One application to reveal it again: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Pass your API token to TotalCancellations Step 1 of 3 In index.js, pass the API token to TotalCancellations so you're prepared to make a request to the third-party service: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests';

this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <TotalCancellations token={this.state.token} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 2 of 3 In total-cancellations.js, log the token to your browser console: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { lastToken: null } } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) this.setState({lastToken: this.props.token}) } } render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy Here, you've implemented another React lifecycle method, called componentDidUpdate(). Now, every time your Nerdlet's state.token changes, TotalCancellations gets a new token prop, which triggers componentDidUpdate(). In componentDidUpdate(), you check that the incoming token is not the same as the last token it knew about, which is stored in local state. If the incoming token is different, you log a message with the new token and update state.lastToken. This logic prepares your code for a future change to use your API token in a request to a third-party service. Step 3 of 3 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see the log from TotalCancellations in your browser's console: If you change your token, you'll see another log from TotalCancellations with your updated token. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now you know how to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to manage data in NerdStorageVault! Remember, use NerdStorage for your New Relic One application's non-sensitive data and NerdStorageVault for the sensitive stuff like tokens, passwords, and other secrets. As a bonus, you created a way to manage your token in NerdStorageVault from the user interface. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component for later use. Whether it's been with NrqlQuery, AccountStorageQuery, AccountStorageMutation, NerdGraphQuery, or NerdGraphMutation, you've learned several ways to interact with New Relic data in your New Relic One application. But New Relic One applications aren't just another way to show New Relic data. The purpose of New Relic One applications is to show you how your software is helping you meet your business objectives. Sometimes, New Relic data is all you need to make that happen, but other times you need to look beyond New Relic for data to fill in the gaps.

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the Instant Observability catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info AbTest (Nerdpack): description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

AbTestNerdlet (Nerdlet): displayName: AbTestNerdlet supportedEntityTypes.mode: NONE All the information from catalog shows here. Step 3 of 3 View your app in Instant Observability: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Subscribe to your New Relic One application.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you used PlatformStateContext from the New Relic One SDK to look up the time range that the user selected from the app's time picker. Now, you'll learn about another component that interacts with the New Relic platform: navigation. The navigation component lets you open entities, navigate to entities, and build Location objects for entities from your Nerdlet. You can also use navigation for other Nerdlets and launchers. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-navigation/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In newsletter-signups.js, create a new method, called NewsletterSignups.openApmEntity(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. This method uses navigation.openStackedEntity() to display your demo application's APM entity in a stacked view. Notice openApmEntity() requires your ENTITY_GUID. You need to locate that ID and store it in a constant. Step 3 of 10 Navigate to APM: See metadata for your Newsletter service: Copy the entity's GUID: Create an ENTITY_GUID constant: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and the entity GUID you just copied, respectively. Now, openApmEntity() knows what entity to show. Next, you need to create a button to invoke this method. Step 4 of 10 Create a button to show your APM entity: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you've created a button and configured it to call openApmEntity() when it's clicked. Step 5 of 10 Import Stack and StackItem: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. You'll use Stack and StackItem to lay out the button on the far right side of the same row that the HeadingText is on. Step 6 of 10 Lay out the Stack: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <Stack fullWidth> <StackItem grow={true}> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> </StackItem> <StackItem> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> </StackItem> </Stack> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you used a full-width Stack to set up the layout for the row. To make the HeadingText fill the entire row except the width of the button, you used the StackItem.grow prop. Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. Click App performance: Now you see the stacked entity: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively Congratulations! You're finished writing all the code you'll write for your New Relic One A/B test application. Now, you have an application reporting New Relic data from your demo service that is running an A/B test. You've created several charts, buttons, and other UI elements. And you've organized your components into a readable and usable view. On top of the visuals, you've supplied data to your charts from multiple data sources in and outside of New Relic. You've created some backend functionality which utilizes your New Relic One application's own data store. You've also utilized the platform APIs for interacting with platform UI and showing a stacked entity view. You've really accomplished a lot throughout this course, so far. There are only a few things left to do! First, is to learn how to publish and subscribe to your New Relic One application so that it can run on our platform instead of your own local server. Second, is to learn how to deal with some common issues you might see in New Relic One application development.

If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add pie charts, before starting this one. In each hands-on lesson in this course, you have been adding something new to your A/B test application. You’ve spun up a new launcher and added multiple chart components to your Nerdlet. In this lesson, you’ll create two new TableChart components that display information about each version of your website, such as the ratio of customers who subscribe to those who unsubscribe. Review your design guide to understand where these tables will fit into your application: In this design guide, the TableChart components come after the pie charts you created in the last lesson. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-tables/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-tables/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named totals.js: bash Copy $ touch totals.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a component called VersionTotals to hold your first TableChart and some mock data: import React from 'react'; import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { const versionATotals = { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } return <TableChart data={[versionATotals]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy TableChart is different from PieChart and LineChart in three big ways. First of all, there are no color or viz metadata attributes in its series. TableChart has a standard visualization, so it ignores things like color, which don't apply. Second, the TableChart series have columns metadata attributes. columns determines the names of the columns on the table. Finally, TableChart series data use neither x nor y values. Instead, they use keys that match the table column and values that determine what goes into the row. Notice that VersionTotals takes a version prop and supplies it to the chart metadata's id and name fields. This allows you to use this same component to create a table for version A and B and eliminate duplicate code. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-tables/ab-test. Step 6 of 8 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 7 of 8 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the TableChart components displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Extra credit There is one more table in the design guide that records past tests. The columns for this table are: End Date: The end date for the test Version A Description: A description for version A Version B Description: A description for version B Winner: The version selected as the final design Try to build this table in your application with these column names and some fake data, without looking at a code sample. This practice will reinforce what you've learned in this lesson. If you need help, review the add-a-chart-group directory of the coursework repository, which corresponds to the next lesson in this course. This has the code for the PastTests component. Each chart you’ll add to your application throughout this course is unique in its type or in the data it presents. So far, you’ve created tables, pie charts, and a line chart, and they all function independently of one another. In the next lesson, you’ll create a couple more line charts, but this time they’ll function together.

      "body": "When you connect your data to New Relic, we process what we receive and apply data dropping and transformation rules. Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and any Log_<value> custom data partition created Metric group: LoggingBytes Log records are stored into the Log event type by default. Additional custom data partitions will create new event types, which are always prefixed with Log_ and will be counted as part of the overall set of log data stored. With LogExtendedRecord, log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. As of September 2021, log storage as blobs replaces LogExtendedRecord. With blob storage, NRDB can store up to 128,000 bytes for any attribute, not just messages. For more information, see our blobs documentation for logs. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent. You are not charged for DistributedTraceSummary events. Browser:EventLog Browser Browser:JSErrors PcvPerf (PageView timing) Browser events Metric group: BrowserEventsBytes Lambda Serverless Metric group: ServerlessBytes Break down data to see what's contributing to your ingest You can inspect your data ingest to gain more information about your ingest health. This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

      "body": "Here is information about using the legacy APM service maps feature to create, customize, and use service maps. For help using the current service maps feature, see How to use service maps. Requirements The legacy service map features in APM depend on your New Relic agent version: Feature Requirements App visibility For your app to appear in service maps, one of the following must be true: Your app must have the minimum agent version required for distributed tracing and have distributed tracing enabled. Note: Mobile monitoring doesn't support distributed tracing yet and will not show relationships to apps that have distributed tracing enabled. Your app must have the minimum APM agent version required for cross app tracing and have cross app tracing enabled. Host and instance visibility To view specific hosts, instances, and types of database information, your agent must meet the same minimum agent versions as the APM database and instance feature and use any of the compatible database drivers. Database-only visibility APM's service maps feature includes the ability to opt out of the deeper, host and instance level view. However, to view databases in service maps without the instance-level details, you must still meet the same minimum agent versions as the Database and slow queries features. Create maps The APM service maps feature helps you create your first map by providing default map or architecture suggestions that automatically build a default map (if you have more than ten reporting apps). To view these suggested maps, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service Maps > Suggested maps. To create a new map: Do one of the following: Start from scratch: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Create new map . Copy an existing map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > Save as new. Name your map. Rearrange, group, or add nodes on the map as needed. Important Previously, you could have private service maps. Now, all users can view, edit, and delete all existing or new service maps in the account. Save and rename maps Here are some tips about saving and renaming maps: Save To save changes to a map, select Save. To create a copy of the current map, select Save as new. Rename To rename a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the pencil icon next to the map name. Change the name, then select Save. Add or remove nodes on maps After you create or save a map, build out your map by adding nodes to it. Nodes are added to the map differently based on the node type. To remove any node from the map, mouse over the node, then select the remove X icon. Applications and mobile apps Nodes for applications or mobile apps need to be added to the map in order to add any other nodes. Nodes are added and connected into the map as you select them. The check mark icon means that node is already on the map. To add New Relic monitored apps or plugins to maps: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. Select any applications from the App/Service list. Rearrange or group together as needed. Browser, databases, external services, connected apps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. To add browser apps, databases, external services, or other connected apps to the map: Select an incoming or outgoing connection widget. From the list of connections, mouse over an app or service, then select the plus icon. Rearrange as needed. Custom nodes To add a custom node to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. From the App/Service list, select Create custom node. Name the node. Add connections: Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. Then select the plus icon on your target node. Select Save. Rearrange as needed. To add or remove custom node connections: Mouse over the custom node and select the pencil icon. Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. To add a connection, select the plus icon. To remove a connection, select the minus icon. Select Save. Move around the map Move around the map by panning or zooming in and out. If you want to... Do this... Pan the map In pan mode, click and drag. In drag-select mode, hold the Alt key, then click and drag. Zoom in and out In either mode, zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel. View your entire map in traffic light mode Zoom out until node details fade out and are replaced by health status colors. Toggle the traffic light view on and off Select Views, then select Traffic light mode. View all the nodes and their dependencies Select Discover your environment. Drill down into more detail from a node Use standard UI functions. Select, arrange, group nodes Click on a node to select it and view its performance summary. You can also select multiple nodes at once, to group and ungroup them: Select nodes To select one node, click on the node. To select multiple nodes: Click the drag-select icon to switch to drag-select mode. Click and drag the mouse to draw a square around the nodes you want to select. OR Hold the Shift key and click on each node you want to select. Arrange nodes Caution Auto-arrange cannot be undone. Consider saving a copy of your map first. To arrange nodes on the map, select one or more node, then drag to a snap point on the map. To automatically organize all your nodes and connections, select Auto-arrange map. Group and ungroup nodes If you want to... Do this... Group nodes together on the map Select two or more nodes, then select Create group. Name your new group Mouse over the group, then select the pencil icon. Rename an existing group Select the pencil icon. Remove nodes from a group Select the group, then select the minus icon for each item you want to remove. Add maps and charts to dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: adding a service map to a dashboard provides context for the data being reported and where it's coming from. You can add legacy service maps to a dashboard. For example, if you have a dashboard showcasing performance metrics for several entities, adding a service map to the dashboard shows how all the entities are related and provides additional context about your system. To add a service map to a dashboard: Go to one.newrelic.com and select the Explorer. Select an entity from the index. Click on Service map. Click Add to dashboard. Search for the dashboard you want to add the map to. Delete maps To delete a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the map name's pencil icon. Select Delete map. Identify issues with external services If your app connects to an external service that New Relic does not monitor (for example, a third-party API), New Relic watches the service for a week in order to baseline its response time. If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator: Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline. Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline. Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline. Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status. Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status. Visualize and monitor complex architectures Use service maps to visualize and monitor complex architectures. For a tutorial introducing the latest features, select the service map's question icon. Nodes Nodes are the basic building blocks for your map. You can add a variety of node types including: Node type Description New Relic APM-monitored app Add your app to the map to view their connections to databases, browser apps, out-of-process services, and other instrumented apps. (In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are also referred to as web external or background external data.) Browser apps Automatically detected for each app and added via the incoming connections widget. Only displays browser apps linked to an APM app (standalone browser apps are not supported). New Relic mobile monitoring apps Automatically detected and added via the app/service list panel. Plugins, including Databases Automatically detected for each app and added via the connections widget. Databases in service maps require the same agent versions as the new Database page features. External services Service maps automatically detects external services (visible in the connections widget), to track your app's external dependencies and monitor the health of those connections. Custom nodes Add custom nodes via the app/service list panel to include apps and services not automatically instrumented by New Relic (for example, load balancers, implementation planning, and so on). Group nodes A group node contains multiple other nodes. For apps, group nodes include a summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. Node arrangement and grouping Click and drag a node to move it around the map, for a customizable view of your architecture. App nodes can also be grouped together into a single node to better organize related apps and services. Grouped nodes include summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. To remove items from a group, mouse over the group and select the pencil pencil icon, then select the minus minus-circle icon to remove the item from the group. Incoming and outgoing connections Service maps automatically detects incoming and outgoing connections based on HTTP calls between entities. Mouse over a node to highlight the node's connections. Widgets at the end of each node display a count of that node's connections, and you can click on those widgets to add related entities to the map: View performance summary Click on an app to view its performance over the last 30 minutes. The chart defaults to Response time, but you can view other metrics by selecting any of the available Apdex, Throughput, or Error rate links. While charts use the last 30 minutes of performance data, the service map as a whole is based on the last five minutes. View the app in APM or browser and view its labels by selecting the overflow ellipsis-v icon. Click the app name again to hide the summary charts, and select the overflow ellipsis-h icon again to hide other details. Map list and app/service list panels Select the Map list panel to: Search for and view your maps, and access other users' shared maps. Create a new map. Select the App/Service List panel to: Add new apps, mobile apps, and plugins to your map. Create custom nodes and add them to the map. Health status and performance metrics You can see health status indicators for most nodes. Except for out-of-process services (external services or background services), entities use the health status indicators used by New Relic Alerts. For out-of-process (external) services, the health status indicator measures the health of the connection to the external service. View all connected apps and services The Discover your environment feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment. To view all connected apps and services: In APM, select Service maps. From your Map list, select Discover your environment to display all of your nodes. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details. The Discover your environment feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See Troubleshooting cross application tracing for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements. Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Discover your environment: Use this option to view all of your nodes and their dependencies in one place. Traffic light mode Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Traffic light mode. When traffic lights mode is On, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default. When traffic lights mode is Off, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out. one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Views > Traffic light mode: When traffic light mode is enabled, zooming out of your service map displays nodes in health status colors. Midnight mode Midnight mode inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Midnight mode.",

      "body": "Your New Relic users can be on one of two user models: this doc explains the New Relic One user model. Important If your New Relic organization was created before July 30 2020 and you haven't gone through a user migration process, your users are likely on our original user model. For more on this, see User model changes. Overview This doc will explain the structure of the New Relic One user model, including: User type (basic user versus full user) Default user groups, including Admin and User Roles and capabilities For how to add and manage users in the UI, see User management. User type: basic and full Important This section is for users on our New Relic One user model. If you're on our original user model, see Original users. A user's user type determines if they have access to our basic features (basic user) or can access all of our curated observability UI features (full user). The user type is something meant to be set long-term based on that user's expected New Relic responsibilities. Below are details on the two user types. Note that full users are billable only if you're on New Relic One pricing. Basic user. Details: These users are free and have access to a wide range of features, including setting up and configuring any New Relic data-reporting tool, running queries of your data, using our logs UI, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. Unlike full users, they do not have access to our more curated observability UI experiences or some Applied Intelligence features (for a detailed comparison, see Capabilities). Basic users will see prompts to become a full user when they attempt to access unavailable features. For details, see Upgrade. Full user. Details: Full users have access to everything (depending on any role restrictions), including all our observability UI experiences, such as APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, synthetic monitors, access to New Relic One apps, and more. For details, see Capabilities. Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total full users. A full user can downgrade to a basic user twice in a 12-month period. To view and edit the user type of your users, use the User management UI. Learn more about basic user versus full user differences: Compare full vs basic capabilities Below is a table comparing what basic users and full users can do. A simple way to think about it is that full users have theoretical access (dependent on any chosen role restrictions) to all of our curated UI experiences, while basic users are restricted to fairly basic capabilities. Features Full user Basic user Observability UI experiences Application performance monitoring (APM) UI Infrastructure monitoring UI Digital Experience Monitoring UI, which includes: Browser monitoring UI Mobile monitoring UI Synthetic monitoring UI Synthetics checks Serverless monitoring UI Logs in context Distributed tracing Infinite Tracing (Pro and Enterprise edition) Assorted UI experiences, including: Kubernetes cluster explorer UI Key transaction UI Workloads UI Manage other users Access to New Relic One apps Can build apps but can't access other apps Applied Intelligence Automatic anomaly detection Correlated alerts and events Anomaly/alert analysis Root cause details in issues Basic platform capabilities Data ingest from any source (agents, integrations, APIs) Query your data Create custom charts and dashboards Alerts and notifications Our APIs, including NerdGraph (GraphQL) (with some restrictions) Query and chart log data Build New Relic One apps (but cannot access other apps) Encryption at rest Standard data retention Security and compliance Data management Note that the pricing edition (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise) will also affect what features you have access to. For organizations with New Relic One pricing, learn more about how full users impact billing. Tips on choosing user type A user's type (basic user vs full user) is meant to be a long-term assignment, based on the New Relic responsibilities that user is expected to perform. A full user can be downgraded to a basic user only twice in one year. Below are tips for why you'd choose full user versus basic user. Reasons to make someone a full user: They play a key role in the development, testing, deployment, and maintenance phases of the application development lifecycle. They break/fix code regularly; they are responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team. They have DevOps practices (i.e. version control systems and implement CI/CD). They need to use New Relic's curated dashboards and experiences (not just the ability to create their own custom queries and charts); in other words, they need full access to our platform. They need to be able to manage users and/or billing. Reasons to make someone a basic user: They play a key role in the planning phase of the application development lifecycle. They use and configure New Relic agents, APIs, and integrations to send us data, and access, configure, and use alerts on such data (not necessarily responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team). They want to see high-level analytics and business metrics for future planning (such as C-Suite executives). They do not need to use our curated experiences and dashboards, but would benefit from the ability to create their own custom queries and charts of data; in other words, they don't need full access to the platform. They don't manage users. For accounts on New Relic One pricing, learn more about user-related billing calculations. Understand user-related billing If you're on the New Relic One pricing plan, full users are billable, and there are restrictions around how often a full user can downgrade to a basic user. For details, see User count billing details. For how to query and alert on usage data, see Query usage data. Have questions about why you can't access something? See Factors affecting access. Default groups: Admin and User For users on our New Relic One user model, a \"group\" is what allows the grouping together and managing of multiple users at the same time. Your New Relic users are assigned to a group, and that group is granted access to specific roles on specific accounts. We have two default groups: User: This group allows a user to use and configure monitoring/analysis features but not perform account-related tasks like managing billing or users. It has access to the All product admin role, which gives access to our observability platform tools but not to the organization and user management capabilities governed by the Organization manager and Authentication manager roles. Admin: has full access and capabilities, including the organization-level admin abilities. This is the equivalent of having the All product admin, the Billing user, the Organization manager and the Authentication domain manager roles. These groups are added inside your default authentication domain, which includes the default settings of users a) being managed via New Relic and b) logging in via standard email and password. If you add other authentication domains (for SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning of users), you'd have new custom groups in those new domains to govern those users. Note that groups, whether default or custom, are not what limit a user's capabilities: it is the role that is assigned to that group (with any basic user restrictions on top of that). If your organization is Pro or Enterprise edition and you want to understand how users are granted access to specific roles and accounts, see Access grants. To change the group a user is in, use the User management UI. How do user type, roles, and groups relate to each other? For users on the New Relic One user model, here's a table explaining how user type (basic vs full user), roles, and groups relate to each other: Full user Basic user Group Full users can be assigned to default groups (User and Admin) or custom groups. When basic users are added to a group, that group's role-related restrictions apply. A basic user's capabilities can be restricted in that way, but a basic user can never be granted more capabilities than they start with. For Standard edition, basic users can't be assigned to groups. For Pro and Enterprise edition, they can. Role For an explanation of the roles our default groups have, see Default groups. Custom groups can have either our default standard roles, or custom roles. A basic user's abilities aren't directly defined by a specific role. A basic user can best be described as having the All product admin role but without access to our more curated UI experiences (learn more about user type). When basic users are added to a group, that group's role-related restrictions apply, but a basic user can never be granted more capabilities than they start with. Roles and capabilities For users on the New Relic One user model, a \"role\" can be defined as \"a set of capabilities.\" A capability is defined as the ability to do a specific New Relic task, like 'Delete alert conditions' (learn more about capabilities). Roles are assigned to user groups. Our default groups Admin and User already have our standard roles (defined below) assigned. Organizations on Pro or Enterprise edition can also create custom roles. Standard (default) roles Roles are sets of capabilities. We have several \"standard roles,\" which are roles that satisfy some commonly needed use cases. To view roles and their associated capabilities, use the Organization and access UI. Important Note that some of our standard roles have hidden, non-exposed capabilities that are not available for selection when creating a custom role. The only standard roles that can be replicated with a custom role are Standard user and Read only; all others have some hidden capabilities. Our standard roles include: Standard roles Scope Description All product admin Account Provides admin-level access to observability platform features but not organization-level and user management features. In other words, this role includes all New Relic capabilities with the exception of managing users (Authentication domain manager role), managing organization/account-structure settings (Organization manager role), and managing billing (Billing user role). Note: the Standard user role is essentially the All product admin role minus observability feature configuration capabilities. Standard user Account Provides access to observability platform features, but lacks permissions for configuring those features (for example, ability to configure synthetic monitor secure credentials) and lacks organization-level and user management permissions. Note: the Standard user role is essentially the All product admin role without that role's ability to configure platform features. Billing user Account Provides ability to manage subscriptions and billing setup, and read-only access to the rest of the platform. For organizations with multiple accounts, billing is aggregated in the primary (first-created) account, which is why assigning this role to that primary account grants billing permissions for the entire organization. Organization manager Organization Provides the ability to manage organization settings, including organization structure, name, and preferences. Due to our recent switch to the New Relic One user model, this role currently has few abilities but more will be added over time. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Organization read only Organization Provides the ability to view organization-level settings. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Authentication domain manager Organization Provides ability to add and manage users, and configure authentication domains for users on the New Relic One user model. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Authentication domain read only Organization Provides the ability to view users in your organization and view the configuration of authentication domains. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Read only Account Provides read-only access to the New Relic platform (except for synthetic monitor secure credentials). Manage v1 users Account For New Relic organizations that existed before July 30 2020 and have users on our original user model, this role lets you manage those \"v1\" users. For more about how you'd assign roles to groups and create custom roles, see the user management tutorial. Capabilities A role, whether one of our standard roles or a custom role, is defined as a set of capabilities. To view roles and their associated capabilities, use the Organization and access UI. Important Some of our standard roles have hidden capabilities that aren't available for selection when creating a custom role. For details, see Standard roles. A view of the capabilities associated with the All product admin role. When creating a custom role, you select a custom set of capabilities. Note that the capabilities we expose may change over time: this screenshot was taken in April of 2021. For how to set up roles with custom capabilities, see the user management tutorial. Manage users To learn how to add users, assign them to groups, and create custom groups and roles, see Manage users. 2020 user model changes If you'd like to understand how our user model changed in 2020 and what the impacts of that change were, see User model changes.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add pie charts, before starting this one. In each hands-on lesson in this course, you have been adding something new to your A/B test application. You’ve spun up a new launcher and added multiple chart components to your Nerdlet. In this lesson, you’ll create two new TableChart components that display information about each version of your website, such as the ratio of customers who subscribe to those who unsubscribe. Review your design guide to understand where these tables will fit into your application: In this design guide, the TableChart components come after the pie charts you created in the last lesson. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-tables/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-tables/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named totals.js: bash Copy $ touch totals.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a component called VersionTotals to hold your first TableChart and some mock data: import React from 'react'; import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { const versionATotals = { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } return <TableChart data={[versionATotals]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy TableChart is different from PieChart and LineChart in three big ways. First of all, there are no color or viz metadata attributes in its series. TableChart has a standard visualization, so it ignores things like color, which don't apply. Second, the TableChart series have columns metadata attributes. columns determines the names of the columns on the table. Finally, TableChart series data use neither x nor y values. Instead, they use keys that match the table column and values that determine what goes into the row. Notice that VersionTotals takes a version prop and supplies it to the chart metadata's id and name fields. This allows you to use this same component to create a table for version A and B and eliminate duplicate code. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-tables/ab-test. Step 6 of 8 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 7 of 8 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the TableChart components displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Extra credit There is one more table in the design guide that records past tests. The columns for this table are: End Date: The end date for the test Version A Description: A description for version A Version B Description: A description for version B Winner: The version selected as the final design Try to build this table in your application with these column names and some fake data, without looking at a code sample. This practice will reinforce what you've learned in this lesson. If you need help, review the add-a-chart-group directory of the coursework repository, which corresponds to the next lesson in this course. This has the code for the PastTests component. Each chart you’ll add to your application throughout this course is unique in its type or in the data it presents. So far, you’ve created tables, pie charts, and a line chart, and they all function independently of one another. In the next lesson, you’ll create a couple more line charts, but this time they’ll function together. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. When you're ready, continue on to the next lesson: Add a chart group.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add chart components to your A/B test application, before starting this one. In this course, you’re building an A/B test application for the New Relic platform. Previously, you learned about the New Relic One SDK and its component library. Now, It’s time for you to start building your application focusing first on chart components. Before you write any code, consult your design guide to remember what the application will look like when you finish: There are several charts you need to create, which may seem overwhelming at first, but take it one step at a time. The topmost chart, and the first you’ll create, is a line chart that shows the number of users who sign up for your newsletter and what version of your website they were shown. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-your-first-chart/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-your-first-chart/ab-test This directory contains the code your application should have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named newsletter-signups.js: bash Copy $ touch newsletter-signups.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a component called NewsletterSignups to hold your first LineChart and some mock data: import React from 'react'; import { LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } const versionBSignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-b-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 20 }, { x: 10, y: 5 }, { x: 20, y: 25 }, { x: 30, y: 45 }, { x: 40, y: 50 }, { x: 50, y: 35 }, ], } return <LineChart data={[versionASignups, versionBSignups]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Here, you’ve created two arbitrary data series which represent versions A and B of your test. Right now, you're using manually-crafted data points. In the future, you'll replace these with data queried from New Relic. Notice that you’ve specified a color for each series in the chart. The color metadata attribute takes any CSS-acceptable color format. Setting viz: 'main' means that you want to render the LineChart series as a line, the component's default display style. For the data prop in the LineChart component, you passed the two series in an array so that both are represented together. Finally, you used the chart’s fullWidth prop to stretch the chart’s width to fill the view. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and replace the default heading in your Nerdlet's render() method with your new component: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-your-first-chart/ab-test.

This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 7 of 8 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the LineChart displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. In seven steps, you’ve breathed life into your New Relic One application. Instead of a bland “Hello world” message, your application now shows a colorful line chart with two mocked data series. These data series represent server-side traffic for each of the competing designs in your demo website. In the next lesson, you’ll build on this foundation by creating another chart type.

Customize the date and time format for tables and billboards: for each type of data, you can select if you want to leave it as it is, or modify the format as Numeric or Date. If data is a timestamp, you can choose how to represent the date and time: For numbers, select if you want us to auto-format them, or chose the number of decimals you want to see. Customize the Y axis Tip For line and area charts. On line charts and area charts you can adjust the Y axis to display the data within certain values by setting a minimum and maximum value for the axis. If no customization option is selected, dashboards automatically displays the full Y axis from 0 to the top value plus a margin. Enable or disable the legend Tip For line and area charts, and histograms. For line charts, area charts, and histograms, you can disable or enable the legend. Remove the other groups facet Tip For bar and pie charts, and tables. When faceting on bar charts, pie charts, or tables, and if the number of faceting on queries is larger than 2,000, the Other groups facet aggregates the rest of facets. With this customization you can select whether to see Other groups, or remove it. More chart-specific features For more chart type-specific features, see Chart types. Chart share and view options Most charts have various options, including a chart-embed option, getting a chart as an image, and adding a chart to a dashboard. To read about general chart options, see Basic UI features.",

      "body": "When building a query using the query builder, there are a variety of types of visualizations for presenting your data in the optimal format. This table contains all chart types. Whether a chart type is available for your query will be dependent on: The type of query (some query results don't match some chart types) The query mode (basic or advanced) Area chart An area chart shows a time series for a single attribute. The area chart type shows a time series for a single attribute. To enable an area chart, add a FACET to your query. You can use facet to add up to five attributes, separated by commas. Use the TIMESERIES function when you use a FACET in an NRQL query. Use an area chart when you want to View the measurement of a single attribute over a period of time that you specify. Avoid an area chart when you want to View a chart that contains more than a single attribute. The line chart type is a good option; you can view multiple attributes over a time range that you specify. The bar chart type gives you a comparison view between the attributes; it uses a total of each attribute for the time range you choose. Bar chart The bar chart shows comparisons among the categories returned in the query results. The bar chart compares a related set of values. To enable a bar chart, add a FACET clause to the query. You can use FACET with up to 5 different attributes, separated by commas. Use a bar chart when you want to Create a chart that reports the total count of the data for a category over the specified time range. With the bar chart format, you can easily see the differences between each category. Avoid a bar chart when you want to Include measurements over a period of time. This chart type is not available when using a TIMESERIES clause. The line chart type is a good option for this visualization. Billboard The billboard chart type presents results as a single, highly-visible value. It's an option when your query returns a single number, such as from this query: SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView since 1 day ago Copy A billboard chart is useful for single-stat queries like the Apdex function. Use billboards to monitor values at a glance. Billboards can also be used to compare a single value across states. For instance, use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the same attribute across two different time frames. The billboard chart displays a single value in a large, easy to read font. To enable the data for a billboard chart, search for a single value. You can view multiple values by adding a facet from the dropdown. You can set Warning and Critical thresholds on billboards, which will highlight a chart in yellow or red. The threshold fields are on the right side of the chart edit pane, highlighted in yellow and red respectively. If you want to highlight a chart when a value falls below a given value rather than above it, set the Warning threshold higher than the Critical threshold. Tip Threshold fields will only be available for dashboards that present a single value. For instance, the use of a COMPARE WITH clause will disable the threshold settings in the edit pane. Use a billboard chart when you want to Monitor values, including thresholds for Critical and Warning states, in a large, easy-to-read font. Avoid a billboard chart type when You want to view data over a period of time. The line chart type is a better option for viewing data by time. Bullet chart Use the bullet chart type to represent progress to a target or goal, called the limit. To use this chart type, run a query that returns a single number, such as: SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The bullet chart displays a value compared against a limit. Bullet defaults to a limit that is twice the resulting query value. To adjust the limit, use the Limit field to enter another number. The bullet will adjust accordingly. Tip The bullet chart type can only be used for charts that present a single value. For example, a query using COMPARE WITH will not list bullet as an option. Use a bullet chart when you want to View a chart uses a large, easy-to-read font that helps you view the value quickly. Avoid a bullet chart when you want to View data that has more than a single value. Bar and line chart types may be better choices in this instance. Funnel Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data types that make up the steps toward a specified goal. A funnel allows you to ask, “Of the people that did (A), how many also did (B), and of the people that did (A) and (B), how many also completed (C)?” Sample funnel chart for a shopping site. In this example, you want to determine that of all the visitors that viewed the landing page, how many of them: Browsed the products. Then added one or more products to a shopping cart. And finally, purchased the item(s) in the shopping cart. Unlike other queries, you must use a SELECT funnel() statement in your query; the funnel chart type is not selectable from any other type of query. Additionally, the funnel chart type is only available for queries with eight steps or fewer. A funnel query that includes more than eight steps will only return the results as JSON. SELECT funnel(session, WHERE pageUrl like '%/index.html' AS 'Landing', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/browse/phones' AS 'Browse ', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/shoppingcart' AS 'Cart', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/checkout' AS 'Purchased') FROM PageView where appName = 'WebPortal' AND duration < 1 SINCE 1 week ago Copy Use a funnel when you want to You want to visually evaluate the paths that visitors take after they hit a page that you designate as a landing page. Avoid a funnel when you want to You only want counts for the attributes in the WHERE clause. You will not be able to choose funnel unless you use SELECT funnel in your query. Heat map The heat map displays data in a tabular format using color gradations to show frequency in specific time buckets. The heat map is a faceted distribution of values where color density represents the values displayed. To enable a heat map, use the Histogram() function with a numeric attribute and use FACET to add up to five attributes, separated by commas. See Histograms: View data distribution for more detailed information about histogram-based charts. Use a heat map when you want to View tabular data for multiple attributes over a period of time, with gradated colors instead of numerals. Avoid a heat map when you want to View the exact data for multiple attributes over a period of time. A line or bar chart may be an option. Histogram A histogram charts frequency across a series of value ranges. Use histograms to show the distribution of data across time buckets. See Histograms: View data distribution for more detailed information about histogram-based charts. Use a histogram when you want to Chart frequency of data over a series of values. Avoid a histogram when you want to View the same data as heat map or to view the data without the time buckets. JSON Use the returned JSON to review the raw data returned and to help develop integrations with New Relic. To implement integrations, use remote queries to return raw JSON as a service. To use this, select the Share menu and click Copy JSON. Example NRQL query: SELECT uniqueCount(name) FROM Transaction WHERE httpResponseCode = '200' TIMESERIES FACET appName LIMIT 10 SINCE 24 hours ago Copy Example JSON response: { \"metadata\": { \"contents\": { \"messages\": [], \"timeSeries\": { \"messages\": [], \"contents\": [ { \"function\": \"uniquecount\", \"attribute\": \"name\", \"simple\": true } ] }, \"bucketSizeMillis\": 1800000 }, \"eventTypes\": [ \"Transaction\" ], \"eventType\": \"Transaction\", \"openEnded\": true, \"messages\": [], \"beginTimeMillis\": 1556226069396, \"endTimeMillis\": 1556312469396, \"beginTime\": \"2019-04-25T21:01:09Z\", \"endTime\": \"2019-04-26T21:01:09Z\", \"guid\": \"5238a2c6-328d-a5ff-9185-7f3f04c42d1e\", \"routerGuid\": \"1aea2ec5-0be8-3a60-7554-851e1b016eb0\", \"rawSince\": \"24 HOURS AGO\", \"rawUntil\": \"NOW\", \"rawCompareWith\": \"\", \"facet\": \"appName\", \"offset\": 0, \"limit\": 10 }, \"facets\": [ { \"name\": \"RPM Combined Production\", \"beginTimeSeconds\": 0, \"endTimeSeconds\": 0, \"timeSeries\": [ { \"results\": [ { \"uniqueCount\": 415 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 1556226069, \"endTimeSeconds\": 1556227869, \"inspectedCount\": 4589471 }, [ { \"uniqueCount\": 1714 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 1556310669, \"endTimeSeconds\": 1556312469, \"inspectedCount\": 53341469 } ], \"total\": { \"results\": [ { \"uniqueCount\": 2651 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 0, \"endTimeSeconds\": 0, \"inspectedCount\": 5053841114 } }, \"performanceStats\": { \"inspectedCount\": 6088068932, \"responseTime\": 8077 } } ... Copy Line A line chart is useful for spotting trends over time. The line chart plots a timeseries for an attribute. When working in basic query mode, select a single attribute you can plot over time. When using NRQL, SELECT one or more attributes you can plot over time and then use the TIMESERIES function. Use a line chart when you want to Create a chart that lets you easily view trends over a specified time frame. Avoid a line chart when you want to View your data using one or more attributes and see the values associated with each attribute. A bar or table chart is an option. Pie chart A pie chart is the graphic representation of the table. It appears as an option for some functions when the FACET clause is used. To use this chart type, run a query that returns one value for each of a set of attributes. The pie chart maps a set of values as a portion of a whole. To enable pie chart, add a FACET from the dropdown. You can add only one FACET in basic query mode. If you're using NRQL, you can use FACET to add up to 5 attributes, separated by commas, and also include the TIMESERIES function. Pie charts are unavailable for the following aggregator functions: average, apdex, min, max, percentage, and percentile. For uniqueCount, percentages may add up to more than 100%. Use a pie chart when you want to Create a chart that that graphically presents a set of values as they relate to a whole. A pie chart is effective for displaying values for a time period, for example. Avoid a pie chart when you want to Present data that does not use values as they related to a whole, such as with line charts. Pie chart percentage problem When using a pie chart with the uniqueCount aggregator function, the percentages can add up to more than 100%. This is because the attributes being uniquely counted may be present in multiple facets. For example, in the query SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView FACET appName, a single unique user may use multiple apps. Each of these users are included in the unique value for each of the appropriate facets (apps), but the total number of unique users won't change. To solve this, use a bar chart or table to provide a more accurate visualization of uniqueCount data. Table A table is the standard view for a set of values related to a specific attribute (for example, the count of all page views by user agent name). By default, all tables are sortable by any one column. If you are using the FACET clause, the results will normally be returned as a table. Other features of tables: You can use a table as a shortcut to other dashboards. If a table is faceted by attribute, selecting an entry takes you to an existing dashboard filtered by that attribute. You can export a table chart to a CSV file. Details on this functionality: If a filter is applied to a dashboard, the download will only include the subset of data based on the filter. If a specific fixed time range is selected, the CSV includes the data for that time period. If you query with multiple attributes, the export includes columns for all FACETs in the query. For charts with a time range dependent on the present moment (for example, since 30 minutes ago), the data in the CSV is generated from the present moment, not from when the chart was initially generated. The table chart type, with its tabular format, works well for dashboards, as well as sharing the data for use in reports, for example. Use a table when you want to Create a text-compatible table consisting of your data. This table can be shared and used in reports or imported into spreadsheets, for example. Avoid a table when you want to View your data in a graphical format.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version If you already had the CLI, update it: bash Copy $ nr1 update Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start. You’re ready to build an application with the New Relic One CLI! Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "Imagine you've developed a website and instrumented it with New Relic's Browser monitoring. New Relic's core feature set provides a lot of information, but you want something custom. You want to decide if a new design for your site will better engage your users. In other words, you want to A/B test a design and make a decision based on the data. For this task, you could create a New Relic One application, using React, the New Relic One software development kit, and the limitless power of modern web technologies. New Relic One applications are built with one of web development's most popular JavaScript libraries: React. Because you have freedom when writing React code, you can customize your app logic, design your own components, or take advantage of the abundance of open source component libraries. So, for your A/B test app, if you want to write custom logic to end the test based on results, you can do so. The New Relic One software development kit (SDK) allows you to create, serve, publish, and deploy applications to New Relic One. It also provides a host of React components for gathering data, presenting information, handling user interactions, and more. You use components like Button and Dropdown to create an interactive experience that looks and feels native to New Relic. You use Table and Chart components to display data from your New Relic account or elsewhere. When building your A/B test application, you'd use the SDK's NrqlQuery component to fetch Browser data from your account. With custom React code, SDK components, and the wide world of open source libraries, you can create your A/B test application in New Relic One. But before you create one for yourself, you might want to check the app catalog to see if someone has beaten you to it! If the catalog already had an app for that, you could add it to your account with a couple clicks, another benefit of creating apps in New Relic One. Throughout this course, you’re going to build a real-world New Relic One application for running and managing A/B tests. You’ll visualize Browser data for your competing designs, see historical data from past tests, and even choose a winning design and end the test, all from your New Relic One application! But before you get into the weeds of building charts and making http requests, you need to learn what New Relic One applications are made of.

It also makes use of newrelic_telemetry_sdk to send telemetry data to New Relic. A simulator service that generates dummy database traffic so you don't have to manually perform CRUD operations To spin up these services, you first need to set NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY environment variable. Prepare your environment On your local machine, set your license key in an environment variable: bash Copy $ export NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY=<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Your mock database uses this key to write telemetry data to New Relic.

      "body": "Every time you deploy an application, you hope that it's efficient and error-free. The reality, however, is usually quite different. You might introduce a bug in a release, overlook an edge case, or rely on a broken dependency. These issues, and others, can result in bad user experiences. In this guide, you: Use the open-source New Relic demo-deployer to spin up the infrastructure for Acme Telco Lite, a fictional company. This demo scenario is part of our Demo Catalog and will simulate real-world issues in a controlled, demo environment Use New Relic to understand those issues from the perspective of a Telco Lite developer Use the deployer to tear down the resources you create Welcome to Acme Telco Lite! Acme Telco Lite is a mock telecom business that maintains an eCommerce website for its customers. The site's architecture has eight, interconnected microservices, plus a simulator: The simulator isn't part of the Telco Lite infrastructure, but it is part of the demo deployment. It runs scenarios against the application to create web traffic and generate interesting data in New Relic. Set up your environment Before you begin, follow the Prerequisites guide from the deployer's GitHub repository for a detailed walkthrough of how to set up your environment. For this guide, you can choose between Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host your deployment. The guide steps you through: Installing Docker & pulling the demo-deployer image locally Creating a user config file containing credentials for New Relic and your cloud provider Downloading a .pem key file (if your cloud provider is AWS) Once you're all set up, deploy Acme Telco Lite. Deploy Telco Lite It's time to deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services using demo-deployer. Copy the url for the demo that corresponds to the cloud provider you chose when you set up your environment: AWS Telco Lite Demo Azure Telco Lite Demo GCP Telco Lite Demo Follow the Deployment guide in the Demo Catalog repository for a thorough explanation of how to use the deployer in a local Docker environment. When you run the deployment script, make sure to pass the url you copied for <demo-url>. Tip Since Telco Lite contains several services, the deployment can take over half an hour. When the deloyer is finished, you should see some output stating that the deployment was successful: bash Copy [INFO] Executing Deployment [✔] Parsing and validating Deployment configuration success [✔] Provisioner success [✔] Installing On-Host instrumentation success [✔] Installing Services and instrumentations success [INFO] Deployment successful!

View your services With your services running in the cloud, log in to New Relic and select APM from the top navigation to see how your services are holding up: Yikes! The alerts, high response times, and red-colored indicators suggest things aren't well. Use New Relic to diagnose these issues, which are simultaneously affecting your services: Issue 1: The Warehouse Portal has abnormally high response times Issue 2: Multiple services are raising error alerts Tip Don't worry if you don't see all the same alerts. The simulator triggers issues at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. Tear down Telco Lite When you're finished diagnosing all the issues effecting Telco Lite, follow the Teardown guide in the deployer's repository to tear down the services you created in your cloud provider. If you're still exploring, don't tear down your services, or you'll have to deploy them again later. Conclusion Congratulations, you're done! Throughout this tutorial, you: Used the demo-deployer to deploy Telco Lite to the cloud Used New Relic to investigate simulated issues in Telco Lite services Tore down all the infrastructural resources you created throughout this tutorial Hopefully, you learned a lot about using New Relic to investigate issues in your services.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you learned of a third-party service that you can use to fetch mock cancellation data for the Total cancellations per version chart in your New Relic One application. Even though the data in this service is fake, the real value of this lesson is learning how you can use third party services to supply data to your New Relic One application. If you make a request to the mock service with cancellation data (https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations) you'll see a response rejecting your request with a message that reads \"Unauthorized\": bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations Unauthorized This is because the Nerdsletter API requires an Authorization header. More specifically, you must pass a bearer token of ABC123 to gain authorized access to its data. If you make a request to the service with the header Authorization: Bearer ABC123, you'll get a successful response with the mocked cancellation data: bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations -H 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' {\"a\": 15, \"b\": 78} In the last lesson, you used NerdGraph to store this API token in your New Relic One application's NerdStorageVault data store. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component and logged its use to your browser's console. In this lesson, you follow up that log statement with a real request to the Nerdsletter API using your authorization token. Then, you supply the data from that external resource to your Total cancellations per version chart. Step 1 of 6 Change to the third-party-services/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/third-party-services/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 6 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js, make a request to api.nerdsletter.net with your API token. Save the results to state, and use that state in render(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { cancellations: [], lastToken: null } } generateChartData(data) { const cancellationsA = data ? data.a : 0; const cancellationsB = data ? data.b : 0; return [ { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsA }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsB }, ], }, ] } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`Requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) fetch( \"https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations\", {headers: {\"Authorization\": `Bearer ${this.props.token}`}} ).then( (response) => { if (response.status == 200) { return response.json() } else if (response.status == 401) { console.error(\"Incorrect auth header\") } else { console.error(response.text()) } } ).then( (data) => { if (data) { this.setState({ cancellations: this.generateChartData(data), lastToken: this.props.token }) } } ) } } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={this.state.cancellations} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy In this code, you initialize TotalCancellations.state.cancellations with zero for the y-value in each series instead of the previously hardcoded values. This helps to more realistically represent what the chart should show if your New Relic One app hasn't successfully requested data from the Nerdsletter API. Next, you use Javascript's fetch() function to make an HTTP request to the Nerdsletter API. You then pass your token in the request's Authorization header. If the request is successful, you update the cancellation data in TotalCancellations.state so that that data is reflected in the component's render method. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/third-party-service/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. If your token in NerdStorageVault is not \"ABC123\", then your console will show an error that reads, \"Incorrect auth header\": If you set the token to \"ABC123\", then Total cancellations per version updates to show the values from the third-party service: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great job! You've come a long way from running nr1 nerdpack:create for the first time. Take a look back at your design guide to see that your application now has everything from an interface and data perspective that you planned from the beginning: You've created eight charts with varying styles and supplied them with dynamic data from multiple sources. You've learned about the New Relic One SDK and used many of its components. You've even gathered data from a third-party service and mixed it seemlessly with your New Relic data to provide a complete look at how the competing versions in your A/B test perform against each other. From here, there is only one more set of APIs in the New Relic One SDK that you've yet to get your hands on: Platform APIs. These will come in handy in improving the usability of your New Relic One application.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you used PlatformStateContext from the New Relic One SDK to look up the time range that the user selected from the app's time picker. Now, you'll learn about another component that interacts with the New Relic platform: navigation. The navigation component lets you open entities, navigate to entities, and build Location objects for entities from your Nerdlet. You can also use navigation for other Nerdlets and launchers. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-navigation/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In newsletter-signups.js, create a new method, called NewsletterSignups.openApmEntity(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. This method uses navigation.openStackedEntity() to display your demo application's APM entity in a stacked view. Notice openApmEntity() requires your ENTITY_GUID. You need to locate that ID and store it in a constant. Step 3 of 10 Navigate to APM: See metadata for your Newsletter service: Copy the entity's GUID: Create an ENTITY_GUID constant: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and the entity GUID you just copied, respectively. Now, openApmEntity() knows what entity to show. Next, you need to create a button to invoke this method. Step 4 of 10 Create a button to show your APM entity: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you've created a button and configured it to call openApmEntity() when it's clicked. Step 5 of 10 Import Stack and StackItem: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. You'll use Stack and StackItem to lay out the button on the far right side of the same row that the HeadingText is on. Step 6 of 10 Lay out the Stack: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <Stack fullWidth> <StackItem grow={true}> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> </StackItem> <StackItem> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> </StackItem> </Stack> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you used a full-width Stack to set up the layout for the row. To make the HeadingText fill the entire row except the width of the button, you used the StackItem.grow prop. Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. Click App performance: Now you see the stacked entity: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively Congratulations! You're finished writing all the code you'll write for your New Relic One A/B test application. Now, you have an application reporting New Relic data from your demo service that is running an A/B test. You've created several charts, buttons, and other UI elements. And you've organized your components into a readable and usable view. On top of the visuals, you've supplied data to your charts from multiple data sources in and outside of New Relic. You've created some backend functionality which utilizes your New Relic One application's own data store. You've also utilized the platform APIs for interacting with platform UI and showing a stacked entity view. You've really accomplished a lot throughout this course, so far. There are only a few things left to do! First, is to learn how to publish and subscribe to your New Relic One application so that it can run on our platform instead of your own local server. Second, is to learn how to deal with some common issues you might see in New Relic One application development. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Describe your app for the catalog.",

      "body": "This guide steps you through the process of adding access to our time picker in the sample transaction overview application. The sample application provides an overview of the telemetry data showing your account's transactions by application, average response time, HTTP response codes, and transaction errors. When you enable the time picker, users can specify the time range of data to view. We also have a 12 minute video that covers the steps below. Before you begin To develop projects, you need our New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete steps 1–4 of the CLI quick start. In step 1, be sure to make a copy of the number preceding your account name. This is your accound ID, and you’ll need it later. Important If you've already installed the New Relic One CLI, but you can't remember your account ID, start the CLI quick start again, and then click the Get your API key down arrow. The account ID is the number preceding your account name. For additional details, see Set up your development environment. Prepare the time picker sample code To get started, complete these steps to update the application UUID (unique ID) and run the sample application locally: Step 1 of 7 If you haven't already done so, clone the example applications from our how-to GitHub repo. bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git Step 2 of 7 Change to the directory nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet: bash Copy $ cd nr1-how-to/add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet Step 3 of 7 In your preferred text editor, open index.js. Step 4 of 7 Replace <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID> with your account id: Important Your account ID is available in the CLI quick start (see Before you begin). this.accountId = <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID>; Copy Step 5 of 7 Change to the add-time-picker directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/add-time-picker Step 6 of 7 Execute these commands to update the UUID and serve the sample application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 7 of 7 Once the sample application is successfully served, go to the local version of New Relic One (https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local) click Apps, and click Add Time Picker. After launching the Add Time Picker application, you see a dashboard that gives an overview of the transactions in your New Relic account: By default, the application shows your data within the last 60 minutes. If you toggle the time picker, it doesn't update the charts because the transaction overview application isn't connected to the New Relic One platform. It has no access to the data from the time picker. In the following sections, you'll add the time picker to the example application and add the time to the queries. Import the PlatformStateContext component The first step in adding the time picker is to import the PlatformStateContext component. Important If you need more details about the PlatformStateContext example that follows, see the APIs and components page Here's what the PlatformStateContext component does: Wraps all of the code within the return statement of the render method Makes a function call passing in the New Relic platform state Returns all of the code within our current return statement Complete these steps: Step 1 of 5 In a text editor, open /add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet/index.js. Step 2 of 5 Add the PlatformStateContext component to the end of the import statement so it looks like this: import { Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 3 of 5 Just below the current return insert this code for the PlatformStateContext component: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { return ( // ADD THE CURRENT RETURN CODE HERE ) }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> Copy Step 4 of 5 Move the current application code so it is under the return of the platformState function call. The return statement should now look like this: return ( <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> ); Copy Step 5 of 5 Add a console.log statement to make sure you are seeing appropriate data. Insert the following code inside the PlatformState return statement just before the opening tag for the <Grid> component: /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ console.log(platformState); Copy After you complete these steps, your browser console displays something like this: Add the time to the queries In your console, you should see some data from the New Relic platform state. Now you're ready to add timeRange data to update the charts in the transaction overview application. This step requires you to import the timeRangeToNrql utility method from the New Relic One community library. Important You can get more details on the New Relic One community library from our GitHub repo. This helper method takes your PlatformState.timeRange duration data, formats it from milliseconds, and returns a formatted SINCE statement to add to your NRQL. Step 1 of 4 Import the timeRangeToNrql method by inserting this line of code below the other import sections: Important You don't need to include the AccountDropdown from the community import example. import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; Copy Step 2 of 4 Pass the platformState to the timeRangeToNrql helper, and save its output as a since statement for later use: const since = timeRangeToNrql(platformState); Copy Step 3 of 4 After creating the since variable, go through the code in the PlatformStateContext return statement and concatenate the since variable in each of the existing chart component queries. Here's a TableChart example: <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview + since} />; Copy Step 4 of 4 After you update all of the chart components, confirm that the final index.js file looks similar to this: Important This completed sample code is in your nerdlet final.js. import React from 'react'; import { PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart, } from 'nr1'; import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.accountId = 1; } render() { const avgResTime = `SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES AUTO `; const trxOverview = `FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) as 'Transactions', apdex(duration) as 'apdex', percentile(duration, 99, 95) FACET appName `; const errCount = `FROM TransactionError SELECT count(*) as 'Transaction Errors' FACET error.message `; const responseCodes = `SELECT count(*) as 'Response Code' FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode `; return ( <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { /* Taking a peek at the platformState */ console.log(platformState); const since = timeRangeToNrql(platformState); console.log(since); return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount + since} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> ); } } Copy Summary When you completed all the steps in this example, you successfully implemented the time picker in your application by importing the PlatformStateContext component and accessing its timePicker data object.",

      "info": "Intro to New Relic One SDK",
      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: allows you to configure your Nerdlet and write to your Nerdlet's URL state.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add a grid, before starting this one. Organizing charts is one way to clarify the information you're trying to convey to your users. Headings are another. Since you have several charts on the same page, use headings to describe the information they show. To remember what data each chart presents, consult your design guide: The design guide details what data each chart shows. Use those details to craft useful headings for your charts. Step 1 of 6 Change to the add-chart-headings/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-chart-headings/ab-test Step 2 of 6 In newsletter-signups.js, page-views.js, past-tests.js, total-cancellations.js, total-subscriptions.js, and totals.js, import HeadingText and add a descriptive heading above the chart in each of your custom components: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } const versionBSignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-b-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 20 }, { x: 10, y: 5 }, { x: 20, y: 25 }, { x: 30, y: 45 }, { x: 40, y: 50 }, { x: 50, y: 35 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionASignups, versionBSignups]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [ { \"endDate\": \"12-15-2020\", \"versionADescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was green.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was blue.\", \"winner\": \"A\" }, { \"endDate\": \"09-06-2019\", \"versionADescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a carousel.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a grid.\", \"winner\": \"B\" } ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { const versionATotals = { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[versionATotals]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Notice the new <div> tag in each render(), which allows you to return multiple elements at once. Also, remember that we provided you a CSS stylesheet that styles the chartHeader class. You can look at nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss to see more. You don't need to modify your Nerdlet's render() method in index.js because your components encapsulate the new code. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see that your charts have descriptive headings. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Well done! You've created all the charts that are laid out in your design guide. You’ve also organized them into a neat grid and added headings so that the charts are intelligible. While chart headings helps you understand what each chart shows, it'd be nice to add descriptions to help you remember what each version in your A/B test represents. In the next lesson, you'll add a description for each design version. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Add version descriptions.",

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Present an end test confirmation modal, before starting this one. In this series, you're building a full-fledged New Relic One application that ingests data from a demo service that's running an A/B test. The app shows the A/B test data in interesting ways so that you'll ultimately be able to choose whether Version A or Version B is more effective at accomplishing your business goal: to increase high-quality newsletter subscriptions. In past tutorials, you created charts to visualize your data, and you organized those charts so you can use and understand them. You also created a form in your app for ending your test once you're confident in the most effective version. Until now, though, you can't gauge which version is more effective because your charts have been showing mock data, such as: const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } Copy A chart's data prop is useful for supplying manually-crafted data like this or even reformatted third-party data. But for many of your charts, you want to show real-time New Relic data. For example, Newsletter subscriptions by version should show subscription data, which exists in New Relic's database, NRDB for short. To query NRDB, you first need to know what data you're looking for. Remember your demo backend service? Well, that service reports a subscription event to New Relic when a user subscribes to a newsletter from your site. You can view these subscription events in New Relic while your demo services are running. View Subscription Events in New Relic Before you query NRDB from your charts, experiment with querying data from New Relic's web interface. Step 1 of 3 From your New Relic homepage, go to to the Data explorer from the top navigation menu: Data explorer lets you explore your telemetry data: metrics events logs traces Since the backend submits newsletter subscriptions as events to New Relic, you can see them in this view. Step 2 of 3 Select subscription from the Custom events menu: This queries NRDB for subscription event totals per minute over the last 30 minutes and shows that data in a chart: Step 3 of 3 Click Dimensions to see a list of the attributes associated with these subscription events: You can filter and group subscription events using these dimensions. Notice the NRQL query above the chart. This shows the chart's underlying query, which is based on these dimensions. Click the page-version dimension to see the query change to group by FACET page_version: The Data explorer presents two options for filtering and sorting your data: User interface (UI) selections like the one you've just made New Relic Query Language (NRQL) The UI is useful for quickly filtering data, and it doesn't require you to know NRQL. For your New Relic One application, however, you need to use NRQL queries. Click the NRQL query to navigate to the Query builder: Here, you can view and manually edit the query to fetch the data you need. Update NewsletterSignups with a NrqlQuery Before you begin integrating New Relic data in your NR1 app, consult your design guide: Your New Relic One application has eight charts in total, including line charts, pie charts, and table charts. Each of these charts currently shows mock data, but they need to show real data to be useful. First, focus on querying data for the topmost chart: Newsletter subscriptions per version. With the query you've built in the Data explorer, you already have the data you need for this chart: Technical detail In your query, you fetch subscription totals (SELECT count(*) FROM subscriptions), group them by their page version (FACET page_version), and focus the timeseries to the past 30 minutes (SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES). Explore our documentation to learn more about NRQL queries. Next, you learn how to pass your NRQL query to your Newsletter subscriptions per version chart. Step 1 of 7 Change to the add-nrql-components/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nrql-components/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, update the LineChart in NewsletterSignups. Remove the mock data, and use the NRQL query you built in the Data explorer: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. In NrqlQuery, you set two props: accountId: The id for the account you query from query: The query to perform With these, your NR1 app can query the data you want to show in your chart. Tip There is a convenience prop for using NRQL to supply data to your charts, called query. If you'd rather not use the NrqlQuery component, try the query prop instead: <LineChart accountId={<YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID>} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" /> Copy Keep in mind you must still supply the accountId. Step 3 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nrql-components/ab-test. Step 4 of 7 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 7 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 7 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: Newsletter subscriptions by version now shows real data from New Relic's database rather than the mock data you defined before. Notice that your chart pulls data when your application loads, but does not continue pulling data while the application is open. You can fix this by adding another prop. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 7 of 7 Add a pollInterval: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. The pollInterval is the number of milliseconds between chart refreshes. Each time the chart refreshes, it queries fresh data from New Relic. In this case, you refresh every minute. Populate your PieChart with subscription event data Now that you've seen how to passed New Relic data to Newsletter subscriptions per version, it's time to move on to Total subscriptions per version. These two charts are similar in that they compare subscription event data grouped by version. The primary differences between Newsletter subscriptions per version and Total subscriptions per version are: One is a line chart and one is a pie chart One shows timeseries data and one shows all-time totals Step 1 of 2 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js, update the TestDistributions component, removing the mock data and populating the PieChart with the same NRQL query you used for Newsletter subscriptions per version but with different TIMESERIES and SINCE clauses: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, PieChart, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 7 DAYS AGO\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <PieChart data={data} fullWidth /> } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. You don't need the TIMESERIES clause because the pie chart only shows numerical data. You don't need the SINCE clause because Total subscriptions per version needs to show all-time subscription totals. Step 2 of 2 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: Total subscriptions per version now shows all-time subscription totals from both versions of your demo application. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Well done! You've configured some charts to query real subscription data from New Relic's database. Populate charts with pageView event data Consider the remaining charts that still use mock data: Total unsubscriptions per version Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions Version A - Page views Version B - Page views Past tests Some of these charts need to show page view data. Fortunately, your demo application creates a custom event for every page view like it does for subscriptions! Since Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions require data from two sources, ignore these for now and focus on Version A - Page views and Version B - Page views. Step 1 of 2 In page-views.js, remove the mock data from VersionPageViews and use a NrqlQuery component to supply a query: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 2 of 2 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: In these new queries, you fetch pageView custom events instead of subscription events. You also use a WHERE clause to filter to a particular page_version rather than a FACET to group by page_version. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Phew, that's a lot of queries, but your application looks great! You're now showing real data in four charts. Remember the two charts you ignored because they require data from two sources? Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions You have to handle these differently than you did for the charts you've been dealing with because NRQL has no method for querying data from multiple sources. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to supply data to these two charts. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "Understanding how high cardinality works is important, because it can impact how quickly you reach your data limits. What is cardinality and why does it matter? Cardinality is generally defined as the number of elements in a set. For dimensional metrics, the set in question is the collection of unique maps of attributes observed for a given metric in a one-day period. You can query the cardinality of a metric in New Relic with the following NRQL format: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(metric.name) SINCE today RAW Copy For example, to query the cardinality of the metric memory.heap and find out how many unique key-value pairs exist for this metric, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy Tip We recommend including the RAW clause in cardinality queries that use FROM Metric. This is because in the event your cardinality has been limited, queries like SINCE today will query rollups that are no longer reporting and so need to look at the raw data points to perform the necessary analysis. Note that because querying the raw data points over long time ranges can be slow, RAW queries spanning more than 2 days worth of data are not allowed. While the basics of what cardinality means can be simple to state, learning how to address and manage high cardinality can be a little more complicated. Cardinality limits and enforcement New Relic enforces limits on your metric cardinality both at the per-metric level and at the account level. Cardinality is evaluated over the course of a UTC day, starting at 00:00:00 UTC and ending at 23:59:59 UTC. For more information on data limits and related policies, see New Relic data usage limits and policies Cardinality and dimensional metrics The cardinality of a metric is the size of the set of unique maps of attributes observed for the given metric in a one-day period. If keys or values in that map change over time, they will add new cardinality for that metric. Let's see an example. Imagine a network of 4 hosts, each with 2 containers running on them, and each container periodically reports the gauge metric memory.heap, with the host name and container id added as attributes. When submitted to the Metric API, one of these metrics might look something like this: \"metrics\":[ { \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":5514, \"timestamp\":1234567890, \"attributes\":{ \"host\":\"W\", \"container\":\"1\" } } ] Copy This metric would then have a cardinality of 8, as that's how many unique mappings of host and container are possible. If a new measurement for this metric is taken with identical attributes as one that had previously reported, no new cardinality would be counted. Cardinality influences As shown above, any changes to the keys or values will represent new cardinality, but predicting how those changes will impact your total cardinality can get a little tricky. It's tempting to assume that the cardinality of a metric is then the product of the number of all possible values for each possible key, but this is rarely the case in practice, as the values a given key often depend on or determine the values of other keys. Using the previous example, once we had a container value of 1, the value of host was fixed to W, assuming those container IDs are globally unique. So while there are 8 containers across 4 hosts, the cardinality is still 8, not 4 * 8 = 32, since most combinations counted by the simple multiplication method are not possible and therefore don't contribute to that metric's cardinality. We will never see the combination of host = 'X', container = 1, for instance. This also means that adding more keys to an attributes map does not necessarily imply an increase to total cardinality. If the value of the new key is uniquely determined by the values of existing keys, it will not add new cardinality in the long term. For instance if you add something like region to your map in the example, it's likely the case that the container value is also fixed to a particular region value, and therefore keeps your cardinality at 8. An important caveat here is that while adding region won't increase the cardinality going forward, it will introduce new cardinality when it is first added. This is because adding keys will make those attribute maps distinct from any that came before them, temporarily increasing the total cardinality for that day. Examples and sample workflows If you hit one of your cardinality limits, there are a couple of options you can use to remedy the situation. One easy answer is increasing your limits, but if you would prefer not to do that, a good alternative is to explore which dimensions are contributing the most to your cardinality and think about removing them if they do not provide value. This can save storage and bandwidth costs and potentially prevent you needing to raise your limits. Find cardinality contributors: metrics Recall how to get the cardinality of a particular metric: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy For the total account cardinality, you can use the same basic query structure and simply omit the metric name: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW Copy The account's cardinality is essentially the sum of each metric's cardinality, so adding in a simple FACET query can help find the highest cardinality metrics: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW FACET metricName Copy Finally, if you believe you have hit one of your cardinality limits, you can confirm this by checking for a related NrIntegrationError: FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT count(*) where name = 'CardinalityViolationException' and newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet cardinalityLimitType, metricName, message since today Copy Finding cardinality contributors: dimensions Once you've determined a metric you want to explore, the next step is to determine which dimensions in a given metric contribute the most to its cardinality. If you are unfamiliar with the values of your dimensions, you can look at them like so: FROM Metric SELECT dimensions() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy The JSON results view will likely be advisable here. Looking through these could reveal some dimensions containing a unique ID or other highly variable value that might be worth removing. If you are already familiar with what values your attributes can take on, the keySet() results may be easier to scan: FROM Metric SELECT keySet() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy Understanding the dimensions that have the most influence on your total cardinality comes down to understanding how each key's values correlate with one another. You can experiment with what your cardinality would be without a dimension simply by adding it to the exclude list: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, exclude: {'container.id'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Likewise, there is an include list if that is more convenient to the query context: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, include: {'host.name', 'region'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Managing cardinality can be tricky to conceptualize, but the above methods will help you get answers to questions like \"What metric is contributing the most cardinality?\" and \"What impact does a given attribute(s) have to that total cardinality?\". It's often the case that cardinality tracks with the most unique value, as that value may pin down the possible values other attributes can take on. However, there are plenty of cases where the explosion of possible combinations of a handful of attributes drives the total cardinality. Things that look like unique identifiers are generally a good place to start, but sometimes it's no single key but the combination of two or more keys. The more familiar you are with your data and the systems that generate it, the easier it will be to know which attributes to include or exclude. Tip If you'd like to learn more about limits and troubleshooting the Metric API, here are two good resources: Metric API limits and restricted attributes Troubleshoot Metric API with NRIntegrationError events are both great resources to explore.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize NRQL data, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { this[index] = { endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, } }, data ) historicalData.data = data return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data, format it according to the TableChart specifications, and set it on historicalData.data. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add a section to end your test, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you created a section of your application that allows you to pick the most effective design from your A/B test. The goal of this section is to end the test once you’ve selected a winner: When you select a version from this form, the selection does not persist in the Select component. Now, it’s time to implement that behavior. Step 1 of 11 Change to the persist-selected-version/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/persist-selected-version/ab-test Step 2 of 11 In end-test.js, initialize EndTestSection.state with a default selectedVersion field: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 3 of 11 Pass the selectedVersion, as a prop, to VersionSelector: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 4 of 11 Supply the selectedVersion to your Select component in VersionSelector: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 5 of 11 Create a method, selectVersion(), that updates EndTestSection.state: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy You must bind selectVersion to the EndTestSection component so it can access state. Step 6 of 11 Pass the method to VersionSelector as a prop: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 7 of 11 Set selectVersion as the onChange callback in VersionSelector: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 8 of 11 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/persist-selected-version/ab-test. Step 9 of 11 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 10 of 11 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 11 of 11 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Present an end test confirmation modal, before starting this one. In this series, you're building a full-fledged New Relic One application that ingests data from a demo service that's running an A/B test. The app shows the A/B test data in interesting ways so that you'll ultimately be able to choose whether Version A or Version B is more effective at accomplishing your business goal: to increase high-quality newsletter subscriptions. In past tutorials, you created charts to visualize your data, and you organized those charts so you can use and understand them. You also created a form in your app for ending your test once you're confident in the most effective version. Until now, though, you can't gauge which version is more effective because your charts have been showing mock data, such as: const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } Copy A chart's data prop is useful for supplying manually-crafted data like this or even reformatted third-party data. But for many of your charts, you want to show real-time New Relic data. For example, Newsletter subscriptions by version should show subscription data, which exists in New Relic's database, NRDB for short. To query NRDB, you first need to know what data you're looking for. Remember your demo backend service? Well, that service reports a subscription event to New Relic when a user subscribes to a newsletter from your site. You can view these subscription events in New Relic while your demo services are running. View Subscription Events in New Relic Before you query NRDB from your charts, experiment with querying data from New Relic's web interface. Step 1 of 3 From your New Relic homepage, go to to the Data explorer from the top navigation menu: Data explorer lets you explore your telemetry data: metrics events logs traces Since the backend submits newsletter subscriptions as events to New Relic, you can see them in this view. Step 2 of 3 Select subscription from the Custom events menu: This queries NRDB for subscription event totals per minute over the last 30 minutes and shows that data in a chart: Step 3 of 3 Click Dimensions to see a list of the attributes associated with these subscription events: You can filter and group subscription events using these dimensions. Notice the NRQL query above the chart. This shows the chart's underlying query, which is based on these dimensions. Click the page-version dimension to see the query change to group by FACET page_version: The Data explorer presents two options for filtering and sorting your data: User interface (UI) selections like the one you've just made New Relic Query Language (NRQL) The UI is useful for quickly filtering data, and it doesn't require you to know NRQL. For your New Relic One application, however, you need to use NRQL queries. Click the NRQL query to navigate to the Query builder: Here, you can view and manually edit the query to fetch the data you need. Update NewsletterSignups with a NrqlQuery Before you begin integrating New Relic data in your NR1 app, consult your design guide: Your New Relic One application has eight charts in total, including line charts, pie charts, and table charts. Each of these charts currently shows mock data, but they need to show real data to be useful. First, focus on querying data for the topmost chart: Newsletter subscriptions per version. With the query you've built in the Data explorer, you already have the data you need for this chart: Technical detail In your query, you fetch subscription totals (SELECT count(*) FROM subscriptions), group them by their page version (FACET page_version), and focus the timeseries to the past 30 minutes (SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES). Explore our documentation to learn more about NRQL queries. Next, you learn how to pass your NRQL query to your Newsletter subscriptions per version chart. Step 1 of 7 Change to the add-nrql-components/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nrql-components/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, update the LineChart in NewsletterSignups. Remove the mock data, and use the NRQL query you built in the Data explorer: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. In NrqlQuery, you set two props: accountId: The id for the account you query from query: The query to perform With these, your NR1 app can query the data you want to show in your chart. Tip There is a convenience prop for using NRQL to supply data to your charts, called query. If you'd rather not use the NrqlQuery component, try the query prop instead: <LineChart accountId={<YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID>} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" /> Copy Keep in mind you must still supply the accountId. Step 3 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nrql-components/ab-test. Step 4 of 7 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 7 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 7 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: Newsletter subscriptions by version now shows real data from New Relic's database rather than the mock data you defined before. Notice that your chart pulls data when your application loads, but does not continue pulling data while the application is open. You can fix this by adding another prop. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 7 of 7 Add a pollInterval: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. The pollInterval is the number of milliseconds between chart refreshes. Each time the chart refreshes, it queries fresh data from New Relic. In this case, you refresh every minute. Populate your PieChart with subscription event data Now that you've seen how to passed New Relic data to Newsletter subscriptions per version, it's time to move on to Total subscriptions per version. These two charts are similar in that they compare subscription event data grouped by version. The primary differences between Newsletter subscriptions per version and Total subscriptions per version are: One is a line chart and one is a pie chart One shows timeseries data and one shows all-time totals Step 1 of 2 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js, update the TestDistributions component, removing the mock data and populating the PieChart with the same NRQL query you used for Newsletter subscriptions per version but with different TIMESERIES and SINCE clauses: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, PieChart, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 7 DAYS AGO\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <PieChart data={data} fullWidth /> } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. You don't need the TIMESERIES clause because the pie chart only shows numerical data. You don't need the SINCE clause because Total subscriptions per version needs to show all-time subscription totals. Step 2 of 2 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: Total subscriptions per version now shows all-time subscription totals from both versions of your demo application. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Well done! You've configured some charts to query real subscription data from New Relic's database. Populate charts with pageView event data Consider the remaining charts that still use mock data: Total unsubscriptions per version Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions Version A - Page views Version B - Page views Past tests Some of these charts need to show page view data. Fortunately, your demo application creates a custom event for every page view like it does for subscriptions! Since Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions require data from two sources, ignore these for now and focus on Version A - Page views and Version B - Page views. Step 1 of 2 In page-views.js, remove the mock data from VersionPageViews and use a NrqlQuery component to supply a query: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 2 of 2 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: In these new queries, you fetch pageView custom events instead of subscription events. You also use a WHERE clause to filter to a particular page_version rather than a FACET to group by page_version. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Phew, that's a lot of queries, but your application looks great! You're now showing real data in four charts. Remember the two charts you ignored because they require data from two sources? Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions You have to handle these differently than you did for the charts you've been dealing with because NRQL has no method for querying data from multiple sources. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to supply data to these two charts. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor API name: SCRIPT_API Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert modal Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Enter a secure credential Hover over an element Locate an element by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, Xpath, or value Navigate to a URL Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize NRQL data, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { this[index] = { endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, } }, data ) historicalData.data = data return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data, format it according to the TableChart specifications, and set it on historicalData.data. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet.",

Before you build your New Relic One application, you need to spin up your demo services. This coursework depends on two important services: A web service that shows a newsletter signup form. The form's heading text alternates between two versions because you're performing an A/B test to determine which text leads to more high-quality subscriptions. A simulator service that sends steady traffic to the website so that you don't have to manually generate data To spin up your demo services, you first need to install Docker and Docker compose. Spin up your demo services Step 1 of 5 Clone the coursework repository from GitHub: bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course This repository contains code for creating NodeJS New Relic automations. It also contains a an app code directory for each lesson in the course. You'll use these directories to follow along with the course content. Step 2 of 5 Change to the demo directory, called ab-test-app: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/ab-test-app This directory contains configuration files and READMEs for using the demo. Step 3 of 5 Build and run the web service and simulator containers, using docker-compose: bash Copy $ NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=<your New Relic license key> docker-compose up -d Important Make sure you replace <your New Relic license key> with your actual license key. Once it's finished, view the website at localhost:3001: Step 4 of 5 Visit New Relic, and navigate to APM in the top navigation menu. Select Newsletter from the list of instrumented services: You may have to wait a minute or two for New Relic to recieve data from your demo services. Once it's ready, you'll see transaction data, such as performance, throughput, and an Apdex score: Step 5 of 5 To spin down your demo services, run docker-compose down from your ab-test-app directory: bash Copy $ docker-compose down Now you're ready to build your New Relic One application!

Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install and configure the New Relic One CLI Create a Nerdpack Step 1 of 5 Update your CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 5 Create a Nerdpack with the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name entity-nerdlet This results in a Nerdpack, called entity-nerdlet, which consists of a launcher, called entity-nerdlet-launcher, and a Nerdlet, called entity-nerdlet-nerdlet. Step 3 of 5 Serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ cd entity-nerdlet $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 4 of 5 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and navigate to Apps: ?nerdpacks=local is required to enable your locally served Nerdpacks to load in New Relic. Step 5 of 5 Under Your apps, click your launcher to view your New Relic One application: Attach your Nerdlet to entities You've seen how you can access your Nerdlet from a launcher. Now, access your Nerdlet from your entities. Step 1 of 6 From inside your Nerdpack's root directory, open nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json. This is your Nerdlet's metadata file. You'll use this file to attach your Nerdlet to entities. Step 2 of 6 Add a context object with an entities array: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [] 8 } 9 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy This tells New Relic that you want to surface your Nerdlet in an array of entity contexts. Step 3 of 6 Add an entity context: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [ 8 { 9 \"domain\": \"APM\", 10 \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" 11 } 12 ] 13 } 14 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Here, you've attached your Nerdlet to all application entities in the APM domain. Step 4 of 6 Go to APM: Because you're serving your Nerdpack locally, remember that you must still specify the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 5 of 6 Choose any of your applications: Step 6 of 6 Scroll down to see your Nerdlet attached to the application: Click this menu option and see your Nerdlet the same way you did with the launcher. Configure your entities context The context.entities key in your Nerdlet's nr1.json file specifies which entities your Nerdlet should be attached to. Specify an entity domain Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity domain by specifying the domain as one of the following values: APM: Application Performance Monitoring BROWSER: Browser INFRA: Infrastructure monitoring MOBILE: Mobile monitoring SYNTH: Synthetic monitoring For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities in the APM domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those in a domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"!APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities in multiple domains: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" }] } } Copy Specify an entity type Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity type by specifying the type as one of the following values: APPLICATION HOST MONITOR For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities of the APPLICATION type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those of a specified type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"!APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity whose type matches one of an array of types: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }, { \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }] } } Copy Specify entity tags Attach your Nerdlet to entities that have a given tag. For example, attach your Nerdlet to the entity which has a particular GUID: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"guid\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ENTITY GUID>\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity which has particular accountId and uses the Python programming language: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"accountId\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ACCOUNT ID>\"] }, { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Combine filters When you filter the entities to which your Nerdlet will be added, you can combine domain, type, and tags: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"domain\": \"APM\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\", \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] }, { \"domain\": \"SYNTH\", \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" } ] } } Copy In this example, you've attached your Nerdlet to: All APM applications whose metadata tags specify the python language AND all Synthetic monitors AND all Browser entities",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Install and configure the New Relic One CLI, before starting this one. A Nerdpack is a package that contains all the files that make up a New Relic One application or visualization. Nerdpacks include files for metadata, Nerdlets, assets, and more. To create a Nerdpack, use the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack When nr1 prompts for a component name, use \"ab-test\" and watch the tool create the foundations of your Nerdpack. Once it's finished, explore the files it created for you. Root directory At the root level, you have a directory called ab-test. Everything inside this directory is part of the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls ab-test README.md nerdlets nr1.json package.json launchers node_modules package-lock.json Readme.md provides instructions for creating Nerdpack elements and serving your application locally. This and nr1 --help are useful if you forget how to interact with your Nerdpack using the command line tool. Javascript files package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules are important for running your JavaScript application, but aren't unique to Nerdpacks. You can learn about these modules from JavaScript courses should you need to tweak them. For now, take a look at nr1.json, one of the most relevant files in this directory. Metadata file nr1.json is the Nerdpack's metadata file, containing a schema type, unique identifier, a display name, and a description. Since you’re building a New Relic One application for running and analyzing A/B tests, update the package's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and set the description to \"A/B test your application using New Relic One\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"311bcd0c-f7eb-4285-afed-4219179bf91d\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"A/B test your application using New Relic One.\" } nr1.json Copy It's good to describe your application's purpose, especially if you're going to publish your application for others to use. Next, look at the launchers and nerdlets subdirectories. Launchers launchers is a directory because you can create multiple launchers for your New Relic One application. nr1 create only created one launcher for your Nerdpack and called it \"ab-test-launcher\". Inside its directory, there are two files: icon.png is an image that represents the application nr1.json is the launcher's metadata file Use \"A/B Test Launcher\" for the launcher's displayName and \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\" for the description in nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"ab-test-launcher\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test Launcher\", \"description\": \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\" } launchers/ab-test-launcher/nr1.json Copy Notice that the launcher has a rootNerdletId. This identifies the Nerdlet that the launcher opens when it's selected. This Nerdpack has only one Nerdlet, called ab-test-nerdlet, but some Nerdpacks may have multiple. Make sure that you set the rootNerdletId to the Nerdlet you want the launcher to open. Nerdlets The nerdlets directory contains all the Nerdlets that make up your New Relic One application. Since ab-test-nerdlet is the only Nerdlet in this Nerdpack, there is only one subdirectory. In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, there are three files: index.js is the JavaScript file that contains your Nerdlet component styles.scss holds the Sass stylesheet for your Nerdlet nr1.json contains the Nerdlet's metadata Update your Nerdlet's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and description to \"Control and view results of your A/B test\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"Control and view results of your A/B test\" } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Now, you've customized your Nerdpack, Nerdlet, and launcher with informative display names and descriptions, but what does your application actually do? Check out index.js to see what your default Nerdlet looks like: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, ab-test-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you have AbTestNerdletNerdlet, which nr1 created for you. It's a React component that renders a first-level welcome heading. Because this is the root Nerdlet, as specified in your launcher's nr1.json file, when you click on your launcher in the New Relic platform, the launcher will open a view that displays this heading. Tip In this lesson, you used nr1 create to create a Nerdpack, complete with a launcher and a Nerdlet. If you want to create another Nerdlet or Launcher in your Nerdpack, you can also do that with nr1 create: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdlet $ nr1 create --type launcher You can even skip the --type flag and select an option from a list: bash Copy $ nr1 create ? What kind of component do you want to create? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit. nerdpack ❯ nerdlet - create a/an Nerdlet Nerdpack item inside your Nerdpack. launcher catalog visualization In the next lesson, you'll learn how to serve your Nerdpack locally and see your app in action!

Quickly understand context We provide multiple ways to understand your system's dependencies, so you can easily see how everything fits together and troubleshoot problems. New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity! If you want to... Use this Have an overall view of your system, and drill down to get performance details. Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the entities (that is, all applications, services, hosts, or containers) in your system. Gain extensive visibility into each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected. Use the New Relic Navigator to give you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And use the New Relic Lookout to spot entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Provide context for your entities. Add tags to all your entities. Or create tags for teams and all the services they monitor. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. See how each part of your system is connected. Service maps illustrate your upstream and downstream dependencies. Visualize the aggregated health and activity data from all you monitor. Group and monitor any entities together into functional team-focused, project-focused groupings, or any other attribute, with workloads. Fetch and analyze specific data. Get more context while you query with the query builder, which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Find a service or dashboard in a complex environment. Search by name across all accounts in the unified search, or filter the explorer by tags or text. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. View a list of all the dependencies for a service. The dependencies view tab in an entity summary shows all the dependencies of the entity you’re viewing. Track activity as it moves across your distributed system. Distributed tracing helps you analyze your modern environment. Understand how everything is connected via API. The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer manages all your entities, tags, and relationships. Query your data more easily On the Browse data menu on the top navigation menu you can easily access your basic telemetry data (metrics, events, logs, and traces). Wherever you go in the UI, Query your data is available. No matter your level of proficiency with our query language, you can create custom queries and charts: Browse your data in a query-less experience with our data explorer. Use your NRQL (our query language) expertise to build custom charts in the query builder. Run PromQL-style queries in the query builder. one.newrelic.com > Query your data: Build NRQL and PROMQL-like queries. Enhanced dashboards one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Quickly create information dense custom views into the data that matters most to you with dashboards in New Relic One. New Relic One dashboards let you build better visualizations more easily, with more options to customize. Dashboard features include: Perform NRQL queries and create charts and dashboards everywhere in the platform using the query builder. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add chart headings, before starting this one. With your charts organized and descriptive headings above each one, your New Relic One application is becoming more usable. In this lesson, you'll continue that trend by creating descriptions for each design version in your A/B test. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-version-descriptions/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-version-descriptions/ab-test Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named description.js: bash Copy $ touch description.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a new React component, called VersionDescription, which uses a HeadingText and a BlockText to render a version description that you pass, using the description prop: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, HeadingText } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionDescription extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return ( <div> <HeadingText className=\"versionHeader\"> Version {this.props.version} </HeadingText> <BlockText className=\"versionText\"> {this.props.description} </BlockText> </div> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/description.js Copy You'll use this one class to create a version description for each design version in your A/B test. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import VersionDescription, create descriptions for each design version, and create a new GridItem component for each design version: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you've created two VersionDescription components. You passed the description and version props, which correspond to a design version. You also added a horizontal rule to visually separate the descriptions from the charts in your app. For this, you added a GridItem with a columnSpan of 12, to stretch the rule the full width of the grid. Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-version-descriptions/ab-test. Step 6 of 8 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 7 of 8 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now, you've added descriptions for your competing designs and your charts. In the next lesson, you’ll create a new section of your application from user interface components.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add a section to end your test, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you created a section of your application that allows you to pick the most effective design from your A/B test. The goal of this section is to end the test once you’ve selected a winner: When you select a version from this form, the selection does not persist in the Select component. Now, it’s time to implement that behavior. Step 1 of 11 Change to the persist-selected-version/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/persist-selected-version/ab-test Step 2 of 11 In end-test.js, initialize EndTestSection.state with a default selectedVersion field: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 3 of 11 Pass the selectedVersion, as a prop, to VersionSelector: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 4 of 11 Supply the selectedVersion to your Select component in VersionSelector: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 5 of 11 Create a method, selectVersion(), that updates EndTestSection.state: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy You must bind selectVersion to the EndTestSection component so it can access state. Step 6 of 11 Pass the method to VersionSelector as a prop: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 7 of 11 Set selectVersion as the onChange callback in VersionSelector: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 8 of 11 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/persist-selected-version/ab-test. Step 9 of 11 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 10 of 11 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 11 of 11 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Voila! When you select a new version as the winner of the A/B test, that version is reflected in the menu. However, when you press End test, nothing happens. In the next lesson, you'll create a confirmation dialog to protect yourself from prematurely ending your A/B test.

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

Once your metrics are in New Relic, you can query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Want to try out our StatsD integration? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements This integration uses our Metric API and our Event API to ingest data. To use these APIs, you'll need a license key. The integration adheres to the Metric API requirements and data limits. The default rate limit is 100,000 data points per minute (DPM). If you think you're missing metrics or sending more than 100K DPM, see Request data changes. To see if your account is hitting the rate limit, run the following NRQL query of the NrIntegrationError event: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' FACET category, message LIMIT 100 since 1 day ago Copy Install This section will explain how to do a standard install. If you want to run StatsD in Kubernetes, see Kubernetes install. To install the StatsD integration, run the following command and include your New Relic account ID and New Relic license key. This generates a TOML configuration file used by gostatsd. docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy If your account is in the EU data center region, add this to the above command: -e NR_EU_REGION=true \\ Copy After installing, you can: Do optional additional configuration Define your metrics Add custom tags to your data Create alerts Install for Kubernetes Here are examples of Kubernetes manifests for deployment and service objects: Kubernetes manifest examples Below are examples of Kubernetes manifests to deploy StatsD in a Kubernetes environment and create a StatsD service named newrelic-statsd.

Configure In the install procedure, you run nri-statsd with environment variables, and this generates a TOML configuration file. Additionally, you can set these configuration options: Configuration options Description expiry-interval string If a metric is not updated for this amount of time, we stop reporting that metric. Default is 5m. If you want to send the metrics only if the value was updated between the flush intervals, configure this to 1ms. To never expire metrics, set it to 0. percent-threshold list of integers Specifies the percentiles used for metrics aggregation. Default: 90. metrics-addr string Indicates address on which to listen for metrics. Default: :8125. Tip To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the StatsD integration you must define the following endpoints in the custom configuration: address = 'https://gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/ $NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' Copy address-metrics = 'https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' Copy Here are some examples of customizing configuration by overwriting the default configuration: Example of custom configuration # Specify after how long do we expire metrics, default:5m expiry-interval = '1ms' # percent-threshold specify a list of percentiles for metrics aggregation, default:90 percent-threshold = [90, 99] backends='newrelic' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY' Copy Disable timer sub-metrics: By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. If you want to disable those metrics you can do it by adding a disabled-sub-metrics configuration section and set true for the ones you want disabled. Here's an example: # disabled-sub-metrics configuration section allows disabling timer sub-metrics [disabled-sub-metrics] # Regular metrics count=false count-per-second=false mean=false median=false lower=false upper=false stddev=false sum=false sum-squares=false # Percentile metrics count-pct=false mean-pct=false sum-pct=false sum-squares-pct=false lower-pct=false upper-pct=false Copy Docker: overwrite default configuration To overwrite the default nri-statsd configuration while running in a container, you can mount a configuration file inside the container. You can adopt the following template as needed for your situation. Example: backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY' Copy To run the container with the file mounted in the appropriate path: docker run \\ ... -v ${PWD}/nri-statsd.toml:/etc/opt/newrelic/nri-statsd.toml \\ ... newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Kubernetes: overwrite default configuration The best approach to configure nri-statsd running in Kubernetes is to use a configMap and mount the configMap into the container. (This is a similar process to mounting the configuration file in Docker.) Example: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-statsd-config namespace: default data: nri-statsd.toml: | backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = '$NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY' Copy To use the configMap, declare a volume on your deployment spec template and then declare a volumeMount on your container spec. Example: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment spec: template: spec: containers: .... volumeMounts: - mountPath: /etc/opt/newrelic/ name: nri-statsd-config volumes: - name: nri-statsd-config configMap: name: nri-statsd-config Copy Metric format The integration receives metrics using the StatsD protocol. Optionally, the sample rate can be configured and tags can be added. Here's the metric data format we use: <metric name>:<value>|<type>|@<sample rate>|#<tags> Copy Here are explanations of these fields: Field name Description < metric name> string Required. Name of the metric. < value> string Required. The metric type: c = counter g = gauge ms = timer @ < sample rate> float Optional for simple counters or timer counters. When many metrics must be sent, you can use sampling to reduce network traffic. The downside is a reduction in the resolution of the data. An example of how this would work for sample rates below 1: If you set this to 0.1, the counter would send a measurement one out of every 10 times. # < tags> string Optional. Tags attached to your metrics are converted into attributes (key-value pairs). For more on tagging options, see Tags. Metric types Here are the types of metrics and how to format them: Counter A counter measures the number of occurrences of an event. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. A counter can be incremented or decremented during the same flush interval by adding a sign to the value. In the following example, the counter value will be 2: counter:4|c counter:-2|c Copy At each flush, the current count is sent and reset to 0. If the count is not updated, at the next flush it will send the value 0. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Here’s an example of a counter that is being sampled 1 out of 10 times: counter:4|c@0.1 Copy Gauge A gauge represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include temperature, CPU usage, and memory. Here's an example: temperature:40|g Copy If the gauge is not updated, at the next flush it will send the previous value. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Timer The timer metric type measures timing data. By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. These are sent as sub-metrics in the following format: <metric_base_name>.std_dev <metric_base_name>.median <metric_base_name>.summary <metric_base_name>.sum_squares <metric_base_name>.mean <metric_base_name>.per_second Copy The configured percentiles will generate the following metrics. The percentile threshold value will be attached as a tag. <metric_base_name>.sum_squares.percentiles <metric_base_name>.sum.percentiles <metric_base_name>.count.percentiles <metric_base_name>.upper.percentiles <metric_base_name>.mean.percentiles Copy The percentile threshold can be tweaked with the percent-threshold config option. These can be controlled through the disabled-sub-metrics configuration section. Add tags (attributes) You can add tags to your data, which we save as attributes (key-value pairs). There are two options for adding tags: Add default tags that apply to all metrics: These apply to all metrics. They are fixed and don't change over time. Add metric-level tags: These apply to specific metrics and allow the value to be changed between two submits. Add default tags that apply to all metrics Add tags to metrics and events by defining an environment variable in the startup command. Here's an example that would create two tags: -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" Copy Here's that environment variable used in the startup command: docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Add metric-level tags When defining the metric format, you can add tags using this format: <bucket name>:<value>|<type>|#<tags> Copy In this example, <tags> is a comma-separated list of tags. Tags format is: simple or key:value. Here's an example NRQL query that includes a custom tag: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE environment = 'production' Copy Create alerts You can alert on StatsD data using NRQL alert conditions. Alert example This procedure walks you through sending some sample data and then creating an alert condition using that data. First, send this data to New Relic’s StatsD container: echo \"prod.test.num:32|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Next, create a NRQL alert condition using this query: SELECT latest(prod.test.num) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'prod.test.num' Copy Here's an image showing creating this NRQL alert condition. Notice that the sample data sent in is represented by the blue dot on the upper right of the chart. Now we can create the alert condition with these settings: When you create the NRQL alert condition, be sure to set the Condition name. If a metric with a value above 50 is sent, then an incident is created and notified. The incident is closed automatically after 24 hours. To test that the alert is working, run this command: echo \"prod.test.num:60|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Find and use data To query your data, you'd use any New Relic query option. For example, you might run a NRQL query like: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'myMetric' and environment = 'production' Copy For more on how to query the Metric data type, see Query metric data.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add your first chart, before starting this one. You’ve begun building your A/B test application. So far, it consists of a single line chart, which represents the number of subscriptions your newsletter receives from each version of your website. To understand what you’ll build in this lesson, review the design guide to remember what charts come next: In the design, there are two pie charts beneath the line chart that you’ve already created. One represents the distribution of users who receive version A and version B. The other represents the distribution of successful requests from users who got version A and version B. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-pie-charts/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add two new Javascript files: total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js bash Copy $ touch total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js Step 3 of 9 In total-subscriptions.js, create a component, called TotalSubscriptions, which renders mocked subscription data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Notice that the series data is formatted differently for PieChart than it was for LineChart. Because PieChart uses unidimensional data, its series only take y-values. Step 4 of 9 In total-cancellations.js, create a component, called TotalCancellations, which renders mocked cancellation data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new components and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the PieChart components displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Your application is starting to take shape. You’ve created a line chart and two pie charts. For now, these charts use mocked data, but you’ll provide them real data in a later lesson. Before you focus on the data in your charts, however, you’ll learn how to add a table to your application so you can visualize data in a new way.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add tables, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you added a variety of charts to your A/B test application. These charts presented different facets of information about your A/B test, and they behaved independently from one other. In this lesson, you’ll create a new pair of line charts and learn how to synchronize their behaviors. Before you write any new code, consult your design guide to understand the role that these new charts will play in your application: In the design guide, there is a line graph under each of the tables you created in the last lesson. These line graphs show the version-specific response times for newsletter signup requests. Now, you’ll build two more line charts, but this time, you’ll group them with a ChartGroup and specify that their values are measured in milliseconds. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-a-chart-group/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named page-views.js: bash Copy $ touch page-views.js Step 3 of 9 In this new file, create a component called VersionPageViews to hold a LineChart, which shows the number of times a page is viewed: import React from 'react'; import { LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Notice the new attribute in the series' metadata fields: units_data. This attribute describes the unit type for a specified data axis. In this case, you set the unit type for the y axis to 'MS', which stands for milliseconds. Other options for unit types, include: 'PERCENTAGE', 'TIMESTAMP', and 'BYTES_PER_SECOND'. Step 4 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In index.js, import ChartGroup from nr1 and group your VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <ChartGroup> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </ChartGroup> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Because the tables are conceptually related, as they show contrasting performance metrics over the same timeslice, it makes sense to group them in a ChartGroup. This means that the two charts behave synchronously. For example, when you hover over one chart, the other chart shows a hover indicator at the same x coordinate. Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the LineChart components synchronized in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Tip Each of the chart component types you've used in this lesson have had different series configurations. Most chart components share the same metadata attributes, like LineChart and PieChart, but differ in their data formats. It's helpful to be aware of the different data formats, for when you create your own charts. You can read more about the data formats in the chart component documentation. Now your application is filled with charts, but it doesn't look great. The charts are stacked on top of one another in an unhelpful way. In the next lesson, you'll learn about the user interface components from the SDK and how you can use them to organize your charts.

Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account and Node.js installed on your machine. See Setting up your development environment for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git $ cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application. Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID $ npm install # Install dependencies $ nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, you should see a Create a table launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet subdirectory and open the index.js file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component. Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows. As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells. The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done!

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. Quick start Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Tip In case you want to enable REMOTE_MONITORING, you need to change your localhost when granting permisions by the server from where you want to monitor the MySQL instance. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the MysqlSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The MySQL integration collects the following metrics: Default metrics These metrics are captured by default: Name Description cluster.slaveRunning Boolean. 1 if this server is a replication slave that is connected to a replication master, and both the I/O and SQL threads are running; otherwise, it is 0.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add navigation to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you finished the A/B test application you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to prepare it for publication. When you publish your app to the New Relic One catalog, users can view it and subscribe to it. You can help your users by showing and telling them what the app does, how to use it, and more. Create catalog information To supply information to the catalog about your app, you need to create the catalog directory in your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 6 Change to the describe-app/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test Step 2 of 6 Create the catalog directories: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog This creates a root catalog directory with template files for inputting custom information about your app and a catalog directory for each Nerdpack item where screenshots can be stored. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog directory. Step 3 of 6 Update catalog/documentation.md: ## Documentation This application combines and presents data from New Relic and the Nerdsletter API so that we can make an informed decision on which design version results in more high-quality newsletter subscriptions. It also presents an button to end the test, which saves the date and version descriptions in local storage. We can use this app for future A/B tests as well! catalog/documentation.md Copy For this course, you're keeping the documentation concise by merely describing what the app does. In your own projects, you might also include instructions for contributing to the project in an open source context, installing the app's dependencies, or anything else that might help a user navigate complexities in your app or code. Step 4 of 6 Update catalog/config.json: { \"tagline\": \"Win @ newsletter subscriptions\", \"details\": \"Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course\", \"whatsNew\": \"Initial release! Includes:\\n- A variety of charts for understanding the test results\\n- An end test button for storing some test data in a table\", \"support\": { \"email\": { \"address\": \"\" }, \"issues\": { \"url\": \"\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"\" } } } catalog/config.json Copy Here, you've specified a tagline, project details, the source code repository, and a short list of everything included in the initial release. In other projects, you might also add a support email or support links. Step 5 of 6 Save this screenshot to your catalog/screenshots directory. Users will be able to see a carousel of screenshots in your app's About page in the catalog. Step 6 of 6 Save the following icon as icon.png in two places: nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test/launchers/ab-test-launcher This will act as the launcher's icon and the app's catalog icon on the About page. Now you've added documentation, screenshots, metadata, and an icon to your app so that users will be able to understand what it does and why they might need it. For now, these files are all local and they need to be submitted to the catalog. But before you can do that, your app, itself, needs to be published to the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll publish your app, submit your catalog information, and view the results in New Relic.

New Relic One gives you and your teams a connected view that cuts through complexity! If you want to... Use this Have an overall view of your system, and drill down to get performance details. Use the New Relic Explorer as the front door to New Relic One: observe, group, and filter the performance data from all the entities (that is, all applications, services, hosts, or containers) in your system. Gain extensive visibility into each entity in your solution, its alert status, and how the entities are connected. Use the New Relic Navigator to give you a high density overview of all your entities so you can detect any issues at a glance. And use the New Relic Lookout to spot entities recently experiencing behavior deviations. Provide context for your entities. Add tags to all your entities. Or create tags for teams and all the services they monitor. Use tags to illustrate relationships and contextual information for what you monitor. By thoughtfully tagging your entities, you can connect all the data your teams need to understand their increasingly complex and interdependent systems. See how each part of your system is connected. Service maps illustrate your upstream and downstream dependencies. Visualize the aggregated health and activity data from all you monitor. Group and monitor any entities together into functional team-focused, project-focused groupings, or any other attribute, with workloads. Fetch and analyze specific data. Get more context while you query with the query builder, which surfaces data definitions as you craft and edit queries. Create visuals that showcase your business needs at a glance. Tailor custom dashboards for your unique needs. Find a service or dashboard in a complex environment. Search by name across all accounts in the unified search, or filter the explorer by tags or text. View everything you’re monitoring in one place, like entities or dashboards across your organization. View a list of all the dependencies for a service. The dependencies view tab in an entity summary shows all the dependencies of the entity you’re viewing. Track activity as it moves across your distributed system. Distributed tracing helps you analyze your modern environment. Understand how everything is connected via API. The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer manages all your entities, tags, and relationships.

Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Incident Intelligence events One billing factor is how many incident events your organization sends to Incident Intelligence for correlation and analysis. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, Incident Intelligence comes with a certain number of free incident events per month. (Our original pricing plan doesn't have a free tier.) You can track usage and cost in two places in the UI: In the usage UI From the Incident Intelligence system settings UI page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, then click Incident Intelligence, and then click System settings. Determine event source When you set up Incident Intelligence data sources, the incident events ingested by those sources are what count towards your total. To see the sources affecting your billing, go to the Sources page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, click Incident Intelligence, and then click Sources. Stop reporting events Go to the Incident Intelligence Sources UI page and disconnect all the sources you don’t want. If all sources are removed, no data is sent to Incident Intelligence. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the Instant Observability catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info AbTest (Nerdpack): description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

Step 3 of 3 View your app in Instant Observability: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability.

Step 2 of 10 In newsletter-signups.js, create a new method, called NewsletterSignups.openApmEntity(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. This method uses navigation.openStackedEntity() to display your demo application's APM entity in a stacked view. Notice openApmEntity() requires your ENTITY_GUID. You need to locate that ID and store it in a constant. Step 3 of 10 Navigate to APM: See metadata for your Newsletter service: Copy the entity's GUID: Create an ENTITY_GUID constant: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and the entity GUID you just copied, respectively. Now, openApmEntity() knows what entity to show. Next, you need to create a button to invoke this method. Step 4 of 10 Create a button to show your APM entity: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you've created a button and configured it to call openApmEntity() when it's clicked. Step 5 of 10 Import Stack and StackItem: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. You'll use Stack and StackItem to lay out the button on the far right side of the same row that the HeadingText is on. Step 6 of 10 Lay out the Stack: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <Stack fullWidth> <StackItem grow={true}> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> </StackItem> <StackItem> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> </StackItem> </Stack> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you used a full-width Stack to set up the layout for the row. To make the HeadingText fill the entire row except the width of the button, you used the StackItem.grow prop. Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. Click App performance: Now you see the stacked entity: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively Congratulations! You're finished writing all the code you'll write for your New Relic One A/B test application. Now, you have an application reporting New Relic data from your demo service that is running an A/B test. You've created several charts, buttons, and other UI elements. And you've organized your components into a readable and usable view. On top of the visuals, you've supplied data to your charts from multiple data sources in and outside of New Relic. You've created some backend functionality which utilizes your New Relic One application's own data store. You've also utilized the platform APIs for interacting with platform UI and showing a stacked entity view. You've really accomplished a lot throughout this course, so far. There are only a few things left to do! First, is to learn how to publish and subscribe to your New Relic One application so that it can run on our platform instead of your own local server. Second, is to learn how to deal with some common issues you might see in New Relic One application development.

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Incident Intelligence events One billing factor is how many incident events your organization sends to Incident Intelligence for correlation and analysis. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, Incident Intelligence comes with a certain number of free incident events per month. (Our original pricing plan doesn't have a free tier.) You can track usage and cost in two places in the UI: In the usage UI From the Incident Intelligence system settings UI page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, then click Incident Intelligence, and then click System settings. Determine event source When you set up Incident Intelligence data sources, the incident events ingested by those sources are what count towards your total. To see the sources affecting your billing, go to the Sources page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, click Incident Intelligence, and then click Sources. Stop reporting events Go to the Incident Intelligence Sources UI page and disconnect all the sources you don’t want. If all sources are removed, no data is sent to Incident Intelligence. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

The New Relic One application that you're building throughout this course allows developers to A/B test their websites. To run a successful A/B test, site owners need to be able to analyze the results. Without knowing how each design performs, how will developers determine which design to use? Here is a mockup for the A/B test application you're building: Your application displays data for two competing versions. With various charts and tables, your users will be able to analyze the results of their test and make informed decisions on which design will work best to achieve their goals. You’ll refer back to this mockup many times throughout this course. It shows you what charts to create, how to organize them, and what kind of data to provide them. In the next four sections, you learn how to create every chart that your A/B test application needs to operate effectively.

Everything inside this directory is part of the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls ab-test README.md nerdlets nr1.json package.json launchers node_modules package-lock.json Readme.md provides instructions for creating Nerdpack elements and serving your application locally. This and nr1 --help are useful if you forget how to interact with your Nerdpack using the command line tool. Javascript files package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules are important for running your JavaScript application, but aren't unique to Nerdpacks. You can learn about these modules from JavaScript courses should you need to tweak them. For now, take a look at nr1.json, one of the most relevant files in this directory. Metadata file nr1.json is the Nerdpack's metadata file, containing a schema type, unique identifier, a display name, and a description. Since you’re building a New Relic One application for running and analyzing A/B tests, update the package's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and set the description to \"A/B test your application using New Relic One\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"311bcd0c-f7eb-4285-afed-4219179bf91d\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"A/B test your application using New Relic One.\" } nr1.json Copy It's good to describe your application's purpose, especially if you're going to publish your application for others to use. Next, look at the launchers and nerdlets subdirectories. Launchers launchers is a directory because you can create multiple launchers for your New Relic One application. nr1 create only created one launcher for your Nerdpack and called it \"ab-test-launcher\". Inside its directory, there are two files: icon.png is an image that represents the application nr1.json is the launcher's metadata file Use \"A/B Test Launcher\" for the launcher's displayName and \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\" for the description in nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"ab-test-launcher\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test Launcher\", \"description\": \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\" } launchers/ab-test-launcher/nr1.json Copy Notice that the launcher has a rootNerdletId. This identifies the Nerdlet that the launcher opens when it's selected. This Nerdpack has only one Nerdlet, called ab-test-nerdlet, but some Nerdpacks may have multiple. Make sure that you set the rootNerdletId to the Nerdlet you want the launcher to open. Nerdlets The nerdlets directory contains all the Nerdlets that make up your New Relic One application. Since ab-test-nerdlet is the only Nerdlet in this Nerdpack, there is only one subdirectory. In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, there are three files: index.js is the JavaScript file that contains your Nerdlet component styles.scss holds the Sass stylesheet for your Nerdlet nr1.json contains the Nerdlet's metadata Update your Nerdlet's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and description to \"Control and view results of your A/B test\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"Control and view results of your A/B test\" } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Now, you've customized your Nerdpack, Nerdlet, and launcher with informative display names and descriptions, but what does your application actually do? Check out index.js to see what your default Nerdlet looks like: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, ab-test-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you have AbTestNerdletNerdlet, which nr1 created for you. It's a React component that renders a first-level welcome heading. Because this is the root Nerdlet, as specified in your launcher's nr1.json file, when you click on your launcher in the New Relic platform, the launcher will open a view that displays this heading. Tip In this lesson, you used nr1 create to create a Nerdpack, complete with a launcher and a Nerdlet. If you want to create another Nerdlet or Launcher in your Nerdpack, you can also do that with nr1 create: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdlet $ nr1 create --type launcher You can even skip the --type flag and select an option from a list: bash Copy $ nr1 create ?

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Incident Intelligence events One billing factor is how many incident events your organization sends to Incident Intelligence for correlation and analysis. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, Incident Intelligence comes with a certain number of free incident events per month. (Our original pricing plan doesn't have a free tier.) You can track usage and cost in two places in the UI: In the usage UI From the Incident Intelligence system settings UI page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, then click Incident Intelligence, and then click System settings. Determine event source When you set up Incident Intelligence data sources, the incident events ingested by those sources are what count towards your total. To see the sources affecting your billing, go to the Sources page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, click Incident Intelligence, and then click Sources. Stop reporting events Go to the Incident Intelligence Sources UI page and disconnect all the sources you don’t want. If all sources are removed, no data is sent to Incident Intelligence. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

      "body": "When you create a dashboard, you add a variety of charts to visualize your New Relic telemetry data. These charts, offered out-of-the-box, are customizable in that you can: Resize and arrange their positions in your dashboard Update their names, display options, and underlying data queries But sometimes the charts we include in the platform aren't enough for you to get the most from your data. When you want to visualize your data in a specific way that isn't possible with our charts, you can build a custom visualization. New Relic is programmable. This means that if the platform doesn't solve your specific problem, you can write and deploy your own code to fill in some of those gaps. One area where programmability is valuable is in visualizing your data. While New Relic offers all the telemetry data that your apps and services report and provides many different kinds of charts to present that data, you might need to create something entirely unique. With the New Relic One SDK, we've provided you all the tools you'll need to create your own visualizations. Build your custom visualization With the New Relic One SDK, you can create a Nerdpack, which houses your visualization code. This code consists of a React component, logic, data queries, and external dependencies. The SDK also provides a component library that you can use to make NerdGraph requests, access platform state context, and more. Your first visualization To build your first custom visualization, install the New Relic One SDK and make sure you have the latest version: bash Copy $ nr1 update Create a Nerdpack and a visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name custom-viz ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ...my-first-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-first-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization custom-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz/visualizations/custom-viz\" The visualization you created in the my-first-viz Nerdpack contains a default component to help you get started. Serve your visualization locally: bash Copy $ cd my-first-viz $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ custom-viz https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Important To view the locally served visualization, you must use the nerdpacks=local querystring. Enter values into the fields under Configure visualization properties and see how the chart changes: Resources Here is a list of resources for building custom visualizations: Build a custom visualization for dashboards (Guide) Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK (Guide) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Customize your visualization You have a lot of control over how your visualization operates. You can choose what properties of the visualization are customizable, such as colors, sizes, and how you present your legend. You can choose whether it presents New Relic data or data from an external source. You can even install and use third-party components to create a specific look: Resources Here is a list of resources for configuring custom visualizations: Configuration options (Documentation) Customize visualizations with configuration (Guide) Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (Video) Use your custom visualization During development, you can serve your visualization locally. Under Apps > Custom Visualizations, you can view and configure your visualization to see how your data looks, but you can't instantiate that chart and use it in your account: To do that, you need to publish it to the New Relic One catalog and subscribe to it from your account. Because custom visualizations are Nerdpack items, you publish and subscribe to them the same way you publish and subscribe to New Relic One applications. Once you've done so, you can add your custom visualization to a dashboard: If you want to reuse your visualization to present different data or the same data in a new way, you can go back to Apps > Custom Visualizations, choose your visualization, configure another instance and add it to your dashboard: Resources Here is a list of resources for using custom visualizations: Add custom visualizations to your dashboards (Documentation) New Relic Dashboards and Custom Visualizations: Flexibility with Less Toil (Blog) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (Video)",

      "body": "One way for users to access your Nerdlet is by creating a launcher. The launcher opens a Nerdlet from the Apps page in New Relic. You can also provide access to your Nerdlet from an entity in your account. In this guide, you'll learn how to attach your Nerdlet to your entities. Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install and configure the New Relic One CLI Create a Nerdpack Step 1 of 5 Update your CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 5 Create a Nerdpack with the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name entity-nerdlet This results in a Nerdpack, called entity-nerdlet, which consists of a launcher, called entity-nerdlet-launcher, and a Nerdlet, called entity-nerdlet-nerdlet. Step 3 of 5 Serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ cd entity-nerdlet $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 4 of 5 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and navigate to Apps: ?nerdpacks=local is required to enable your locally served Nerdpacks to load in New Relic. Step 5 of 5 Under Your apps, click your launcher to view your New Relic One application: Attach your Nerdlet to entities You've seen how you can access your Nerdlet from a launcher. Now, access your Nerdlet from your entities. Step 1 of 6 From inside your Nerdpack's root directory, open nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json. This is your Nerdlet's metadata file. You'll use this file to attach your Nerdlet to entities. Step 2 of 6 Add a context object with an entities array: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [] 8 } 9 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy This tells New Relic that you want to surface your Nerdlet in an array of entity contexts. Step 3 of 6 Add an entity context: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [ 8 { 9 \"domain\": \"APM\", 10 \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" 11 } 12 ] 13 } 14 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Here, you've attached your Nerdlet to all application entities in the APM domain. Step 4 of 6 Go to APM: Because you're serving your Nerdpack locally, remember that you must still specify the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 5 of 6 Choose any of your applications: Step 6 of 6 Scroll down to see your Nerdlet attached to the application: Click this menu option and see your Nerdlet the same way you did with the launcher. Configure your entities context The context.entities key in your Nerdlet's nr1.json file specifies which entities your Nerdlet should be attached to. Specify an entity domain Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity domain by specifying the domain as one of the following values: APM: Application Performance Monitoring BROWSER: Browser INFRA: Infrastructure monitoring MOBILE: Mobile monitoring SYNTH: Synthetic monitoring For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities in the APM domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those in a domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"!APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities in multiple domains: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" }] } } Copy Specify an entity type Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity type by specifying the type as one of the following values: APPLICATION HOST MONITOR For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities of the APPLICATION type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those of a specified type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"!APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity whose type matches one of an array of types: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }, { \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }] } } Copy Specify entity tags Attach your Nerdlet to entities that have a given tag. For example, attach your Nerdlet to the entity which has a particular GUID: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"guid\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ENTITY GUID>\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity which has particular accountId and uses the Python programming language: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"accountId\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ACCOUNT ID>\"] }, { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Combine filters When you filter the entities to which your Nerdlet will be added, you can combine domain, type, and tags: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"domain\": \"APM\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\", \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] }, { \"domain\": \"SYNTH\", \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" } ] } } Copy In this example, you've attached your Nerdlet to: All APM applications whose metadata tags specify the python language AND all Synthetic monitors AND all Browser entities",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version If you already had the CLI, update it: bash Copy $ nr1 update Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

In the last lesson, you finished the A/B test application you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to prepare it for publication. When you publish your app to the New Relic One catalog, users can view it and subscribe to it. You can help your users by showing and telling them what the app does, how to use it, and more. Create catalog information To supply information to the catalog about your app, you need to create the catalog directory in your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 6 Change to the describe-app/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test Step 2 of 6 Create the catalog directories: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog This creates a root catalog directory with template files for inputting custom information about your app and a catalog directory for each Nerdpack item where screenshots can be stored. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog directory. Step 3 of 6 Update catalog/documentation.md: ## Documentation This application combines and presents data from New Relic and the Nerdsletter API so that we can make an informed decision on which design version results in more high-quality newsletter subscriptions. It also presents an button to end the test, which saves the date and version descriptions in local storage. We can use this app for future A/B tests as well! catalog/documentation.md Copy For this course, you're keeping the documentation concise by merely describing what the app does. In your own projects, you might also include instructions for contributing to the project in an open source context, installing the app's dependencies, or anything else that might help a user navigate complexities in your app or code. Step 4 of 6 Update catalog/config.json: { \"tagline\": \"Win @ newsletter subscriptions\", \"details\": \"Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course\", \"whatsNew\": \"Initial release!

In other projects, you might also add a support email or support links. Step 5 of 6 Save this screenshot to your catalog/screenshots directory. Users will be able to see a carousel of screenshots in your app's About page in the catalog. Step 6 of 6 Save the following icon as icon.png in two places: nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test/launchers/ab-test-launcher This will act as the launcher's icon and the app's catalog icon on the About page. Now you've added documentation, screenshots, metadata, and an icon to your app so that users will be able to understand what it does and why they might need it. For now, these files are all local and they need to be submitted to the catalog. But before you can do that, your app, itself, needs to be published to the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll publish your app, submit your catalog information, and view the results in New Relic.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Fetch data from a third-party service, before starting this one. In this course, you're building a New Relic One application. This application shows telemetry data from a demo service that is running an A/B test so that it can reveal that data in charts, like a dashboard. Your New Relic application is different than a dashboard, however, because it does more than show New Relic data. It pulls external data, provides UI components and functionality, and even has its own small data stores. The purpose of this New Relic application is to present context so you can better understand the A/B test results and how those results tie in to your business objectives. So far, you've built all your charts, organized them for improved usability, provided them with real data, and more. There are some final improvements you can make, using Platform API components. In this lesson, you learn how to use values in the New Relic platform state. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-platform-state-context/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, add a PlatformStateContext.Consumer to your NewsletterSignups component's render() method: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Notice that NrqlQuery uses a constant called ACCOUNT_ID. Instead of hardcoding an account identifier in your Nerdlet, you can use accountId from the platform URL state. Step 3 of 10 PlatformStateContext.Consumer provides access to the platform's URL state. This context contains an important value you'll use in your app, called timeRange. Notice that your NrqlQuery uses a SINCE clause that identifies the historical timeframe your query should fetch data from. Right now, that SINCE clause is set to 30 MINUTES AGO. With timeRange, you can use the platform's time picker to make this timeframe adjustable. Step 4 of 10 Utilize the platform state's timeRange: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, NewsletterSignups uses platformState.timeRange instead of a hardcoded SINCE clause. While NrqlQuery components accept a convenient timeRange prop, not every component does. You can still use timeRange in other contexts by accessing duration, begin_time, or end_time: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { console.log(platformState.timeRange.duration); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>; Copy Step 5 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test. Step 6 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 7 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 10 View your application: Your NrqlQuery now uses the platform state's timeRange, but your chart probably still shows the last 30 minutes. Why? Where does the timeRange in platform state come from? The time picker sits on the right side of your application's navigation bar: Change this value and see your chart update: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 9 of 10 Update VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Of all the charts in your New Relic One application, these three charts are the ones that should update with the time picker. The others, Total subscriptions per version, Total cancellations per version, Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions, Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, show total values over time. So, hardcoding their SINCE clauses to 7 DAYS AGO makes sense, as this is a reasonable time period for the purposes of this course. Step 10 of 10 While still serving your Nerdpack locally, view your NR1 app to see your charts updating with the time range you choose: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now that you're basing your queries off the platform state, some of your charts are dynamic in their time ranges. This is a great improvement because it allows you to adjust your charts to show data from any particular point in time, which is useful for tying data to business outcomes. The Platform API components offer a lot more functionality, too, including the ability to navigate the user to another place in New Relic. You'll learn how to do this in the next lesson.

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage.

When you build a New Relic One application, it's valuable to view it on the platform. This helps you design, implement, and debug your application in the environment it will eventually be published to. With nr1, you can launch a development server that hosts your application so that New Relic One can present it to you. Step 1 of 4 From inside the Nerdpack's root directory, serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve When the Nerdpack has succeeded building and your application is ready to view, you'll see a message with a link to New Relic One: bash Copy ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! Notice the appended query parameter nerdpacks=local. This query parameter tells New Relic to show locally served Nerdpacks. Tip If you don't see your application on the New Relic platform, make sure you've included nerdpacks=local in your querystring!

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add chart components to your A/B test application, before starting this one. In this course, you’re building an A/B test application for the New Relic platform. Previously, you learned about the New Relic One SDK and its component library. Now, It’s time for you to start building your application focusing first on chart components. Before you write any code, consult your design guide to remember what the application will look like when you finish: There are several charts you need to create, which may seem overwhelming at first, but take it one step at a time. The topmost chart, and the first you’ll create, is a line chart that shows the number of users who sign up for your newsletter and what version of your website they were shown. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-your-first-chart/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-your-first-chart/ab-test This directory contains the code your application should have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named newsletter-signups.js: bash Copy $ touch newsletter-signups.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a component called NewsletterSignups to hold your first LineChart and some mock data: import React from 'react'; import { LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } const versionBSignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-b-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 20 }, { x: 10, y: 5 }, { x: 20, y: 25 }, { x: 30, y: 45 }, { x: 40, y: 50 }, { x: 50, y: 35 }, ], } return <LineChart data={[versionASignups, versionBSignups]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Here, you’ve created two arbitrary data series which represent versions A and B of your test. Right now, you're using manually-crafted data points. In the future, you'll replace these with data queried from New Relic. Notice that you’ve specified a color for each series in the chart. The color metadata attribute takes any CSS-acceptable color format. Setting viz: 'main' means that you want to render the LineChart series as a line, the component's default display style. For the data prop in the LineChart component, you passed the two series in an array so that both are represented together. Finally, you used the chart’s fullWidth prop to stretch the chart’s width to fill the view. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and replace the default heading in your Nerdlet's render() method with your new component: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-your-first-chart/ab-test. Step 6 of 8 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 7 of 8 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the LineChart displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. In seven steps, you’ve breathed life into your New Relic One application. Instead of a bland “Hello world” message, your application now shows a colorful line chart with two mocked data series. These data series represent server-side traffic for each of the competing designs in your demo website. In the next lesson, you’ll build on this foundation by creating another chart type.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add your first chart, before starting this one. You’ve begun building your A/B test application. So far, it consists of a single line chart, which represents the number of subscriptions your newsletter receives from each version of your website. To understand what you’ll build in this lesson, review the design guide to remember what charts come next: In the design, there are two pie charts beneath the line chart that you’ve already created. One represents the distribution of users who receive version A and version B. The other represents the distribution of successful requests from users who got version A and version B. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-pie-charts/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course.

Because PieChart uses unidimensional data, its series only take y-values. Step 4 of 9 In total-cancellations.js, create a component, called TotalCancellations, which renders mocked cancellation data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new components and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add tables, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you added a variety of charts to your A/B test application. These charts presented different facets of information about your A/B test, and they behaved independently from one other. In this lesson, you’ll create a new pair of line charts and learn how to synchronize their behaviors. Before you write any new code, consult your design guide to understand the role that these new charts will play in your application: In the design guide, there is a line graph under each of the tables you created in the last lesson. These line graphs show the version-specific response times for newsletter signup requests. Now, you’ll build two more line charts, but this time, you’ll group them with a ChartGroup and specify that their values are measured in milliseconds. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-a-chart-group/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named page-views.js: bash Copy $ touch page-views.js Step 3 of 9 In this new file, create a component called VersionPageViews to hold a LineChart, which shows the number of times a page is viewed: import React from 'react'; import { LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Notice the new attribute in the series' metadata fields: units_data. This attribute describes the unit type for a specified data axis. In this case, you set the unit type for the y axis to 'MS', which stands for milliseconds. Other options for unit types, include: 'PERCENTAGE', 'TIMESTAMP', and 'BYTES_PER_SECOND'. Step 4 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In index.js, import ChartGroup from nr1 and group your VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <ChartGroup> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </ChartGroup> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Because the tables are conceptually related, as they show contrasting performance metrics over the same timeslice, it makes sense to group them in a ChartGroup. This means that the two charts behave synchronously. For example, when you hover over one chart, the other chart shows a hover indicator at the same x coordinate. Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the LineChart components synchronized in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Tip Each of the chart component types you've used in this lesson have had different series configurations. Most chart components share the same metadata attributes, like LineChart and PieChart, but differ in their data formats. It's helpful to be aware of the different data formats, for when you create your own charts. You can read more about the data formats in the chart component documentation. Now your application is filled with charts, but it doesn't look great. The charts are stacked on top of one another in an unhelpful way. In the next lesson, you'll learn about the user interface components from the SDK and how you can use them to organize your charts.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add your first chart, before starting this one. You’ve begun building your A/B test application. So far, it consists of a single line chart, which represents the number of subscriptions your newsletter receives from each version of your website. To understand what you’ll build in this lesson, review the design guide to remember what charts come next: In the design, there are two pie charts beneath the line chart that you’ve already created. One represents the distribution of users who receive version A and version B. The other represents the distribution of successful requests from users who got version A and version B. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-pie-charts/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add two new Javascript files: total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js bash Copy $ touch total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js Step 3 of 9 In total-subscriptions.js, create a component, called TotalSubscriptions, which renders mocked subscription data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Notice that the series data is formatted differently for PieChart than it was for LineChart. Because PieChart uses unidimensional data, its series only take y-values. Step 4 of 9 In total-cancellations.js, create a component, called TotalCancellations, which renders mocked cancellation data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new components and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the PieChart components displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Your application is starting to take shape. You’ve created a line chart and two pie charts. For now, these charts use mocked data, but you’ll provide them real data in a later lesson. Before you focus on the data in your charts, however, you’ll learn how to add a table to your application so you can visualize data in a new way.

      "body": "Log patterns are the fastest way to discover value in log data without searching. Log data is high volume telemetry with a low value per individual record. Searching can quickly lead to logs that provide a root cause explanation, but most data is repetitive and hard to contextualize when browsing. Patterns can make log data discoverable without spending a lot of time reading through low value data. Logs > Patterns: Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or for configuring drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Technical overview Log pattern functionality applies machine learning to normalize and group log messages that are consistent in format but variable in content. These grouped messages can be sorted, making it easy to find the most frequent or rarest sets of logs in your environment. Use patterns as the basis for alerts when the frequency of important data changes, or to configure drop rules to get rid of unnecessary repetitive data. Log patterns use advanced clustering algorithms to group together similar log messages automatically. With patterns, you can: Orient more quickly through millions of logs. Reduce the time it takes to identify unusual behavior in your log estate. Monitor the frequency of known patterns over time to focus your energy on what matters, and exclude what's irrelevant. Availability The ability to configure this feature is dependent on role-based permissions. For example, accounts still using our original pricing model require an Owner or Admin role. If you see Patterns are turned off in your Logs UI, click Configure patterns and enable it. If you don't see patterns within 30 minutes of enabling the feature, there may be a lack of data with a message attribute for the system to create a pattern from it. Log patterns Limitations and considerations Pricing There is no separate pricing for log patterns. The only cost is for additional data generated and added to your log records. A pattern attribute will be added to all logs that match a pattern. Attributes also may be added when common values are discovered, such as GUIDs, IP addresses, URL, or email addresses. These attributes are automatically extracted from the log message as part of the pattern process. HITRUST accounts The log patterns feature is not FedRAMP compliant. FedRAMP or other HITRUST accounts are not eligible to use patterns. Parsing limits We have a system of safety limits on memory and CPU resources when processing logs and their patterns. These parsing limits can have an impact on the data you get. For more information, see our documentation about parsing limits. Get started To start examining patterns: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs, and use the account picker dropdown to select the target account where you want to explore patterns. In the left navigation of the Logs UI, click Patterns. The main log UI changes to show patterns that match the query in the query bar. Logs > Log patterns: The line chart shows the top 5 patterns over time. Use the time picker and query bar to adjust the results. Explore log patterns By default the log patterns UI first shows the most frequent occurrence of patterns. To sort to show the rarest patterns first, click the Count column. You can also use the query bar or attributes bar to filter your log patterns. If you want to... Do this... Understand the rate of change in patterns Look at the line chart. The color-coded patterns correspond to the plot column in the table. You can toggle individual plot patterns to narrow your focus. See the individual log messages that match each pattern Click pattern to expand the row and see a table of individual log records. To see additional records, scroll up or down. To explore an individual log in more detail, click it to open the details panel. Group and filter patterns by their attributes Use the query bar and time picker. As you apply different filters and time windows, the log patterns adjust to your new target data. Create an alert from a pattern Add the pattern to the query bar and run the query. Then click Create alert condition in the left nav. Troubleshoot log messages that haven't been clustered into a pattern Use the Logs with no pattern tab in the Log patterns UI. Clicking a specific log message will open the log message details panel you're familiar with from the Logs management page. Explore logs with no pattern The Logs with no pattern tab groups all recent log messages in your account that were not clustered into a known pattern yet. These log messages don't represent any problem or flaw in the system; they have no pattern because they are too new to have been processed by the machine learning system. This makes them valuable to explore when you want to understand what has recently changed in your environment. Logs > Log patterns: New Relic's log patterns feature automatically groups logs without a matching pattern. For example: Are any of these logs tied to a recent problem? This is a quick way to discover unique log data that is appearing for the first time in your environment. Does your log data have a new format? Sometimes the logs don't represent a problem, but a new format of log data that deviates from the data model you expect your applications to follow. Catching these logs early gives you the opportunity to ask developers to correct any deviations in their log output. The more consistent people are in the way log data is generated, the easier it becomes to use logs across a diverse set of teams. Masked attributes and wildcards Parts of the log messages in patterns are classified as variables and are substituted by masked attributes. The masking process supports and improves the clustering phase by allowing the algorithm to ignore changing details and focus on the repetitive structure. Masked attributes include: date_time ip url uuid Masked attributes are highlighted and are easy to identify, as shown in the following example. Here is an example of a log pattern that has masked attributes. Log patterns extract other less trivial variables that don't belong to any masked attribute. These variables are indicated as wildcards *. Here is an example of how wildcards * group variables in the Log patterns UI. Troubleshooting Here are a few reasons why you have patterns enabled but do not see any pattern data. If you're sure none of these items are true, get help from support.newrelic.com. No data has arrived in the timeframe you're observing. Try expanding the time range you're viewing with the time picker. It's been less than 24 hours since patterns were enabled in the account. This means the ML model may not be generated for the account yet. None of the data coming in has a message field. Patterns will only be generated for values in the message field of a log record. If your logs don't contain message, there will be no data. Put the platform to work with patterns Patterns are a value that is enriched onto the existing log message as a new attribute named newrelic.logPattern. Anything you can do with logs generally can be done with log patterns, such as: Build your own dashboards with patterns, to monitor a specific pattern or group of patterns you care about. Create alerts for patterns by adding NRQL alerts. Use baseline alert conditions to detect anomalies in known log patterns.",

      "body": "When metrics are reported to New Relic via the Metric API (including from integrations that use that API), the data is reported as the Metric data type and is available for querying. This document contains: How to view and query your metrics Example metric queries How to query multiple metrics with wildcards How to explore metric data Query APM metric timeslice data APM reports a specific type of data that we call metric timeslice data. For how to query that, see Query metric timeslice data. For information about other types of metrics, see Metric data types. View and query your metrics You can use NRQL to query your metric data in the New Relic One query builder or using our NerdGraph API. To query a metric, use the following query format: FROM Metric SELECT function(metric_name) WHERE attribute=value FACET attribute TIMESERIES Copy Below are the functions supported for each metric type: Metric type Supported functions Summary count, sum, min, max, and average Count sum Gauge count, sum, min, max, average, and latest Add the names of the metrics you want to chart with the appropriate value functions in the SELECT clause. The WHERE and FACET clauses can be used with attribute values. Remember to include the keyword TIMESERIES if you want to chart the data. This example demonstrates how you could chart the CPU usage in seconds for cluster foo . This query breaks down CPU usage by container, given a count metric named container_cpu_usage_seconds_total with the attributes containerName and clusterName: FROM Metric select sum(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total) WHERE clusterName = 'foo' FACET containerName TIMESERIES Copy If you want the CPU usage per minute (the rate of change), then you can add the rate function to the query above. FROM Metric select rate(sum(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total), 1 minute) WHERE clusterName = 'foo' FACET containerName TIMESERIES Copy View example metric queries The previous examples demonstrate basic forms of metric queries, but NRQL can also be used to chart, explore, and analyze metric data. Chart multiple metrics Chart multiple metrics using a single query by providing a comma-separated list of metrics in the SELECT clause. For example, to chart the memory usage for a container along with the memory limit metric, use the following query: FROM Metric SELECT latest(container_memory_usage_bytes), latest(container_spec_memory_limit_bytes) WHERE containerName = 'inventory' TIMESERIES Copy You can also do this using wildcards, as explained below. Perform mathematical operations on metric data Perform math operations on one or more metrics to compute a new, derived metric. To monitor available memory, you can calculate the percentage of available memory from the two metrics used in the previous example: FROM Metric SELECT (latest(container_spec_memory_limit_bytes) - latest(container_memory_usage_bytes)) / latest(container_spec_memory_limit_bytes) * 100 AS '% Memory Available' WHERE containerName = 'inventory' TIMESERIES Copy You can also do this using wildcards, as explained below. Use filters to select specific time series In addition to using a WHERE clause which applies to everything in SELECT, NRQL provides another aggregation function called filter which can be used to select a specific time series to be charted or operated on. The following example charts a memory usage metric labeled \"Total (k8s)\" which is computed by adding together the memory usage of two specific containers within a pod: FROM Metric SELECT filter( latest( container_memory_usage_bytes), WHERE containerName = 'discovery') + filter( latest( container_memory_usage_bytes), WHERE containerName = 'istio-proxy') AS 'Total (k8s)' WHERE clusterName = 'my-cluster' AND podName LIKE 'istio-pilot-%' TIMESERIES Copy View the raw metric data points When querying metric data using FROM Metric, New Relic automatically selects the specific aggregate to use in the query, depending on the length of the query window and any bucket size specified as an argument to the TIMESERIES keyword. This ensures efficient querying and chart resolution. If you want to override this behavior to view or operate on the raw metric data points, use the optional RAW keyword in your query. When querying these raw metric data points, there is a query time window limit of 48 hours. Any query attempting to access more than 48 hours of raw metric data will result in a query error. This example shows how to list the last 20 data points received for a particular metric: FROM Metric SELECT * WHERE metricName = 'container_fs_usage_bytes' LIMIT 20 RAW Copy Query multiple metrics with wildcards Wildcards are represented in NRQL by the % character. If you want to query multiple metrics that use a standard naming convention, you can use the wildcard feature to return results for all of them without having to specify each metric name individually. Wildcards can help you: Aggregate metrics together and chart the results FACET results by metric name in a chart Find and chart all metrics matching a given naming convention Wildcards are particularly helpful if you later add new metrics matching an existing naming convention. By using % instead of writing out each metric name in your query, you won't have to rewrite the query when you add new metrics. Let's say you have multiple algorithms that perform a similar task. You can define the following metrics, which show the duration of the different algorithms: myNeatProcess.algorithm1.duration myNeatProcess.algorithm2.duration myNeatProcess.algorithm3.duration If used in a query, myNeatProcess.%.duration will return results for all three of the algorithms above. If you later create new algorithms named algorithm4, algorithm5, and algorithm6, the same query will return results for all six algorithms. Chart multiple metrics with wildcards You can chart multiple metrics using a single query by using wildcards (%) in the SELECT clause. For example, to query all the algorithms in the example above and plot a line on the chart for each algorithm's average duration, use the following query: FROM Metric SELECT average(myNeatProcess.%.duration) FACET metricName TIMESERIES Copy Perform mathematical operations on metric data with wildcards You can also use wildcards to perform math operations on multiple metrics and compute a new metric. You can calculate the mean duration for all algorithms listed in the example above: FROM Metric SELECT average(myNeatProcess.%.duration) TIMESERIES Copy You can calculate what percentage of overall runtime a single algorithm takes: FROM Metric SELECT myNeatProcess.algorithm1.duration / sum(myNeatProcess.%.duration) TIMESERIES Copy Return results for invidual fields using getField() Metrics have multiple fields associated with them, and each field contains its own unique values. If you would like to extract one of those values using a query, you can do that with getField(). For example, if you want to use a single value within a metric to do a comparison in a WHERE clause, you can use getField(metricName, field) or metricName[field]. List of gauge metrics This example query returns a list of gauge metrics: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE %[type] = 'gauge' Copy List all metric names for a particular host The average value of a metric is computed as total over count, so the following query returns metric data where the result of the average() value function is greater than 2. FROM Metric SELECT average(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE appName = 'MyApp' AND apm.service.transaction.duration[total] / apm.service.transaction.duration[count] > 2 Copy Explore metric data The NRQL keyset and uniques functions can be used together with the metricName attribute (available on all metrics) to perform tasks like listing all the available metrics in your account or discovering the attributes available on a particular metric. List all metric names in an account FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) Copy List all metric names for a particular host FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE hostname = 'host1.mycompany.com' Copy Show the attribute keys for a specific metric FROM Metric SELECT keyset() WHERE metricName = METRIC_NAME Copy",

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020 and haven't migrated your users to the new model, your users are on our original user model (and not the New Relic One model). If you're an admin and want to see if you have users on the original model: If you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Updates about our new user model In July of 2020, we released a new user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more older customers to the new model. Some older customers are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this: Click the account dropdown, click Account settings, and then click Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) and full user upgrades Note that billing-related aspects of your count of full users only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. To control how basic users upgrade to become full users, from the Users and roles UI you can select Access requests. You have two options: Automatic approval: With this option, basic users can automatically upgrade to be full users. This option allows your users to more easily troubleshoot problems. Require review: With this option, your admins get a notification when basic users request an upgrade and must upgrade them first. You can approve them either from the notification email or from the user's entry in the Users and roles UI. For more about user type, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to our more curated observability UI experiences (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Depending on access request settings, basic users can either upgrade themselves to be full users or request upgrade access from admins. Full user. Details: Full users have access to everything (dependent on role restrictions), which includes our curated observability UI experiences, such as APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user is considered a full user and has full user access on all accounts in that organization. For how to edit a user's type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of user permissions. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads. Link dashboards to workloads and save filters. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute these functions, assign the workloads manager add-on role.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add tables, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you added a variety of charts to your A/B test application. These charts presented different facets of information about your A/B test, and they behaved independently from one other. In this lesson, you’ll create a new pair of line charts and learn how to synchronize their behaviors. Before you write any new code, consult your design guide to understand the role that these new charts will play in your application: In the design guide, there is a line graph under each of the tables you created in the last lesson. These line graphs show the version-specific response times for newsletter signup requests. Now, you’ll build two more line charts, but this time, you’ll group them with a ChartGroup and specify that their values are measured in milliseconds. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-a-chart-group/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named page-views.js: bash Copy $ touch page-views.js Step 3 of 9 In this new file, create a component called VersionPageViews to hold a LineChart, which shows the number of times a page is viewed: import React from 'react'; import { LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Notice the new attribute in the series' metadata fields: units_data. This attribute describes the unit type for a specified data axis. In this case, you set the unit type for the y axis to 'MS', which stands for milliseconds. Other options for unit types, include: 'PERCENTAGE', 'TIMESTAMP', and 'BYTES_PER_SECOND'. Step 4 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In index.js, import ChartGroup from nr1 and group your VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <ChartGroup> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </ChartGroup> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Because the tables are conceptually related, as they show contrasting performance metrics over the same timeslice, it makes sense to group them in a ChartGroup. This means that the two charts behave synchronously. For example, when you hover over one chart, the other chart shows a hover indicator at the same x coordinate. Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the LineChart components synchronized in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Tip Each of the chart component types you've used in this lesson have had different series configurations. Most chart components share the same metadata attributes, like LineChart and PieChart, but differ in their data formats. It's helpful to be aware of the different data formats, for when you create your own charts. You can read more about the data formats in the chart component documentation. Now your application is filled with charts, but it doesn't look great. The charts are stacked on top of one another in an unhelpful way. In the next lesson, you'll learn about the user interface components from the SDK and how you can use them to organize your charts. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. When you're ready, continue on to the next lesson: Add user interface components to your application.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add user interface components to your application, before starting this one. In previous hands-on lessons, you created all the charts from your design guide. Unfortunately, they aren’t laid out like they are in the design. The New Relic One SDK provides multiple solutions for organizing your components. The one you’ll learn about in this lesson is the Grid component. To arrange your charts, place them in a Grid. A Grid is a container you use to organize your content into 12-column rows. A GridItem is the building block for a Grid. You specify the columnSpan of a GridItem between 1 and 12 to determine how much of the row that the GridItem should cover. So, if you want a chart to stretch across the width of the view, you would place the chart in a GridItem with a columnSpan of 12. If you want twelve charts to fit in a single row, use a columnSpan of 1. Using the design guide as a base, you can plan how to organize your Grid: Once you’ve planned out how you’re going to arrange your columns, you can write some code to realize your plans. Step 1 of 6 Change to the add-a-grid/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import Grid and GridItem. Then, update your Nerdlet's render() method by placing each chart in a GrildItem. Finally, place all your items in a Grid: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy The columnSpan for each chart matches the layout plan. Every chart that takes up half the 12-column row has a columnSpan of 6, and every chart that takes up the whole row has a columnSpan of 12. Notice that each of the charts in the ChartGroup, but not the ChartGroup itself, is in a GridItem. A ChartGroup connects charts' behaviors, not their locations. Each chart fills its columnSpan because they use the fullWidth prop. fullWidth makes the chart fill its available horizontal space and GridItem.columnSpan restricts that space to some fraction of the row. Remove a fullWidth prop, and see how the chart reacts. Technical detail Notice the wrapper class applied to the Grid. We quietly provided some CSS styles to help make this app look great! This isn't a CSS course, so we won't cover everything we added, we'll just include the styles we intend for you to use in the code snippets. Just know that every UI component in the New Relic One SDK provides a className prop where you can provide a CSS class name. You can view the styles in nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see your charts styled and arranged in a grid. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. In just six steps, you significantly improved the readability and usability of your A/B test application, but you can take further steps to improve the usability of your charts. In the next lesson, you’ll add headings to your charts to remind yourself of what data each chart presents. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. When you're ready, continue on to the next lesson: Add chart headings.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add NrqlQuery components to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In this series, you're creating a New Relic One application, or NR1 app for short, that shows A/B test data in a variety of charts. Most of the charts need to show data that comes from a demo service you spun up at the beginning of this series. To refresh your memory on what you're building, review your design guide: In the last lesson, you supplied real data, which comes from New Relic's database, to the following charts: Newsletter subscriptions per version Version A - Page views Version B - Page views Total subscriptions per version Because you have experience querying subscription and page view data, you may feel ready to supply data to even more charts: Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions However, these charts are different than the charts you've supplied data to because they compare data from two different sources: subscription events and pageView events. In this lesson, you learn how to format data from multiple sources to exist in the same chart. Experiment with data in the Data explorer Step 1 of 6 From your New Relic homepage's top navigation menu, go to to the Data explorer: Here, you can experiment with subscription event and pageView event queries to make sure you fetch the right data in your app. Step 2 of 6 Select subscription from the Custom events menu: This queries NRDB for subscription event totals per minute over the last 30 minutes and shows that data in a chart: Step 3 of 6 Click Dimensions to see a list of the attributes associated with these subscription events: You can filter and group subscription events using these dimensions. For Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, you want to filter your subscription totals by page_version. Step 4 of 6 Click the NRQL query to navigate to the Query builder: Here, you can view and manually edit the query to fetch the data you need. Step 5 of 6 Add a WHERE clause to filter subscription totals by page_version: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Remove the TIMESERIES clause to fetch a count: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO Copy Modify the SINCE clause to see totals over the past week: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO Copy Click Run and see the data visualized in a billboard chart instead of a line chart: Step 6 of 6 Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions need a combined total of four data values: All-time subscription totals for version A All-time page view totals for version A All-time subscription totals for version B All-time page view totals for version B Experiment with the Query builder to discover the four queries which pull the right data. In the end, you'll come up with the following four queries: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'b' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = 'b' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO Copy technical detail Unlike other structured query languages, NRQL doesn't provide a mechanism for joining data across sources. This is why you have to perform two queries to get subscription event totals and pageView event totals. Until now, you've provided every chart with a single query. Here, you have to provide two queries per chart. In the remaining steps, you'll learn how to customize NrqlQuery results to merge data from multiple sources. Merge NRQL from multiple sources Step 1 of 9 Change to the customize-nrql-data/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/customize-nrql-data/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 9 In your Nerdlet's totals.js file, implement constructor() and the React lifecycle method componentDidMount() in VersionTotals: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { tableData: { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } } } componentDidMount() { NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[0].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[1].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[this.state.tableData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Here, you initialize your state in the component's constructor. The state has a single value, tableData, which holds series data and metadata for the TableChart. In componentDidMount(), you query the data that populates the data in this state. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that is called when a component is mounted in the component tree. You use this method, instead of the constructor, to query data because your logic, which requests data from New Relic, introduces side effects and sets state values, neither of which you should do in the constructor. In componentDidMount(), you use NrqlQuery in a new way. First, you specified the formatType to NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW because you're going to modify the data instead of supplying it directly to a chart Before, you used its JSX form in the render() method of a chart. Second, you called its query() method and handled the results in a then() callback, which logs them to the console. Step 3 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, create a constant called ACCOUNT_ID and pass it to VersionTotals: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/ Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 4 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/customize-nrql-data/ab-test. Step 5 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 6 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Navigate to your app in New Relic. Step 7 of 9 To view your logs, which are useful for uncovering errors in your application, turn on developer tools in your favorite browser and navigate to the Console: FireFox instructions Safari instructions Chrome instructions With your app on-screen, notice the NRQL data in the console: This console log tells you that you can find the data you're looking for, namely the subscription or pageView count, at data.raw.results[0].count. The next step is to store that count in state.tableData. Tip If something doesn't work, use these debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 8 of 9 In totals.js, store the query data in state: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { tableData: { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } } } componentDidMount() { NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[0].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[1].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[this.state.tableData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Pay close attention to the data you're accessing. The array indices are particularly important to get right. The subscription data should go to state.tableData.data[0].count because in tableData, it is the first element in the data array: data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], Copy By similar logic, page view data should go to state.tableData.data[1].count. Step 9 of 9 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID In this lesson, you learned how to use NrqlQuery.query() to fetch data from multiple sources and stitch them together into data your chart can use. Notice that there are still two charts in your NR1 application that use mock data: Total unsubscriptions per version Past tests Unfortunately, your demo application doesn't create custom New Relic events when a user unsubscribes from your newsletter or you end an A/B test. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to populate Past tests.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Persist the selected version, before starting this one. In this tutorial, you're building an A/B test application. The application surfaces data about an ongoing A/B test on your website, which you then use to decide which page design version is most effective at engaging users. As part of that overarching goal, you're building a section which allows you to end the test by deciding a winner of the experiment: Unfortunately, there are a few issues with the code and design for this section. By the end of this course, pressing End test will tell your website's backend server that every customer should see the version selected here. This is destructive behavior because it makes an irreversible change to your website. To account for the desctructiveness of pressing End test, you need to modify some features of your application: Make the button look important to catch your eye Prompt yourself with a confirmation message before ending the test to ensure you don't end it prematurely Show and hide your confirmation modal Step 1 of 12 Change to the present-confirmation-modal/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test This directory contains the code your application should have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 12 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, update the Button to use the DESTRUCTIVE styling: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Tip Read more about Button and its props on the New Relic developer site. Step 3 of 12 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test. Step 4 of 12 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 12 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 12 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: Now you've styled your button to convey its destructive consequences, but that's not enough to prevent you from accidentally clicking it. Next, you create a shield for your website's backend. This extra layer of protection requires you to confirm that you intend to end the test before actually doing so. Step 7 of 12 Add a Modal to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Your new modal contains a heading, a confirmation message, the winning design version, and two buttons. You'll explore some of these components later in this course. With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your new Modal: Tip Remember, while your server is running, it will update automatically when you save your code. The modal looks great, but it has three issues: It was present before you clicked End test You can't dismiss it It always says you selected \"Version A\", even if you didn't In the following steps, you'll correct all three of these issues. Step 8 of 12 In EndTestButton, initialize state with a value for modalHidden: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy modalHidden determines whether or not to hide the modal. The default value of modalHidden is true because you only want to show the modal when you select End test. Step 9 of 12 Supply modalHidden to the Modal: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy First, you've created a constructor to accept component props. This provides your component access to the modalHidden prop that you passed in EndTestSection. Then you provide the value of modalHidden to the Modal component's hidden prop. Tip Read more about Modal and its props on the New Relic developer site. Step 10 of 12 Add and bind two new methods to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Use closeModal and showModal to close and show your modal, respectively, depending on how a user interacts with the modal. Step 11 of 12 Show the modal when you click End test: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you've supplied showModal() as the callback for the Button component's onClick event. Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. The modal is hidden by default. Click End test to see the modal. Step 12 of 12 Close the modal from the Modal component's onClose callback and from the Yes, end test and No, continue test buttons: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Click End test. The modal opens and displays your confirmation message. Close the modal by clicking X at the top right, either of its buttons, or even in the dark space to its left. Notice that the modal says you chose \"Version A\", even if you choose \"Version B\". This is because \"Version A\" is hardcoded in the Modal text. Next, you'll make that dynamic. Use the version you selected in your modal Step 1 of 2 In EndTestSection, pass selectedVersion to the EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Now, you can access the selected version from the EndTestButton component's props. Step 2 of 2 Use selectedVersion in your confirmation message: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Select \"Version B\" from the menu. Click End test to see \"Version B\" in the confirmation modal: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Congratulations! You've done a lot of work and it shows in the usefulness of your application. You've created charts that show mocked data. You've organized your charts into a readable structure. You've added an interface for your users to interact with the test. Now, you need some real data. In the next lesson, you'll replace the mocked data in your charts with real data from your backend service.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Fetch data from a third-party service, before starting this one. In this course, you're building a New Relic One application. This application shows telemetry data from a demo service that is running an A/B test so that it can reveal that data in charts, like a dashboard. Your New Relic application is different than a dashboard, however, because it does more than show New Relic data. It pulls external data, provides UI components and functionality, and even has its own small data stores. The purpose of this New Relic application is to present context so you can better understand the A/B test results and how those results tie in to your business objectives. So far, you've built all your charts, organized them for improved usability, provided them with real data, and more. There are some final improvements you can make, using Platform API components. In this lesson, you learn how to use values in the New Relic platform state. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-platform-state-context/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, add a PlatformStateContext.Consumer to your NewsletterSignups component's render() method: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Notice that NrqlQuery uses a constant called ACCOUNT_ID. Instead of hardcoding an account identifier in your Nerdlet, you can use accountId from the platform URL state. Step 3 of 10 PlatformStateContext.Consumer provides access to the platform's URL state. This context contains an important value you'll use in your app, called timeRange. Notice that your NrqlQuery uses a SINCE clause that identifies the historical timeframe your query should fetch data from. Right now, that SINCE clause is set to 30 MINUTES AGO. With timeRange, you can use the platform's time picker to make this timeframe adjustable. Step 4 of 10 Utilize the platform state's timeRange: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, NewsletterSignups uses platformState.timeRange instead of a hardcoded SINCE clause. While NrqlQuery components accept a convenient timeRange prop, not every component does. You can still use timeRange in other contexts by accessing duration, begin_time, or end_time: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { console.log(platformState.timeRange.duration); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>; Copy Step 5 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test. Step 6 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 7 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 10 View your application: Your NrqlQuery now uses the platform state's timeRange, but your chart probably still shows the last 30 minutes. Why? Where does the timeRange in platform state come from? The time picker sits on the right side of your application's navigation bar: Change this value and see your chart update: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 9 of 10 Update VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Of all the charts in your New Relic One application, these three charts are the ones that should update with the time picker. The others, Total subscriptions per version, Total cancellations per version, Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions, Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, show total values over time. So, hardcoding their SINCE clauses to 7 DAYS AGO makes sense, as this is a reasonable time period for the purposes of this course. Step 10 of 10 While still serving your Nerdpack locally, view your NR1 app to see your charts updating with the time range you choose: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now that you're basing your queries off the platform state, some of your charts are dynamic in their time ranges. This is a great improvement because it allows you to adjust your charts to show data from any particular point in time, which is useful for tying data to business outcomes. The Platform API components offer a lot more functionality, too, including the ability to navigate the user to another place in New Relic. You'll learn how to do this in the next lesson. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Add navigation to your nerdlet.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you used PlatformStateContext from the New Relic One SDK to look up the time range that the user selected from the app's time picker. Now, you'll learn about another component that interacts with the New Relic platform: navigation. The navigation component lets you open entities, navigate to entities, and build Location objects for entities from your Nerdlet. You can also use navigation for other Nerdlets and launchers. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-navigation/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In newsletter-signups.js, create a new method, called NewsletterSignups.openApmEntity(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. This method uses navigation.openStackedEntity() to display your demo application's APM entity in a stacked view. Notice openApmEntity() requires your ENTITY_GUID. You need to locate that ID and store it in a constant. Step 3 of 10 Navigate to APM: See metadata for your Newsletter service: Copy the entity's GUID: Create an ENTITY_GUID constant: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and the entity GUID you just copied, respectively. Now, openApmEntity() knows what entity to show. Next, you need to create a button to invoke this method. Step 4 of 10 Create a button to show your APM entity: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you've created a button and configured it to call openApmEntity() when it's clicked. Step 5 of 10 Import Stack and StackItem: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. You'll use Stack and StackItem to lay out the button on the far right side of the same row that the HeadingText is on. Step 6 of 10 Lay out the Stack: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <Stack fullWidth> <StackItem grow={true}> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> </StackItem> <StackItem> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> </StackItem> </Stack> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you used a full-width Stack to set up the layout for the row. To make the HeadingText fill the entire row except the width of the button, you used the StackItem.grow prop. Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. Click App performance: Now you see the stacked entity: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively Congratulations! You're finished writing all the code you'll write for your New Relic One A/B test application. Now, you have an application reporting New Relic data from your demo service that is running an A/B test. You've created several charts, buttons, and other UI elements. And you've organized your components into a readable and usable view. On top of the visuals, you've supplied data to your charts from multiple data sources in and outside of New Relic. You've created some backend functionality which utilizes your New Relic One application's own data store. You've also utilized the platform APIs for interacting with platform UI and showing a stacked entity view. You've really accomplished a lot throughout this course, so far. There are only a few things left to do! First, is to learn how to publish and subscribe to your New Relic One application so that it can run on our platform instead of your own local server. Second, is to learn how to deal with some common issues you might see in New Relic One application development. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Describe your app for the catalog.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add a new configuration option Step 1 of 8 In your visualization's nr1.json file, add an enum configuration object for selectedChart: index.js nr1.json 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 Radar: 'radar', 24 Treemap: 'treemap', 25 }; 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

Step 4 of 8 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The nerdpacks=local query string directs the UI to load your visualization from the local server.

In this guide, you learn how to: Use the nr1 CLI to generate a default visualization Run your visualization locally where you can quickly test and iterate Publish your visualization to the New Relic One catalog Add your visualization to a dashboard Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create a new visualization Use nr1 to generate the boilerplate for a new visualization. Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called my-awesome-visualization, in a Nerdpack, called my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name my-awesome-visualization ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ... my-awesome-nerdpack ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-awesome-nerdpack is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization my-awesome-visualization is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Before you begin Explore our custom visualization guides and build your first visualization. After you're done, you'll have a better foundation for building more complex visualizations, such as the one you'll build in this course. Finally, if you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create your visualization Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called radar-or-treemap, in a Nerdpack, called alternate-viz: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name radar-or-treemap ✔ You’re trying to create a visualization outside of a Nerdpack. We’ll create a Nerdpack for you—what do you want to name it? … alternate-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack alternate-viz is available at \"./alternate-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization radar-or-treemap is available at \"./alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/radar-or-treemap directory under alternate-viz: bash Copy $ cd alternate-viz $ ls visualizations/radar-or-treemap index.js nr1.json styles.scss Set up your component state Add component state to the default visualization template that nr1 created for you. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap/index.js. You'll work in here for the rest of this lesson.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type. Use SegmentedControl and SegmentedControlItem to switch between the two chart types. Tip To learn more about the components available in the New Relic One SDK, go to our Intro to New Relic One SDK.

      "info": "Build a \"Hello, World!\" app and publish it to New Relic One",
      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One Apps overlay. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

      "body": "Serve your Nerdpack locally when it's still in development and you're not ready to share it with others. You'll use your own machine's resources, but you'll see the Nerdpack in the New Relic platform as you would if it were published. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Serve your Nerdpack locally Step 1 of 5 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run the nerdpack:serve command: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve If you've successfully served your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! While your Nerdpack is being served locally, the server will automatically reload your Nerdpack when it detects that you've modified a file. This doesn't include the metadata file nr1.json or the styles file styles.css. If you update those files, you need to stop your local server with CTRL+C and restart it with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 5 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local: New Relic requires the ?nerdpacks=local query string to load locally served Nerdpacks. Step 3 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Whether you're creating a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Apps. Step 4 of 5 If you're serving a Nerdpack with a launcher and a Nerdlet, you'll find your local app under Your apps: If you're serving a Nerdpack with a visualization, go to Favorite apps > Custom Visualizations: Tip If Custom Visualizations isn't favorited, you can find it under Your apps. From Custom Visualizations, you'll see your visualization: Whether you're serving a Nerdpack for an app or a visualization, you'll see a </> Local indicator on its UI tile. Use this to distinguish between published Nerdpacks and locally served Nerdpacks. Step 5 of 5 When you're ready to stop serving your Nerdpack locally, type CTRL+C into your terminal where the server is running. Resolve issues with accessing your local Nerdpack Sometimes, when you serve your Nerdpack locally, you may come across issues. You may be unable to serve your Nerdpack because of bugs in your code. Or, you may successfully serve your Nerdpack but be unable to find it in New Relic. Consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your application When you attempt to serve your Nerdpack locally, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve --verbose Show locally served Nerdpacks If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, make sure you're using the ?nerdpacks=local query string. If you're not, New Relic won't load your locally served Nerdpack on the platform. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you serve your Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:serve, you must be signed into the same profile in New Relic that you're serving with locally. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic and you're using the correct query string, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same. Access your proxy browser Generally, you don't need to know how your application code is loaded in New Relic. But understanding how it works can help you resolve issues with your local server. When you run nr1 nerdpack:serve, your code is served by your local machine using an nr-local.net subdomain. This domain points to 127.0.0.1, and uses a variety of ports to connect, including 9973. To load a Nerdpack into the platform, whether it's locally served or published to the Instant Observability catalog, New Relic uses an <IFRAME> and a separate domain (a subdomain of nr-ext.net), relying on same-domain policy to sandbox the code. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, you're using the correct query string, and you're using the correct profile, your network administrator may need to enable access to: Any subdomain of nr-local.net, or, at the very least, to any domain of the shape of <UserId>.nr-local.net, where <UserId> is a 32-hexadecimal character identifier that is unique to the user logged into the platform. You can use [0-9a-f]{32} to discriminate it. Any subdomain of nr-ext.net, or, at the very least, to any domain in the shape of <NerdpackUuid>.g <NerdpackGid>.nr-ext.net, where <NerdpackUuid> is the UUID assigned to your package, and <NerdpackGid> is zero, or a positive integer. You can use 0|[1-9]\\d+ to discriminate it. Further reading Read the nr1 nerdpack:serve documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve --help",

Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Instant Observability: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack using the apps filter or search bar: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the Instant Observability catalog.

Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel.

Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:unset --help Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you subscribe to a Nerdpack, you may run into issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions When you publish your Nerdpack, it's registered with the Instant Observability catalog. From there, some users can subscribe to your Nerdpack. Subscribing users need to have: Access to the account that published the Nerdpack The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Update your package version You can only publish a package version to the Instant Observabiltiy catalog one time. For example, you can't publish two instances of version 1.0.0. So, each time you want to deploy a new version of your code, you need to increment its version in the Nerdpack's package.json file: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy Tip Nerdpack versions follow semantic versioning. Read the documentation to learn more. Generate a UUID for your Nerdpack If you built your Nerdpack from scratch with nr1 create --type nerdpack, then your Nerdpack has a unique identifier. Find this identifier in the root directory's nr1.json file: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"DemoApp\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack demo-app\" } nr1.json Copy This ID must be unique to your Nerdpack when you publish it to the catalog. The platform will reject your Nerdpack if it recognizes the ID. So, if you cloned an existing Nerdpack or are otherwise using open source code, generate a new UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --generate --force Tip Read the nr1 nerdpack:uuid documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --help Publish your Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish If you've successfully published your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This output describes the published Nerdpack. First, it states the Nerdpack's ID (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890). Then, its version (1.0.0). Finally, its version tag (STABLE). You already managed your Nerdpack's ID and version, but the version tag is new. To manage your Nerdpack's versions, you can tag them with an arbitrary tag. For example, if a version is still in development, you can tag it with a DEV tag. If the version moves to a QA phase, you can tag it with QA. If it's ready for production, you can tag it with STABLE. Tip Read our tag guide to learn more. Use the -t or --tag option to publish your Nerdpack with a tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag DEV As you saw in the nr1 nerdpack:publish output, if you don't pass a tag, nr1 applies the STABLE tag automatically. However, you can tell it to not apply any tags to a release with the -T or --skip-tag option: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --skip-tag You can also perform a dry run to make sure you publish your Nerdpack the way you want to: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --dry-run Step 2 of 4 Once you've successfully published your Nerdpack, go to New Relic: Because you're going to view a published Nerdpack, rather than a locally served one, you don't need to pass the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to Instant Observability: Whether you published a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Instant Observability. Step 4 of 4 Find your published Nerdpack using the Apps filter or search bar: Tip Only Nerdpacks with tagged versions are shown in Instant Observability. So, if you published without a tag or removed a tag from your published Nerdpack, you won't see it in the catalog. Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you publish your Nerdpack, you may come across issues. Whether you can't publish your Nerdpack due to some issue with your code or you can't find your Nerdpack in Instant Observability, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your command When you attempt to publish your Nerdpack, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. For example: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack DemoApp (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890) › Error: There is already a Nerdpack with given id & version. › Code: 409 It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --verbose Reveal your published Nerdpack information If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, it may not be tagged. Remember, at least one version of your published Nerdpack must have a tag for it to show on the Apps page. See more information about your published Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:info: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 3014918 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 3 hours ago In this example, there is one published version, but it isn't tagged. You can tag a published version with: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --from-version=1.0.0 --tag=DEV Now, if you refresh your browser page, you should see your Nerdpack on Apps. Tip Read our nr1 nerdpack:tag documentation to learn more. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you publish your Nerdpack, only users who can access your account can see your published Nerdpack. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic but you know it's published, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same.",

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the first four steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create and publish your Nerdpack Create a Nerdpack with a visualization. You'll add this visualization to a dashboard using NerdGraph. Further reading Because this guide is about using visualizations, not creating and publishing them, it breezes over these topics. If you're unfamiliar with visualizations or would like a thorough explanation of dealing with visualization Nerdpacks, check out the following resources: Introduction to custom visualizations Build your first custom visualization If you already have a visualization you'd like to add to a dashboard, you can skip this section. But don't forget to make the necessary code adjustments to reference your visualization instead of the one this guide uses, called my-awesome-visualization. Step 1 of 4 Update your nr1 CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Now, you have the latest version. Step 2 of 4 Create a visualization, called my-awesome-visualization, in a Nerdpack, called my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 create -t visualization -n my-awesome-visualization ✔ You’re trying to create a visualization outside of a Nerdpack. We’ll create a Nerdpack for you—what do you want to name it? … my-awesome-nerdpack ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-awesome-nerdpack is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization my-awesome-visualization is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization\" When you build a visualization with nr1 create, you get a default visualization. You'll use this default visualization throughout this course. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to your new Nerdpack: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack From here, you can run nr1 nerdpack commands. Step 4 of 4 Publish and subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Now, that your account is subscribed to your visualization, you can describe your app configurations with JSON and add it to a dashboard with NerdGraph. Describe your visualization options with JSON Whether you're adding your visualization to a new dashboard or an existing one, you need to send your configuration to NerdGraph. Your custom visualization JSON object represents a dashboard widget and consists of the following fields: Field Type Description title String Title for your dashboard widget visualization JSON The metadata for your visualization visualization.id String Your visualization's ID rawConfiguration JSON A full configuration of your widget Tip You can also add other types of widgets to dashboards with the steps in this guide, but the fields described here are specific to custom visualization widgets. For other widget types, you need to supply different data. Explore the API on your own with our NerdGraph explorer! Step 1 of 5 Start with a JSON template based on the fields you need to describe your custom visualization: { \"title\": \"\", \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"\" }, \"rawConfiguration\": {} } Copy Step 2 of 5 Give your visualization widget a title: { \"title\": \"My Awesome Visualization\", \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"\" }, \"rawConfiguration\": {} } Copy Step 3 of 5 Look up your Nerdpack ID from my-awesome-nerdpack/nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack my-awesome-nerdpack\" } my-awesome-nerdpack/nr1.json Copy Then, look up your visualization ID from my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"VISUALIZATION\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-visualization\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeVisualization\", \"description\": \"\", \"configuration\": [ { \"name\": \"nrqlQueries\", \"title\": \"NRQL Queries\", \"type\": \"collection\", \"items\": [ { \"name\": \"accountId\", \"title\": \"Account ID\", \"description\": \"Account ID to be associated with the query\", \"type\": \"account-id\" }, { \"name\": \"query\", \"title\": \"Query\", \"description\": \"NRQL query for visualization\", \"type\": \"nrql\" } ] }, { \"name\": \"fill\", \"title\": \"Fill color\", \"description\": \"A fill color to override the default fill color\", \"type\": \"string\" }, { \"name\": \"stroke\", \"title\": \"Stroke color\", \"description\": \"A stroke color to override the default stroke color\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json Copy Set your visualization widget's visualization.id to the form {NERDPACK-ID}.{VISUALIZATION-ID}: { \"title\": \"My Awesome Visualization\", \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, \"rawConfiguration\": {} } Copy Step 4 of 5 In my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json, review your configuration options: { \"schemaType\": \"VISUALIZATION\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-visualization\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeVisualization\", \"description\": \"\", \"configuration\": [ { \"name\": \"nrqlQueries\", \"title\": \"NRQL Queries\", \"type\": \"collection\", \"items\": [ { \"name\": \"accountId\", \"title\": \"Account ID\", \"description\": \"Account ID to be associated with the query\", \"type\": \"account-id\" }, { \"name\": \"query\", \"title\": \"Query\", \"description\": \"NRQL query for visualization\", \"type\": \"nrql\" } ] }, { \"name\": \"fill\", \"title\": \"Fill color\", \"description\": \"A fill color to override the default fill color\", \"type\": \"string\" }, { \"name\": \"stroke\", \"title\": \"Stroke color\", \"description\": \"A stroke color to override the default stroke color\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json Copy The name fields in configuration are important for describing your visualization widget. Step 5 of 5 Using the name field for every configuration object in your visualization's nr1.json file, build a rawConfiguration for your widget: { \"title\": \"My Awesome Visualization\", \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1234567, \"query\": \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], \"fill\": \"pink\", \"stroke\": \"green\" } } Copy Here, you've created a rawConfiguration by supplying values for each configuration option in nr1.json. Note that nrqlQueries is an array because its type is collection. The other values are strings. Learn more about these configuration options in Configure your custom visualization. Now that you've described your visualization widget in JSON, you can add your configured visualization to a dashboard. In the next section, you'll learn how to create a new dashboard with your visualization. If you already have one ready, skip ahead to add your visualization to your existing dashboard. Create a new dashboard with your visualization If you want to create a new dashboard for your visualization widget, use NerdGraph's dashboardCreate() mutation. The NerdGraph dashboardCreate() mutation takes the following fields: Field Type Description accountId Integer The ID for the account for which you want to create your dashboard dashboard JSON The details of the dashboard you're creating dashboard.name String The name of your dashboard dashboard.permissions Enum: PRIVATE, PUBLIC_READ_ONLY, PUBLIC_READ_WRITE The access control of your dashboard dashboard.pages Array: JSON The details of your dashboard's pages dashboard.pages[].name String The name of the dashboard page dashboard.pages[].widgets Array: JSON The widgets to add to the dashboard page Tip You can also pass more fields to dashboardCreate() to add details, widgets, and more. Explore the API on your own with our NerdGraph explorer! In this guide, you create a dashboard with a single page that contains a single widget—the visualization widget you described in the last section. Step 1 of 5 Build out a GraphQL mutation template based on the fields you need to describe your dashboard in dashboardCreate(): mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 0, dashboard: { name: \"\", pages: [ { name: \"\", widgets: [] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) } Copy Here, you've defined the template for a private dashboard. Now, it's time to fill in the details. Step 2 of 5 Look up your account ID and enter it for your accountId: mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1234567, dashboard: { name: \"\", pages: [ { name: \"\", widgets: [] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) } Copy Step 3 of 5 Select a name for your dashboard and its page: mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1234567, dashboard: { name: \"My Awesome Dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"One Page to Rule Them All\", widgets: [] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) } Copy Step 4 of 5 In widgets, place the widget object you created in the last section: mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1234567, dashboard: { name: \"My Awesome Dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"One Page to Rule Them All\", widgets: [ { title: \"My Awesome Visualization\", visualization: { id: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [ { accountId: 1234567, query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], fill: \"pink\", stroke: \"green\" } } ] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) } Copy Step 5 of 5 Finally, add the return fields to your mutation: mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1234567, dashboard: { name: \"My Awesome Dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"One Page to Rule Them All\", widgets: [ { title: \"My Awesome Visualization\", visualization: { id: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [ { accountId: 1234567, query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], fill: \"pink\", stroke: \"green\" } } ] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) { entityResult { guid } } } Copy Important Make sure you replace the IDs in your mutation query with ones that match your account, Nerdpack, and visualization. Now, you have a mutation ready to send to NerdGraph to create single-page dashboard with a widget for your custom visualization. As a result, you'll see the new dashboard's entity GUID. In the next section, you'll learn how to add your visualization to an existing dashboard. If that's not relevant to your goals, skip ahead to send your request to NerdGraph. Add your visualization to an existing dashboard To add your visualization widget to an existing dashboard, use NerdGraph's dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() mutation. The NerdGraph dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() mutation takes the following fields: Field Type Description guid String The entity GUID for the dashboard to which you're adding your widgets widgets Array: JSON The widgets to add to the dashboard page Tip You can also pass more fields to dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() to add details, widgets, and more. Explore the API on your own with our NerdGraph explorer! Step 1 of 4 Build out a GraphQL mutation template based on the fields you need to describe your dashboard in dashboardAddWidgetsToPage(): mutation { dashboardAddWidgetsToPage( guid: \"\" widgets: [] ) { errors { description } } } Copy Step 2 of 4 Look up your dashboard's GUID and enter it for guid: mutation { dashboardAddWidgetsToPage( guid: \"AbCdEFghIJkLMNo1PQRSTUVWXYZAbCD2Ef34GHI\" widgets: [] ) { errors { description } } } Copy Step 3 of 4 In widgets, place the widget object you created in Describe your visualization options with JSON: mutation { dashboardAddWidgetsToPage( guid: \"AbCdEFghIJkLMNo1PQRSTUVWXYZAbCD2Ef34GHI\" widgets: [ { visualization: { id: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [ { accountId: 1234567, query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], fill: \"pink\", stroke: \"green\" } }, ] ) } Copy Step 4 of 4 Finally, add the return fields to your mutation: mutation { dashboardAddWidgetsToPage( guid: \"AbCdEFghIJkLMNo1PQRSTUVWXYZAbCD2Ef34GHI\" widgets: [ { visualization: { id: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [ { accountId: 1234567, query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], fill: \"pink\", stroke: \"green\" } }, ] ) { errors { description } } } Copy Now, you have a mutation ready to send to NerdGraph to add your custom visualization to an existing dashboard. As a result, you'll see descriptions of any thrown errors to help you debug issues. The last thing you need to do is actually send your request to NerdGraph. Send your request to NerdGraph Send an HTTP request to NerdGraph with the payload you built in previous sections for the mutation that best suits your needs. There are many tools you can use to send an HTTP request, but in this guide, you learn how to communicate with NerdGraph using three specific tools: NerdGraph API explorer cURL New Relic CLI If you use another, you can adapt these methods for your favorite development tool. NerdGraph API explorer The NerdGraph API explorer is an implementation of GraphiQL that lets you explore the NerdGraph APIs. Step 1 of 4 Go to the NerdGraph API explorer. Step 2 of 4 Select or create a new API key: Step 3 of 4 In the center console, paste your mutation query: Important Make sure you replace the IDs in your mutation query with ones that match your account, Nerdpack, and visualization. Step 4 of 4 Press Execute Query and see the results in the right pane: If you successfully created a new dashboard, your response has an entity GUID. If you don't have an entity GUID, the response contains error messages to help you debug your query. If you added your visualization to an existing dashboard, you won't see errors in the response. If you do see error messages, use them to debug your query. Explore The NerdGraph API explorer lets you see other fields and change your query without typing everything manually. Use the left pane to explore NerdGraph. cURL cURL is a command line utility for making HTTP requests. Step 1 of 2 Select or create a New Relic user key. Copy this key, because you use it in the next step. Step 2 of 2 Make a request to NerdGraph, using cURL: bash Copy $ curl https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ > -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ > -H 'API-Key: <YOUR-USER-KEY>' \\ > --data-binary '{\"query\": \"mutation {dashboardCreate(dashboard: {name: \\\"My Awesome Dashboard\\\", pages: [{name: \\\"One Page to Rule Them All\\\", widgets: [{title: \\\"My Awesome Visualization\\\", visualization: {id: \\\"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\\\"}, rawConfiguration: {nrqlQueries: [{accountId: 3014918, query: \\\"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\\\"}], fill: \\\"pink\\\", stroke: \\\"green\\\"}}]}], permissions: PRIVATE}, accountId: <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID>) { entityResult { guid }}}\", \"variables\": \"\"}' Important Make sure you replace the IDs in your mutation query with ones that match your account, Nerdpack, and visualization. Here, you send a request to NerdGraph that has two headers, Content-Type and API-Key, and a binary message body containing one of the mutation queries you built in previous sections. If you prefer to use a UI-based client, like Postman, you can adapt this method to a format that your client supports. New Relic CLI The newrelic is a command line interface for reading and writing New Relic data. Step 1 of 2 If you haven't already, install newrelic by following the first two steps of our Get started with the New Relic CLI guide. Once you've done that, you will have newrelic installed and configured for making NerdGraph requests. Step 2 of 2 Make a NerdGraph request using newrelic nerdgraph query: bash Copy $ newrelic nerdgraph query 'mutation { $ dashboardCreate( $ accountId: 1234567, $ dashboard: { $ name: \"My Awesome Dashboard\", $ pages: [ $ { $ name: \"One Page to Rule Them All\", $ widgets: [ $ { $ title: \"My Awesome Visualization\", $ visualization: { $ id: \"de0b4768-1504-4818-a898-da7cd14f0bfb.my-awesome-visualization\" $ }, $ rawConfiguration: { $ nrqlQueries: [ $ { $ accountId: <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID>, $ query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" $ } $ ], $ fill: \"pink\", $ stroke: \"green\" $ } $ } $ ] $ }, $ ], $ permissions: PRIVATE $ } $ ) { $ entityResult { $ guid $ } $ } $ }' Important Make sure you replace the IDs in your mutation query with ones that match your account, Nerdpack, and visualization. View your new dashboard Now that you've built a dashboard with NerdGraph, it's time to check your work! Step 1 of 4 Go to New Relic. Step 2 of 4 Navigate to Dashboards: Step 3 of 4 Select your new dashboard: Step 4 of 4 View your dashboard: The dashboard you created has the name you passed in your mutation, \"My Awesome Dashboard\". It also has the configuration you sent in rawConfiguration, from the NRQL data query to the fill and stroke colors. Summary Congratulations! In this guide, you used NerdGraph, New Relic's GraphQL API, to add your custom visualization to a dashboard.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One Apps overlay. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

      "body": "When you create a dashboard, you add a variety of charts to visualize your New Relic telemetry data. These charts, offered out-of-the-box, are customizable in that you can: Resize and arrange their positions in your dashboard Update their names, display options, and underlying data queries But sometimes the charts we include in the platform aren't enough for you to get the most from your data. When you want to visualize your data in a specific way that isn't possible with our charts, you can build a custom visualization. New Relic is programmable. This means that if the platform doesn't solve your specific problem, you can write and deploy your own code to fill in some of those gaps. One area where programmability is valuable is in visualizing your data. While New Relic offers all the telemetry data that your apps and services report and provides many different kinds of charts to present that data, you might need to create something entirely unique. With the New Relic One SDK, we've provided you all the tools you'll need to create your own visualizations. Build your custom visualization With the New Relic One SDK, you can create a Nerdpack, which houses your visualization code. This code consists of a React component, logic, data queries, and external dependencies. The SDK also provides a component library that you can use to make NerdGraph requests, access platform state context, and more. Your first visualization To build your first custom visualization, install the New Relic One SDK and make sure you have the latest version: bash Copy $ nr1 update Create a Nerdpack and a visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name custom-viz ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ...my-first-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-first-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization custom-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz/visualizations/custom-viz\" The visualization you created in the my-first-viz Nerdpack contains a default component to help you get started. Serve your visualization locally: bash Copy $ cd my-first-viz $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ custom-viz https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Important To view the locally served visualization, you must use the nerdpacks=local querystring. Enter values into the fields under Configure visualization properties and see how the chart changes: Resources Here is a list of resources for building custom visualizations: Build a custom visualization for dashboards (Guide) Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK (Guide) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Customize your visualization You have a lot of control over how your visualization operates. You can choose what properties of the visualization are customizable, such as colors, sizes, and how you present your legend. You can choose whether it presents New Relic data or data from an external source. You can even install and use third-party components to create a specific look: Resources Here is a list of resources for configuring custom visualizations: Configuration options (Documentation) Customize visualizations with configuration (Guide) Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (Video) Use your custom visualization During development, you can serve your visualization locally. Under Apps > Custom Visualizations, you can view and configure your visualization to see how your data looks, but you can't instantiate that chart and use it in your account: To do that, you need to publish it to the New Relic One catalog and subscribe to it from your account. Because custom visualizations are Nerdpack items, you publish and subscribe to them the same way you publish and subscribe to New Relic One applications. Once you've done so, you can add your custom visualization to a dashboard: If you want to reuse your visualization to present different data or the same data in a new way, you can go back to Apps > Custom Visualizations, choose your visualization, configure another instance and add it to your dashboard: Resources Here is a list of resources for using custom visualizations: Add custom visualizations to your dashboards (Documentation) New Relic Dashboards and Custom Visualizations: Flexibility with Less Toil (Blog) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (Video)",

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another. Step 4 of 4 In index.js, change your component's Radar.fillOpacity: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 } from 'recharts'; 10 import {Card, CardBody, HeadingText, NrqlQuery, Spinner, AutoSizer} from 'nr1'; 11 12 export default class MyAwesomeVisualizationVisualization extends React.Component { 13 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 14 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Before you begin Explore our custom visualization guides and build your first visualization. After you're done, you'll have a better foundation for building more complex visualizations, such as the one you'll build in this course. Finally, if you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create your visualization Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called radar-or-treemap, in a Nerdpack, called alternate-viz: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name radar-or-treemap ✔ You’re trying to create a visualization outside of a Nerdpack. We’ll create a Nerdpack for you—what do you want to name it? … alternate-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack alternate-viz is available at \"./alternate-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization radar-or-treemap is available at \"./alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/radar-or-treemap directory under alternate-viz: bash Copy $ cd alternate-viz $ ls visualizations/radar-or-treemap index.js nr1.json styles.scss Set up your component state Add component state to the default visualization template that nr1 created for you. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap/index.js. You'll work in here for the rest of this lesson.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type. Use SegmentedControl and SegmentedControlItem to switch between the two chart types. Tip To learn more about the components available in the New Relic One SDK, go to our Intro to New Relic One SDK.

Step 1 of 3 Import Treemap from recharts: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 'Radar': 'radar', 24 'Treemap': 'treemap' 25 } 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

The SegmentedControl and RadarChart are at the top of the view, but if you scroll down, you'll see your new Treemap: Switch between charts with your component's state Use state.selectedChart to determine which chart to show: the RadarChart or the Treemap. Step 1 of 1 Destructure this.state to access selectedChart as a separate constant. Then, compare selectedChart to CHART_TYPES.Radar. If they are the same, render a RadarChart.

For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and errorBeacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Note: You only need to modify the beacon and errorBeacon properties in the NREUM.info object. These values will override the default values found in the NR loader script. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "Publish your Nerdpack, whether it's still in development, ready for testing, or stable, to share it with others. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions When you publish your Nerdpack, it's registered with the Instant Observability catalog. From there, some users can subscribe to your Nerdpack. Subscribing users need to have: Access to the account that published the Nerdpack The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Update your package version You can only publish a package version to the Instant Observabiltiy catalog one time. For example, you can't publish two instances of version 1.0.0. So, each time you want to deploy a new version of your code, you need to increment its version in the Nerdpack's package.json file: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy Tip Nerdpack versions follow semantic versioning. Read the documentation to learn more. Generate a UUID for your Nerdpack If you built your Nerdpack from scratch with nr1 create --type nerdpack, then your Nerdpack has a unique identifier. Find this identifier in the root directory's nr1.json file: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"DemoApp\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack demo-app\" } nr1.json Copy This ID must be unique to your Nerdpack when you publish it to the catalog. The platform will reject your Nerdpack if it recognizes the ID. So, if you cloned an existing Nerdpack or are otherwise using open source code, generate a new UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --generate --force Tip Read the nr1 nerdpack:uuid documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --help Publish your Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish If you've successfully published your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This output describes the published Nerdpack. First, it states the Nerdpack's ID (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890). Then, its version (1.0.0). Finally, its version tag (STABLE). You already managed your Nerdpack's ID and version, but the version tag is new. To manage your Nerdpack's versions, you can tag them with an arbitrary tag. For example, if a version is still in development, you can tag it with a DEV tag. If the version moves to a QA phase, you can tag it with QA. If it's ready for production, you can tag it with STABLE. Tip Read our tag guide to learn more. Use the -t or --tag option to publish your Nerdpack with a tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag DEV As you saw in the nr1 nerdpack:publish output, if you don't pass a tag, nr1 applies the STABLE tag automatically. However, you can tell it to not apply any tags to a release with the -T or --skip-tag option: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --skip-tag You can also perform a dry run to make sure you publish your Nerdpack the way you want to: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --dry-run Step 2 of 4 Once you've successfully published your Nerdpack, go to New Relic: Because you're going to view a published Nerdpack, rather than a locally served one, you don't need to pass the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to Instant Observability: Whether you published a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Instant Observability. Step 4 of 4 Find your published Nerdpack using the Apps filter or search bar: Tip Only Nerdpacks with tagged versions are shown in Instant Observability. So, if you published without a tag or removed a tag from your published Nerdpack, you won't see it in the catalog. Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you publish your Nerdpack, you may come across issues. Whether you can't publish your Nerdpack due to some issue with your code or you can't find your Nerdpack in Instant Observability, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your command When you attempt to publish your Nerdpack, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. For example: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack DemoApp (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890) › Error: There is already a Nerdpack with given id & version. › Code: 409 It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --verbose Reveal your published Nerdpack information If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, it may not be tagged. Remember, at least one version of your published Nerdpack must have a tag for it to show on the Apps page. See more information about your published Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:info: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 3014918 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 3 hours ago In this example, there is one published version, but it isn't tagged. You can tag a published version with: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --from-version=1.0.0 --tag=DEV Now, if you refresh your browser page, you should see your Nerdpack on Apps. Tip Read our nr1 nerdpack:tag documentation to learn more. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you publish your Nerdpack, only users who can access your account can see your published Nerdpack. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic but you know it's published, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same.",

See Basic users for more information. Nerdpack permissions: Original user model Learn the differences between how basic users, full users, and admins can use and manage Nerdpacks in the original user model. Basic users If you're a basic user in the original user model, you're limited in your Nerdpack capabilities. You can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally. To publish, tag, subscribe to, and use your Nerdpacks, an admin must upgrade you to a full user. Tip If you're a basic user, you generally can't use any Nerdpacks. However, there are some Nerdlets that New Relic maintains that you can use. These are rare and there is currently no way for you to distinguish them in our web interface. And even if you can use a Nerdlet in a Nerdpack, you're never able to use custom visualizations. For this, you must be upgraded to a full user. Full users If you're a full user in the original user model, you either: Have the Nerdpack Manager add-on role Don't have the Nerdpack Manager add-on role The Nerdpack Manager role is required to publish, subscribe to, and tag Nerdpacks. So if you don't have the Nerdpack Manager role, you can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally and use Nerdpacks that your accounts have already been subscribed to. To publish, tag, or subscribe to a Nerdpack, an admin must upgrade you to a full user or grant you the Nerdpack Manager add-on role. Owner/Admin users If you're an owner or admin user, you can perform any of the Nerdpack capabilities. You can create, serve, publish, tag, subscribe to, and use any and all Nerdpack items, both Nerdlets and visualizations. This includes Nerdpacks built by New Relic or by one of your accounts. Nerdpack permissions: New Relic One user model Learn the differences between how basic users and full users can use and manage Nerdpacks in the New Relic One user model. Basic users If you're a basic user in the New Relic One user model, you're limited in your Nerdpack capabilities. You can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally. To publish, tag, subscribe to, and use your Nerdpacks, an admin must upgrade you to a full user. Tip If you're a basic user, you generally can't use any Nerdpacks. However, there are some Nerdlets that New Relic maintains that you can use. These are rare and there is currently no way for you to distinguish them in our web interface. And even if you can use a Nerdlet in a Nerdpack, you're never able to use custom visualizations. For this, you must be upgraded to a full user. Full users If you're a full user in the New Relic One user model, you either: Have the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege Don't have the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege The Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege is required to publish, subscribe to, and tag Nerdpacks. So if you don't have the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege, you can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally and use Nerdpacks that your accounts have already been subscribed to. To publish, tag, or subscribe to your Nerdpack, an admin must grant you the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege. Tip The Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege is included in both the User and Admin groups, the only groups available by default. So in most cases, you'll have the ability to manage Nerdpacks as a full user. However, if you're a full user assigned to a custom group that doesn't include the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege, you won't be able to manage Nerdpacks. Master/Sub-account Capabilities Some accounts, called master accounts, have sub-accounts that report data back up to them. This organizational hierarchy affects Nerdpack capabilities. In general, the flow of control moves downstream: In this example scenario A, the master account publishes a Nerdpack. This means that all three accounts, Master, Account 1, and Account 2, can subscribe to it. If you subscribe the master account to the Nerdpack, then users of all three accounts can use it. If you subscribe Account 1 to it, only Account 1 users can use it, because neither Master nor Account 2 is downstream in the hierarchy. In scenario B, the sub-account, Account 1, publishes a Nerdpack, so you can't use or subscribe to the Nerdpack from Master or Account 2.",

      "body": "When you create a dashboard, you add a variety of charts to visualize your New Relic telemetry data. These charts, offered out-of-the-box, are customizable in that you can: Resize and arrange their positions in your dashboard Update their names, display options, and underlying data queries But sometimes the charts we include in the platform aren't enough for you to get the most from your data. When you want to visualize your data in a specific way that isn't possible with our charts, you can build a custom visualization. New Relic is programmable. This means that if the platform doesn't solve your specific problem, you can write and deploy your own code to fill in some of those gaps. One area where programmability is valuable is in visualizing your data. While New Relic offers all the telemetry data that your apps and services report and provides many different kinds of charts to present that data, you might need to create something entirely unique. With the New Relic One SDK, we've provided you all the tools you'll need to create your own visualizations. Build your custom visualization With the New Relic One SDK, you can create a Nerdpack, which houses your visualization code. This code consists of a React component, logic, data queries, and external dependencies. The SDK also provides a component library that you can use to make NerdGraph requests, access platform state context, and more. Your first visualization To build your first custom visualization, install the New Relic One SDK and make sure you have the latest version: bash Copy $ nr1 update Create a Nerdpack and a visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name custom-viz ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ...my-first-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-first-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization custom-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz/visualizations/custom-viz\" The visualization you created in the my-first-viz Nerdpack contains a default component to help you get started. Serve your visualization locally: bash Copy $ cd my-first-viz $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ custom-viz https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Important To view the locally served visualization, you must use the nerdpacks=local querystring. Enter values into the fields under Configure visualization properties and see how the chart changes: Resources Here is a list of resources for building custom visualizations: Build a custom visualization for dashboards (Guide) Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK (Guide) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Customize your visualization You have a lot of control over how your visualization operates. You can choose what properties of the visualization are customizable, such as colors, sizes, and how you present your legend. You can choose whether it presents New Relic data or data from an external source. You can even install and use third-party components to create a specific look: Resources Here is a list of resources for configuring custom visualizations: Configuration options (Documentation) Customize visualizations with configuration (Guide) Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (Video) Use your custom visualization During development, you can serve your visualization locally. Under Apps > Custom Visualizations, you can view and configure your visualization to see how your data looks, but you can't instantiate that chart and use it in your account: To do that, you need to publish it to the New Relic One catalog and subscribe to it from your account. Because custom visualizations are Nerdpack items, you publish and subscribe to them the same way you publish and subscribe to New Relic One applications. Once you've done so, you can add your custom visualization to a dashboard: If you want to reuse your visualization to present different data or the same data in a new way, you can go back to Apps > Custom Visualizations, choose your visualization, configure another instance and add it to your dashboard: Resources Here is a list of resources for using custom visualizations: Add custom visualizations to your dashboards (Documentation) New Relic Dashboards and Custom Visualizations: Flexibility with Less Toil (Blog) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (Video)",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add navigation to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you finished the A/B test application you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to prepare it for publication. When you publish your app to the New Relic One catalog, users can view it and subscribe to it. You can help your users by showing and telling them what the app does, how to use it, and more. Create catalog information To supply information to the catalog about your app, you need to create the catalog directory in your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 6 Change to the describe-app/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test Step 2 of 6 Create the catalog directories: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog This creates a root catalog directory with template files for inputting custom information about your app and a catalog directory for each Nerdpack item where screenshots can be stored. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog directory. Step 3 of 6 Update catalog/documentation.md: ## Documentation This application combines and presents data from New Relic and the Nerdsletter API so that we can make an informed decision on which design version results in more high-quality newsletter subscriptions. It also presents an button to end the test, which saves the date and version descriptions in local storage. We can use this app for future A/B tests as well! catalog/documentation.md Copy For this course, you're keeping the documentation concise by merely describing what the app does. In your own projects, you might also include instructions for contributing to the project in an open source context, installing the app's dependencies, or anything else that might help a user navigate complexities in your app or code. Step 4 of 6 Update catalog/config.json: { \"tagline\": \"Win @ newsletter subscriptions\", \"details\": \"Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course\", \"whatsNew\": \"Initial release! Includes:\\n- A variety of charts for understanding the test results\\n- An end test button for storing some test data in a table\", \"support\": { \"email\": { \"address\": \"\" }, \"issues\": { \"url\": \"\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"\" } } } catalog/config.json Copy Here, you've specified a tagline, project details, the source code repository, and a short list of everything included in the initial release. In other projects, you might also add a support email or support links. Step 5 of 6 Save this screenshot to your catalog/screenshots directory. Users will be able to see a carousel of screenshots in your app's About page in the catalog. Step 6 of 6 Save the following icon as icon.png in two places: nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test/launchers/ab-test-launcher This will act as the launcher's icon and the app's catalog icon on the About page. Now you've added documentation, screenshots, metadata, and an icon to your app so that users will be able to understand what it does and why they might need it. For now, these files are all local and they need to be submitted to the catalog. But before you can do that, your app, itself, needs to be published to the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll publish your app, submit your catalog information, and view the results in New Relic.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Install and configure the New Relic One CLI, before starting this one. A Nerdpack is a package that contains all the files that make up a New Relic One application or visualization. Nerdpacks include files for metadata, Nerdlets, assets, and more. To create a Nerdpack, use the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack When nr1 prompts for a component name, use \"ab-test\" and watch the tool create the foundations of your Nerdpack. Once it's finished, explore the files it created for you. Root directory At the root level, you have a directory called ab-test. Everything inside this directory is part of the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls ab-test README.md nerdlets nr1.json package.json launchers node_modules package-lock.json Readme.md provides instructions for creating Nerdpack elements and serving your application locally. This and nr1 --help are useful if you forget how to interact with your Nerdpack using the command line tool. Javascript files package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules are important for running your JavaScript application, but aren't unique to Nerdpacks. You can learn about these modules from JavaScript courses should you need to tweak them. For now, take a look at nr1.json, one of the most relevant files in this directory. Metadata file nr1.json is the Nerdpack's metadata file, containing a schema type, unique identifier, a display name, and a description. Since you’re building a New Relic One application for running and analyzing A/B tests, update the package's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and set the description to \"A/B test your application using New Relic One\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"311bcd0c-f7eb-4285-afed-4219179bf91d\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"A/B test your application using New Relic One.\" } nr1.json Copy It's good to describe your application's purpose, especially if you're going to publish your application for others to use. Next, look at the launchers and nerdlets subdirectories. Launchers launchers is a directory because you can create multiple launchers for your New Relic One application. nr1 create only created one launcher for your Nerdpack and called it \"ab-test-launcher\". Inside its directory, there are two files: icon.png is an image that represents the application nr1.json is the launcher's metadata file Use \"A/B Test Launcher\" for the launcher's displayName and \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\" for the description in nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"ab-test-launcher\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test Launcher\", \"description\": \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\" } launchers/ab-test-launcher/nr1.json Copy Notice that the launcher has a rootNerdletId. This identifies the Nerdlet that the launcher opens when it's selected. This Nerdpack has only one Nerdlet, called ab-test-nerdlet, but some Nerdpacks may have multiple. Make sure that you set the rootNerdletId to the Nerdlet you want the launcher to open. Nerdlets The nerdlets directory contains all the Nerdlets that make up your New Relic One application. Since ab-test-nerdlet is the only Nerdlet in this Nerdpack, there is only one subdirectory. In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, there are three files: index.js is the JavaScript file that contains your Nerdlet component styles.scss holds the Sass stylesheet for your Nerdlet nr1.json contains the Nerdlet's metadata Update your Nerdlet's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and description to \"Control and view results of your A/B test\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"Control and view results of your A/B test\" } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Now, you've customized your Nerdpack, Nerdlet, and launcher with informative display names and descriptions, but what does your application actually do? Check out index.js to see what your default Nerdlet looks like: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, ab-test-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you have AbTestNerdletNerdlet, which nr1 created for you. It's a React component that renders a first-level welcome heading. Because this is the root Nerdlet, as specified in your launcher's nr1.json file, when you click on your launcher in the New Relic platform, the launcher will open a view that displays this heading. Tip In this lesson, you used nr1 create to create a Nerdpack, complete with a launcher and a Nerdlet. If you want to create another Nerdlet or Launcher in your Nerdpack, you can also do that with nr1 create: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdlet $ nr1 create --type launcher You can even skip the --type flag and select an option from a list: bash Copy $ nr1 create ? What kind of component do you want to create? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit. nerdpack ❯ nerdlet - create a/an Nerdlet Nerdpack item inside your Nerdpack. launcher catalog visualization In the next lesson, you'll learn how to serve your Nerdpack locally and see your app in action! Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Serve your New Relic One application.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One Apps overlay. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions To subscribe to a Nerdpack, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can subscribe to them: Publish your Nerdpack Tag your Nerdpack if it's published and doesn't yet have a tag Subscribe to a Nerdpack Subscribe to a published Nerdpack, with either the web UI or the nr1 CLI, to use it in your account. Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Instant Observability: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack using the apps filter or search bar: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the Instant Observability catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel. Tip nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:unset. Read the nr1 subscription:unset documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:unset --help Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you subscribe to a Nerdpack, you may run into issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

      "body": "The Insights Dashboard API is deprecated, but you can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to create and configure dashboards. If you're not migrating from the old Insights API, you can skip this doc and go to the new Dashboards API. Why a new dashboards API? Our Insights product, which was a way to query data and create charts and dashboards, has been deprecated and its set of features moved over to be a core part of the New Relic One platform. To learn more about this transition and new features, see the Insights to New Relic One migration guide. The Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated in July of 2021. Until then, if you're using the Insights Dashboard API, you should attempt to switch over to using NerdGraph. (The Insights query API will not be deprecated but NerdGraph is preferred.) Keep reading to learn how to get started with NerdGraph and learn about equivalent operations. Get started with NerdGraph NerdGraph is the preferred API for making NRQL queries of your New Relic data. Every user who uses NerdGraph needs their own user key. When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. If you're new to NerdGraph and GraphQL, you may want to first read our Introduction to NerdGraph and some of Create dashboards with NerdGraph. The NerdGraph API explorer is located at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Operations mapping table The table below maps every Insights API operation to the new dashboards API. Insights API operation NerdGraph API query/mutation Notes List (GET) entitySearch() View a paginated list of dashboards that match the filter.

By using the NerdGraph API explorer, you can discover GraphQL types and fields, along with a brief explanation. We want to facilitate your migration from the Insights API to the new New Relic One dashboards API. Find below some examples that illustrate how the old REST endpoints map to the new GraphQL queries or mutations. List (GET) -> entitySearch query Dashboards in New Relic One embrace the concept of entity. They are now another entity in New Relic’s entity ecosystem. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. List all dashboard entities you have access to { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by name { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {name: \"My dashboard\"}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s email { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD, tags: {key: \"createdBy\", value: \"email@domain.com\"}}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s user id { actor { entitySearch(query: \"type ='DASHBOARD' and ownerId = '2357322'\") { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy Show (GET) -> entity query In order to get information on a dashboard, all you need is to provide its unique entity identifier or entity guid. Then you can access all the dashboard properties that you are interested in by adding them in the GraphQL query. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Get dashboard info given its entity guid { actor { entity(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { ... on DashboardEntity { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } } Copy Create (POST) -> dashboardCreate mutation Operations that mutate the state of the system are mutations in GraphQL APIs. You can create a dashboard by providing the required input for the dashboardCreate mutation. Although GraphQL APIs aim to be self-explanatory, Nerdgraph docs can help you with some information about the fields, like the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Create dashboard with two pages and two widgets per page mutation { dashboardCreate(accountId: 1, dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.markdown\" }, title: \"My markdown widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { text: \"#My markdown\" } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.billboard\" }, title: \"My billboard widget with thresholds\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" }], thresholds: [{ alertSeverity: WARNING, value: 650 }, { alertSeverity: CRITICAL, value: 1500 }] } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Update (PUT) -> dashboardUpdate mutation The dashboardUpdate mutation allows you to update an existing dashboard by providing the existing dashboard guid and the new configuration. Similarly to creating a dashboard, the mutation tries to be self-explanatory, but you can look up the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Update previously created dashboard to 1 page and 1 widget per page mutation { dashboardUpdate(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\" dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Delete (DELETE) -> dashboardDelete mutation The dashboardDelete mutation allows you to delete an existing dashboard by providing its entity guid. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Delete previously created dashboard mutation { dashboardDelete(guid:\"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { status errors { type description } } } Copy",

      "body": "Use New Relic's metrics API service to define rules for creating metrics from your other types of data, such as events, logs, or spans. Recommendation: Before you begin, review our requirements and tips for creating rules. Create a metrics rule To create a rule for creating metrics from events, logs, or spans: Construct the metrics rule using NRQL. Construct a NerdGraph (GraphQL format) API request that contains your NRQL rule. Create the metric by making the API request. Once a metric is created, you can query and chart it using NRQL. Step 1. Create NRQL query rule The most important part of creating a metrics rule is constructing the NRQL query that defines the metric for your data from events, logs, or spans. You can create up to 10 metrics with a single NRQL query by following this procedure: Using New Relic's NRQL interface, construct a query for the metric you want to create. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT average(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy Edit the query to use one of the three available metric types: summary: Use if the query's function is min, max, sum, count, or average. uniqueCount: Use if the query's function is uniqueCount. distribution: Use if the query's function is percentile or histogram. This example query uses average, so use summary: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary (ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy This example query uses count on a non-numeric field: FROM ProcessSample SELECT count(hostname) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy For summary on a non-numeric field use summary(1): FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(1) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy Tip For more detailed information on using these metric types in rules, see Creating metric rules: requirements and tips. Decide on the attributes you want to attach to the metric, following the limits on the cardinality of unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations. Recommendation: Run a separate query to ensure this count isn't over 50,000 for a 24-hour window. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT uniqueCount(awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy To be able to aggregate and filter your metrics, add the attributes you want to attach to the metric using the FACET clause. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Set the name of the metric using the AS function. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Once your NRQL rule is complete, use it to create the API request. Step 2. Create API request After you build the NRQL rule to convert data from events, logs, or spans to metrics, continue with building the API request. You can use our NerdGraph API tool to explore the data structure and to construct and make your request. To check that the rule was created correctly, you can run a query to return that rule using its ID. For tips on querying the metrics you've created, see Query and chart your metrics. Example NerdGraph API request The following example NerdGraph API request uses the same NRQL rule from step 1. The IO Total Read Bytes Rule creates a metric named io.totalread.bytes. (The rule name can have spaces, which differs from the metric naming rules.) mutation { eventsToMetricsCreateRule(rules: { name: \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", description:\"Created by Zach on March 27, 2019. Used by team Network.\", nrql:\"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\", accountId: 123456 }) { successes { id name nrql enabled } failures { submitted { name nrql accountId } errors { reason description } } } } Copy In this request: Request elements Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsCreateRule The method being called to create a rule. rules Takes four parameters: name: The name of the rule. description: Optional. The description of the rule. We recommend you include information about who created the metric data and who will be using the data. accountId: The New Relic account ID where the events, logs, or spans live and the metrics will be created. nrql: The NRQL query that creates the rule. For more on this, see Create NRQL query. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a successful or failed response. Available parameters for these blocks include: id (ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled (enabled/disabled status) accountId ruleId and accountId If a failure occurs, then the submitted ruleId and accountId will be returned along with the error reason and error description. Example NerdGraph API response Here's an example of a returned response: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsCreateRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"46\", \"name\": \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", \"nrql\": \"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\" } ] } } } Copy Step 3. Create a metrics rule with API request When your API request is ready, you can use the NerdGraph API to make the request, which will create the metrics. Query and chart your metrics After you create a metrics rule to convert data for your events, logs, or spans, you can view the new metric data in the New Relic UI. To view your data: Go to New Relic's NRQL query interface. Run the following query to see the name of all your metrics: SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric Copy Pick the metric of interest, then run the following query to see the available attributes: SELECT * FROM Metric where metricName = 'yourMetric' Copy If you don't see expected data, follow the troubleshooting procedures. The available NRQL aggregator functions depend on the metric type you created. Here are some examples. Summary metric example If you created a summary metric type, you can use the count, sum, max, min, and average aggregator functions, as shown in the following query: SELECT count(appStartResponseTime), sum(appStartResponseTime), max(appStartResponseTime), min(appStartResponseTime), average(appStartResponseTime) FROM Metric Copy Count metric example If you created a uniqueCount metric type, you can only use the uniqueCount function, as shown in the following query: SELECT uniqueCount(playbackErrorStreamUniqueCount) * 100 / uniqueCount(streamUniqueCount) AS '% of Streams Impacted' FROM Metric Copy Distribution metric example If you created a distribution metric type, use the percentile or histogram functions, as shown in the following queries: SELECT percentile(service.responseTime, 95) FROM Metric Copy OR SELECT histogram(service.responseTime, 10, 20) FROM Metric Copy Troubleshooting If your NerdGraph call is not constructed correctly, you may receive a message like this: Cannot parse the unexpected character \"\\u201C” Copy Verify the quotes in the NerdGraph call are not smart quotes (curly quotes). Our NerdGraph API only accepts straight quotes.",

      "body": "You can generate metric-type data from other types of data in New Relic, including events, logs, and spans. Metrics are aggregates of your data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods. This document explains: Reasons to use this feature Available operations How to use our NerdGraph API tool to perform operations Why create metrics from other data types? Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage. This in turn allows you to query your data and build charts more easily. The difference between metrics and other types of data in New Relic is based on time. For more information, see Understand data types. Events, logs, spans: These types of data represent a single record at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your events, logs, or spans. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you can aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this information month over month. Why use metrics? Comments Flexibility Metrics are dimensional. You can choose what metadata (like host name or app name) is attached to them. Common metric measurements, like average, sum, minimum, and maximum, are already calculated. Data aggregation and retention The data has already been pre-aggregated into longer-period time buckets. Data retention is 13 months. Query capabilities You can query using the Metric data type. When you create metrics, this does not delete your events or other types of data. However, metrics are better for longer-range querying and charting. To get started converting your data to metrics, create a rule. Available operations To show, create, and delete rules for generating metrics from events, logs, or spans, use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. These operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing metrics rules). All operations are role-based in NerdGraph as the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics include: Create a rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule The method being called to delete a rule. deletes This takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Example response for the request: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsDeleteRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"id\": \"12\", \"name\": \"Test Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } Copy Enable or disable a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To enable or disable an existing rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics, use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation. The only difference is whether enabled is set to true or false. Example request to enable an existing metrics rule: mutation { eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsUpdateRule The method being called to update an existing rule and either enable it or disable it. updates This takes three required parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. enabled: To enable a disabled rule, set this to true. To disable a rule, set this to false. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Queries Query operations include: List all rules for a New Relic account You can list all rules in a New Relic account or return a specific rule. Example listing all rules for account 123456: query { actor { account(id:123456) { eventsToMetrics{ allRules{ rules{ id name enabled nrql description } } } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description query One of the basic API operation types. Used to query but not make changes. actor This specifies the current New Relic user. account(id: 123456) Specify the ID for the New Relic account where to retrieve data. eventsToMetrics Scope the data only for events-to-metrics, logs-to-metrics, or spans-to-metrics rules. allRules Returns all rules for that account. rules In the rules block, you can define what data you want returned. Available fields include: id name description nrql accountId enabled Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"allRules\": { \"rules\": [ { \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" }, { \"description\": \"Metric for duration\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"Duration Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy List rule by rule ID If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now you want to list its contents so you can review it. Example listing rule 36 for New Relic account 123456: query { actor { account(id: 123456) { eventsToMetrics { rulesById(ruleIds: \"36\") { rules { id name enabled nrql description accountId } } } } } } Copy For more details about the elements in this query, see List all rules. Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"rulesById\": { \"rules\": [ { \"accountId\": 123456, \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"36\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool You can use our GraphiQL tool to explore the data structure. You can also use it to build and run the operations to convert events, logs, and spans to metrics. To use this tool: Create the metrics operation's request with the required parameters. Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql, and paste your query into the box. To execute the operation, press Play. Or, to get the cURL format, select Copy as cURL.) Validate the response in the response box. Optional: To verify that your rule-creation operation was performed successfully, run a list query for that rule ID.",

      "body": "Publish your Nerdpack, whether it's still in development, ready for testing, or stable, to share it with others. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions When you publish your Nerdpack, it's registered with the Instant Observability catalog. From there, some users can subscribe to your Nerdpack. Subscribing users need to have: Access to the account that published the Nerdpack The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Update your package version You can only publish a package version to the Instant Observabiltiy catalog one time. For example, you can't publish two instances of version 1.0.0. So, each time you want to deploy a new version of your code, you need to increment its version in the Nerdpack's package.json file: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy Tip Nerdpack versions follow semantic versioning. Read the documentation to learn more. Generate a UUID for your Nerdpack If you built your Nerdpack from scratch with nr1 create --type nerdpack, then your Nerdpack has a unique identifier. Find this identifier in the root directory's nr1.json file: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"DemoApp\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack demo-app\" } nr1.json Copy This ID must be unique to your Nerdpack when you publish it to the catalog. The platform will reject your Nerdpack if it recognizes the ID. So, if you cloned an existing Nerdpack or are otherwise using open source code, generate a new UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --generate --force Tip Read the nr1 nerdpack:uuid documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --help Publish your Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish If you've successfully published your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This output describes the published Nerdpack. First, it states the Nerdpack's ID (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890). Then, its version (1.0.0). Finally, its version tag (STABLE). You already managed your Nerdpack's ID and version, but the version tag is new. To manage your Nerdpack's versions, you can tag them with an arbitrary tag. For example, if a version is still in development, you can tag it with a DEV tag. If the version moves to a QA phase, you can tag it with QA. If it's ready for production, you can tag it with STABLE. Tip Read our tag guide to learn more. Use the -t or --tag option to publish your Nerdpack with a tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag DEV As you saw in the nr1 nerdpack:publish output, if you don't pass a tag, nr1 applies the STABLE tag automatically. However, you can tell it to not apply any tags to a release with the -T or --skip-tag option: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --skip-tag You can also perform a dry run to make sure you publish your Nerdpack the way you want to: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --dry-run Step 2 of 4 Once you've successfully published your Nerdpack, go to New Relic: Because you're going to view a published Nerdpack, rather than a locally served one, you don't need to pass the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to Instant Observability: Whether you published a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Instant Observability. Step 4 of 4 Find your published Nerdpack using the Apps filter or search bar: Tip Only Nerdpacks with tagged versions are shown in Instant Observability. So, if you published without a tag or removed a tag from your published Nerdpack, you won't see it in the catalog. Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you publish your Nerdpack, you may come across issues. Whether you can't publish your Nerdpack due to some issue with your code or you can't find your Nerdpack in Instant Observability, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your command When you attempt to publish your Nerdpack, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. For example: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack DemoApp (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890) › Error: There is already a Nerdpack with given id & version. › Code: 409 It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --verbose Reveal your published Nerdpack information If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, it may not be tagged. Remember, at least one version of your published Nerdpack must have a tag for it to show on the Apps page. See more information about your published Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:info: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 3014918 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 3 hours ago In this example, there is one published version, but it isn't tagged. You can tag a published version with: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --from-version=1.0.0 --tag=DEV Now, if you refresh your browser page, you should see your Nerdpack on Apps. Tip Read our nr1 nerdpack:tag documentation to learn more. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you publish your Nerdpack, only users who can access your account can see your published Nerdpack. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic but you know it's published, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same.",

Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions To subscribe to a Nerdpack, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can subscribe to them: Publish your Nerdpack Tag your Nerdpack if it's published and doesn't yet have a tag Subscribe to a Nerdpack Subscribe to a published Nerdpack, with either the web UI or the nr1 CLI, to use it in your account. Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Instant Observability: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack using the apps filter or search bar: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the Instant Observability catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel. Tip nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:unset. Read the nr1 subscription:unset documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:unset --help Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you subscribe to a Nerdpack, you may run into issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the Instant Observability catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info AbTest (Nerdpack): description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

Step 3 of 3 View your app in Instant Observability: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application.

Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions To publish your Nerdpack and update its catalog information, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can update their catalog information. Update your Nerdpack's catalog metadata After you've published your Nerdpack to the Instant Observability catalog, update the Nerdpack's metadata to let users know all about your Nerdlets or visualizations. Step 1 of 9 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 9 Navigate to Instant Observability: Step 3 of 9 Find your published Nerdpack using the Apps filter or search bar: Notice that there is no information on the Instant Observability or details page other than the Nerdpack's name and the brief description found in nr1.json: There are no screenshots, icons, details, or what's new features. For these, you need to provide catalog information to your Nerdpack. Step 4 of 9 From the root of your Nerdpack, create catalog directories to house your Nerdpack's screenshots and metadata: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog ✔ created: launchers/launcher/catalog ✔ created: nerdlets/home/catalog ✔ catalog created successfully! catalog is available at \"./catalog\" Inside your root catalog directory, you'll find specific files and directories for portraying information about your Nerdpack to your users: bash Copy $ ls catalog README.md additionalInfo.md config.json documentation.md screenshots File Description README.md A markdown file that instructs you how to use the information and metadata in catalog config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. This cannot exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL for the Nerdpack's remote repository. This cannot exceed 1000 characters. details: The purpose of the Nerdpack and how to use it.

Step 1 of 7 Update the icon.png in the root of your Nerdpack. This icon is used in the catalog and the Nerdpack's detail page. Step 2 of 7 If you're building a Nerdpack with one or more launchers, update the icon.png in each of your launcher's subfolders. Step 3 of 7 Update your package.json version: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.1\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"f2dbc999-e9a3-49b9-933d-5a704c6750bd\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy This allows you to publish a new version of your Nerdpack.

Consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Publish your Nerdpack Remember that you can only submit catalog metadata for Nerdpacks that have already been published. If you try to submit information for a Nerdpack that hasn't been published, the CLI will try to help: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating DemoApp 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the Instant Observability catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info AbTest (Nerdpack): description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

AbTestNerdlet (Nerdlet): displayName: AbTestNerdlet supportedEntityTypes.mode: NONE All the information from catalog shows here. Step 3 of 3 View your app in Instant Observability: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Subscribe to your New Relic One application.",

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Create a Nerdpack, before starting this one. When you build a New Relic One application, it's valuable to view it on the platform. This helps you design, implement, and debug your application in the environment it will eventually be published to. With nr1, you can launch a development server that hosts your application so that New Relic One can present it to you. Step 1 of 4 From inside the Nerdpack's root directory, serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve When the Nerdpack has succeeded building and your application is ready to view, you'll see a message with a link to New Relic One: bash Copy ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! Notice the appended query parameter nerdpacks=local. This query parameter tells New Relic to show locally served Nerdpacks. Tip If you don't see your application on the New Relic platform, make sure you've included nerdpacks=local in your querystring! Step 2 of 4 Navigate to the provided url. From the home page, select Apps to view New Relic One applications: Step 3 of 4 Under the Your apps section, find your launcher, called \"A/B Test Launcher\": Step 4 of 4 Select your launcher to see your root Nerdlet and its default welcome message: Tip Here, you've seen how to access your Nerdlet from a launcher. If you want your Nerdlet closer to your data, you can also attach your Nerdlet to New Relic entities. Congratulations, you've served your first New Relic One application! Notice, in the command's output, that the server reloads when you change files in your Nerdpack.

      "body": "Use New Relic's metrics API service to define rules for creating metrics from your other types of data, such as events, logs, or spans. Recommendation: Before you begin, review our requirements and tips for creating rules. Create a metrics rule To create a rule for creating metrics from events, logs, or spans: Construct the metrics rule using NRQL. Construct a NerdGraph (GraphQL format) API request that contains your NRQL rule. Create the metric by making the API request. Once a metric is created, you can query and chart it using NRQL. Step 1. Create NRQL query rule The most important part of creating a metrics rule is constructing the NRQL query that defines the metric for your data from events, logs, or spans. You can create up to 10 metrics with a single NRQL query by following this procedure: Using New Relic's NRQL interface, construct a query for the metric you want to create. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT average(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy Edit the query to use one of the three available metric types: summary: Use if the query's function is min, max, sum, count, or average. uniqueCount: Use if the query's function is uniqueCount. distribution: Use if the query's function is percentile or histogram. This example query uses average, so use summary: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary (ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy This example query uses count on a non-numeric field: FROM ProcessSample SELECT count(hostname) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy For summary on a non-numeric field use summary(1): FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(1) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy Tip For more detailed information on using these metric types in rules, see Creating metric rules: requirements and tips. Decide on the attributes you want to attach to the metric, following the limits on the cardinality of unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations. Recommendation: Run a separate query to ensure this count isn't over 50,000 for a 24-hour window. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT uniqueCount(awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy To be able to aggregate and filter your metrics, add the attributes you want to attach to the metric using the FACET clause. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Set the name of the metric using the AS function. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Once your NRQL rule is complete, use it to create the API request. Step 2. Create API request After you build the NRQL rule to convert data from events, logs, or spans to metrics, continue with building the API request. You can use our NerdGraph API tool to explore the data structure and to construct and make your request. To check that the rule was created correctly, you can run a query to return that rule using its ID. For tips on querying the metrics you've created, see Query and chart your metrics. Example NerdGraph API request The following example NerdGraph API request uses the same NRQL rule from step 1. The IO Total Read Bytes Rule creates a metric named io.totalread.bytes. (The rule name can have spaces, which differs from the metric naming rules.) mutation { eventsToMetricsCreateRule(rules: { name: \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", description:\"Created by Zach on March 27, 2019. Used by team Network.\", nrql:\"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\", accountId: 123456 }) { successes { id name nrql enabled } failures { submitted { name nrql accountId } errors { reason description } } } } Copy In this request: Request elements Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsCreateRule The method being called to create a rule. rules Takes four parameters: name: The name of the rule. description: Optional. The description of the rule. We recommend you include information about who created the metric data and who will be using the data. accountId: The New Relic account ID where the events, logs, or spans live and the metrics will be created. nrql: The NRQL query that creates the rule. For more on this, see Create NRQL query. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a successful or failed response. Available parameters for these blocks include: id (ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled (enabled/disabled status) accountId ruleId and accountId If a failure occurs, then the submitted ruleId and accountId will be returned along with the error reason and error description. Example NerdGraph API response Here's an example of a returned response: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsCreateRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"46\", \"name\": \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", \"nrql\": \"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\" } ] } } } Copy Step 3. Create a metrics rule with API request When your API request is ready, you can use the NerdGraph API to make the request, which will create the metrics. Query and chart your metrics After you create a metrics rule to convert data for your events, logs, or spans, you can view the new metric data in the New Relic UI. To view your data: Go to New Relic's NRQL query interface. Run the following query to see the name of all your metrics: SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric Copy Pick the metric of interest, then run the following query to see the available attributes: SELECT * FROM Metric where metricName = 'yourMetric' Copy If you don't see expected data, follow the troubleshooting procedures. The available NRQL aggregator functions depend on the metric type you created. Here are some examples. Summary metric example If you created a summary metric type, you can use the count, sum, max, min, and average aggregator functions, as shown in the following query: SELECT count(appStartResponseTime), sum(appStartResponseTime), max(appStartResponseTime), min(appStartResponseTime), average(appStartResponseTime) FROM Metric Copy Count metric example If you created a uniqueCount metric type, you can only use the uniqueCount function, as shown in the following query: SELECT uniqueCount(playbackErrorStreamUniqueCount) * 100 / uniqueCount(streamUniqueCount) AS '% of Streams Impacted' FROM Metric Copy Distribution metric example If you created a distribution metric type, use the percentile or histogram functions, as shown in the following queries: SELECT percentile(service.responseTime, 95) FROM Metric Copy OR SELECT histogram(service.responseTime, 10, 20) FROM Metric Copy Troubleshooting If your NerdGraph call is not constructed correctly, you may receive a message like this: Cannot parse the unexpected character \"\\u201C” Copy Verify the quotes in the NerdGraph call are not smart quotes (curly quotes). Our NerdGraph API only accepts straight quotes.",

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "Publish your Nerdpack, whether it's still in development, ready for testing, or stable, to share it with others. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions When you publish your Nerdpack, it's registered with the Instant Observability catalog. From there, some users can subscribe to your Nerdpack. Subscribing users need to have: Access to the account that published the Nerdpack The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Update your package version You can only publish a package version to the Instant Observabiltiy catalog one time. For example, you can't publish two instances of version 1.0.0. So, each time you want to deploy a new version of your code, you need to increment its version in the Nerdpack's package.json file: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy Tip Nerdpack versions follow semantic versioning. Read the documentation to learn more. Generate a UUID for your Nerdpack If you built your Nerdpack from scratch with nr1 create --type nerdpack, then your Nerdpack has a unique identifier. Find this identifier in the root directory's nr1.json file: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"DemoApp\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack demo-app\" } nr1.json Copy This ID must be unique to your Nerdpack when you publish it to the catalog. The platform will reject your Nerdpack if it recognizes the ID. So, if you cloned an existing Nerdpack or are otherwise using open source code, generate a new UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --generate --force Tip Read the nr1 nerdpack:uuid documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --help Publish your Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish If you've successfully published your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This output describes the published Nerdpack. First, it states the Nerdpack's ID (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890). Then, its version (1.0.0). Finally, its version tag (STABLE). You already managed your Nerdpack's ID and version, but the version tag is new. To manage your Nerdpack's versions, you can tag them with an arbitrary tag. For example, if a version is still in development, you can tag it with a DEV tag. If the version moves to a QA phase, you can tag it with QA. If it's ready for production, you can tag it with STABLE. Tip Read our tag guide to learn more. Use the -t or --tag option to publish your Nerdpack with a tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag DEV As you saw in the nr1 nerdpack:publish output, if you don't pass a tag, nr1 applies the STABLE tag automatically. However, you can tell it to not apply any tags to a release with the -T or --skip-tag option: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --skip-tag You can also perform a dry run to make sure you publish your Nerdpack the way you want to: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --dry-run Step 2 of 4 Once you've successfully published your Nerdpack, go to New Relic: Because you're going to view a published Nerdpack, rather than a locally served one, you don't need to pass the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to Instant Observability: Whether you published a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Instant Observability. Step 4 of 4 Find your published Nerdpack using the Apps filter or search bar: Tip Only Nerdpacks with tagged versions are shown in Instant Observability. So, if you published without a tag or removed a tag from your published Nerdpack, you won't see it in the catalog. Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you publish your Nerdpack, you may come across issues. Whether you can't publish your Nerdpack due to some issue with your code or you can't find your Nerdpack in Instant Observability, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your command When you attempt to publish your Nerdpack, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. For example: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack DemoApp (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890) › Error: There is already a Nerdpack with given id & version. › Code: 409 It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --verbose Reveal your published Nerdpack information If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, it may not be tagged. Remember, at least one version of your published Nerdpack must have a tag for it to show on the Apps page. See more information about your published Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:info: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 3014918 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 3 hours ago In this example, there is one published version, but it isn't tagged. You can tag a published version with: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --from-version=1.0.0 --tag=DEV Now, if you refresh your browser page, you should see your Nerdpack on Apps. Tip Read our nr1 nerdpack:tag documentation to learn more. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you publish your Nerdpack, only users who can access your account can see your published Nerdpack. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic but you know it's published, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same.",

Capabilities at a glance Your ability to manage and use Nerdpacks depends on your user's: Model (original or New Relic One model) Type Role Whether you're on the original user model or the New Relic One user model, review the tables below for a summary of your Nerdpack capabilities. Original user model If your organization was created before July 30, 2020 and you haven't transitioned to our New Relic One pricing model, you're on the original pricing plan. Capabilities for our original user model differ from those of our new user model: Basic user Full user without the Nerdpack Manager add-on role Full user with the Nerdpack Manager add-on role Owner/Admin user Serve Nerdpacks yes yes yes yes Publish Nerdpacks no no yes yes Subscribe to Nerdpacks no no yes yes Tag Nerdpacks no no yes yes Use Nerdlets or visualizations created by your accounts no yes yes yes Use Nerdlets created by New Relic no* yes yes yes Use visualizations created by New Relic no yes yes yes * There are a few Nerdlets that basic users are allowed to use. See Basic users for more information. New Relic One user model If your organization is part of the New Relic One pricing model, the user types, privileges, and capabilities are different than those of our original user model: Basic user Full user Serve Nerdpacks yes yes Publish Nerdpacks no yes Subscribe to Nerdpacks no yes Tag Nerdpacks no yes Use Nerdlets or visualizations created by your accounts no yes Use Nerdlets created by New Relic no* yes Use visualizations created by New Relic no yes * There are a few Nerdlets that basic users are allowed to use. See Basic users for more information. Nerdpack permissions: Original user model Learn the differences between how basic users, full users, and admins can use and manage Nerdpacks in the original user model. Basic users If you're a basic user in the original user model, you're limited in your Nerdpack capabilities. You can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally. To publish, tag, subscribe to, and use your Nerdpacks, an admin must upgrade you to a full user. Tip If you're a basic user, you generally can't use any Nerdpacks. However, there are some Nerdlets that New Relic maintains that you can use. These are rare and there is currently no way for you to distinguish them in our web interface. And even if you can use a Nerdlet in a Nerdpack, you're never able to use custom visualizations. For this, you must be upgraded to a full user. Full users If you're a full user in the original user model, you either: Have the Nerdpack Manager add-on role Don't have the Nerdpack Manager add-on role The Nerdpack Manager role is required to publish, subscribe to, and tag Nerdpacks. So if you don't have the Nerdpack Manager role, you can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally and use Nerdpacks that your accounts have already been subscribed to. To publish, tag, or subscribe to a Nerdpack, an admin must upgrade you to a full user or grant you the Nerdpack Manager add-on role. Owner/Admin users If you're an owner or admin user, you can perform any of the Nerdpack capabilities. You can create, serve, publish, tag, subscribe to, and use any and all Nerdpack items, both Nerdlets and visualizations. This includes Nerdpacks built by New Relic or by one of your accounts. Nerdpack permissions: New Relic One user model Learn the differences between how basic users and full users can use and manage Nerdpacks in the New Relic One user model. Basic users If you're a basic user in the New Relic One user model, you're limited in your Nerdpack capabilities. You can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally. To publish, tag, subscribe to, and use your Nerdpacks, an admin must upgrade you to a full user. Tip If you're a basic user, you generally can't use any Nerdpacks. However, there are some Nerdlets that New Relic maintains that you can use. These are rare and there is currently no way for you to distinguish them in our web interface. And even if you can use a Nerdlet in a Nerdpack, you're never able to use custom visualizations. For this, you must be upgraded to a full user. Full users If you're a full user in the New Relic One user model, you either: Have the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege Don't have the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege The Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege is required to publish, subscribe to, and tag Nerdpacks. So if you don't have the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege, you can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally and use Nerdpacks that your accounts have already been subscribed to. To publish, tag, or subscribe to your Nerdpack, an admin must grant you the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege. Tip The Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege is included in both the User and Admin groups, the only groups available by default. So in most cases, you'll have the ability to manage Nerdpacks as a full user. However, if you're a full user assigned to a custom group that doesn't include the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege, you won't be able to manage Nerdpacks. Master/Sub-account Capabilities Some accounts, called master accounts, have sub-accounts that report data back up to them. This organizational hierarchy affects Nerdpack capabilities. In general, the flow of control moves downstream: In this example scenario A, the master account publishes a Nerdpack. This means that all three accounts, Master, Account 1, and Account 2, can subscribe to it. If you subscribe the master account to the Nerdpack, then users of all three accounts can use it. If you subscribe Account 1 to it, only Account 1 users can use it, because neither Master nor Account 2 is downstream in the hierarchy. In scenario B, the sub-account, Account 1, publishes a Nerdpack, so you can't use or subscribe to the Nerdpack from Master or Account 2.",

Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions When you publish your Nerdpack, it's registered with the Instant Observability catalog. From there, some users can subscribe to your Nerdpack. Subscribing users need to have: Access to the account that published the Nerdpack The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Update your package version You can only publish a package version to the Instant Observabiltiy catalog one time. For example, you can't publish two instances of version 1.0.0. So, each time you want to deploy a new version of your code, you need to increment its version in the Nerdpack's package.json file: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy Tip Nerdpack versions follow semantic versioning. Read the documentation to learn more. Generate a UUID for your Nerdpack If you built your Nerdpack from scratch with nr1 create --type nerdpack, then your Nerdpack has a unique identifier. Find this identifier in the root directory's nr1.json file: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"DemoApp\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack demo-app\" } nr1.json Copy This ID must be unique to your Nerdpack when you publish it to the catalog. The platform will reject your Nerdpack if it recognizes the ID. So, if you cloned an existing Nerdpack or are otherwise using open source code, generate a new UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --generate --force Tip Read the nr1 nerdpack:uuid documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --help Publish your Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish If you've successfully published your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This output describes the published Nerdpack. First, it states the Nerdpack's ID (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890). Then, its version (1.0.0). Finally, its version tag (STABLE). You already managed your Nerdpack's ID and version, but the version tag is new. To manage your Nerdpack's versions, you can tag them with an arbitrary tag. For example, if a version is still in development, you can tag it with a DEV tag. If the version moves to a QA phase, you can tag it with QA. If it's ready for production, you can tag it with STABLE. Tip Read our tag guide to learn more. Use the -t or --tag option to publish your Nerdpack with a tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag DEV As you saw in the nr1 nerdpack:publish output, if you don't pass a tag, nr1 applies the STABLE tag automatically. However, you can tell it to not apply any tags to a release with the -T or --skip-tag option: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --skip-tag You can also perform a dry run to make sure you publish your Nerdpack the way you want to: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --dry-run Step 2 of 4 Once you've successfully published your Nerdpack, go to New Relic: Because you're going to view a published Nerdpack, rather than a locally served one, you don't need to pass the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to Instant Observability: Whether you published a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Instant Observability. Step 4 of 4 Find your published Nerdpack using the Apps filter or search bar: Tip Only Nerdpacks with tagged versions are shown in Instant Observability. So, if you published without a tag or removed a tag from your published Nerdpack, you won't see it in the catalog. Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you publish your Nerdpack, you may come across issues. Whether you can't publish your Nerdpack due to some issue with your code or you can't find your Nerdpack in Instant Observability, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your command When you attempt to publish your Nerdpack, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. For example: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack DemoApp (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890) › Error: There is already a Nerdpack with given id & version. › Code: 409 It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --verbose Reveal your published Nerdpack information If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, it may not be tagged. Remember, at least one version of your published Nerdpack must have a tag for it to show on the Apps page. See more information about your published Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:info: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 3014918 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 3 hours ago In this example, there is one published version, but it isn't tagged. You can tag a published version with: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --from-version=1.0.0 --tag=DEV Now, if you refresh your browser page, you should see your Nerdpack on Apps. Tip Read our nr1 nerdpack:tag documentation to learn more. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you publish your Nerdpack, only users who can access your account can see your published Nerdpack. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic but you know it's published, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add navigation to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you finished the A/B test application you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to prepare it for publication. When you publish your app to the New Relic One catalog, users can view it and subscribe to it. You can help your users by showing and telling them what the app does, how to use it, and more. Create catalog information To supply information to the catalog about your app, you need to create the catalog directory in your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 6 Change to the describe-app/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test Step 2 of 6 Create the catalog directories: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog This creates a root catalog directory with template files for inputting custom information about your app and a catalog directory for each Nerdpack item where screenshots can be stored. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog directory. Step 3 of 6 Update catalog/documentation.md: ## Documentation This application combines and presents data from New Relic and the Nerdsletter API so that we can make an informed decision on which design version results in more high-quality newsletter subscriptions. It also presents an button to end the test, which saves the date and version descriptions in local storage. We can use this app for future A/B tests as well! catalog/documentation.md Copy For this course, you're keeping the documentation concise by merely describing what the app does. In your own projects, you might also include instructions for contributing to the project in an open source context, installing the app's dependencies, or anything else that might help a user navigate complexities in your app or code. Step 4 of 6 Update catalog/config.json: { \"tagline\": \"Win @ newsletter subscriptions\", \"details\": \"Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course\", \"whatsNew\": \"Initial release! Includes:\\n- A variety of charts for understanding the test results\\n- An end test button for storing some test data in a table\", \"support\": { \"email\": { \"address\": \"\" }, \"issues\": { \"url\": \"\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"\" } } } catalog/config.json Copy Here, you've specified a tagline, project details, the source code repository, and a short list of everything included in the initial release. In other projects, you might also add a support email or support links. Step 5 of 6 Save this screenshot to your catalog/screenshots directory. Users will be able to see a carousel of screenshots in your app's About page in the catalog. Step 6 of 6 Save the following icon as icon.png in two places: nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test/launchers/ab-test-launcher This will act as the launcher's icon and the app's catalog icon on the About page. Now you've added documentation, screenshots, metadata, and an icon to your app so that users will be able to understand what it does and why they might need it. For now, these files are all local and they need to be submitted to the catalog. But before you can do that, your app, itself, needs to be published to the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll publish your app, submit your catalog information, and view the results in New Relic.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the Instant Observability catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info AbTest (Nerdpack): description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

Step 3 of 3 View your app in Instant Observability: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application.

In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "Are you already familiar with OpenTelemetry and want to begin the setup? Check out our quick start: Quick start If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can export data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects. New Relic supports all of these signals: traces, metrics, and logs (see details below) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Efficiency OpenTelemetry’s fire-and-forget trace-centric approach to instrumentation often has lower overhead than New Relic agents, especially for asynchronous workloads. It will also result in better handling of trace data for asynchronous requests. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss this with us in our CNCF Slack channel to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start exporting data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our customers. New Relic's APM agents In general, New Relic's APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range of configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. New Relic's APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. The following tables show the supported features for each telemetry signal. If you have questions about these or have an unsupported use case, please contact us in our CNCF Slack channel, and watch this page for future updates. Important New Relic's exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of exporting data to New Relic using OTLP. Traces New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of trace signals. The maturity of the upstream specification is stable. OpenTelemetry traces and spans are compatible with New Relic traces and spans. OpenTelemetry spans optionally include attributes (name-value pairs) and resource attributes which map directly to dimensions that can be used to facet or filter span data at query time. OpenTelemetry span metadata (for example, name, kind, and trace_id) also map directly to dimensions on NewRelic spans. At this time, New Relic does not support span links or array attributes. For details, see the Traces section of our best practices guide. Feature Supported Span events ✅ Span linking ❌ Array of primitives (homogeneous) ❌ Metrics New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of metric signals. Note that the maturity of the upstream specification is experimental. We intend to follow potentially breaking upstream changes. Here are the OpenTelemetry data types we support and their associated mappings. For details, see the Metrics section of our best practices guide. Metric Type Supported Delta sums ✅ Cumulative sums ✅ Gauges ✅ Delta histograms ✅ Summary ✅ Cumulative histograms ❌ Exemplars ❌ Array of primitives (homogeneous) ❌ Logs New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of log signals. Note that the maturity of the upstream specification is experimental. We intend to follow potentially breaking upstream changes. OpenTelemetry logs are compatible with New Relic logs. OpenTelemetry logs optionally include attributes (name-value pairs) and resource attributes which map directly to dimensions that can be used to facet or filter log data at query time. OpenTelemetry log metadata (for example, name, severity_text, and trace_id) also map directly to dimensions on New Relic logs. NewRelic currently supports all OpenTelemetry log message types except for arrays. For more details, see the Logs section of our best practices guide. Feature Supported Description LogRecord body ✅ Supported types: string, boolean, int, double, bytes LogRecord attributes ✅ Supported types: string, boolean, int, double, bytes LogRecord fields ✅ Examples: name, severity_text, trace_id Array messages ❌ Array attributes ❌ Next steps Follow the OpenTelemetry quick start to help you get started.

      "body": "When system performance suffers, you need to know if it’s due to your code, your infrastructure, or the underlying network. And you need to know fast, so you can focus your efforts. With Network Performance Monitoring you can correlate and analyze application, infrastructure, digital experience, and network data all in one place, and understand how network performance and overall system performance impact each other. Using Navigator with Network Performance Monitoring. Network Performance Monitoring adds the context of network data to the application and infrastructure data you already collect in New Relic One. By monitoring your network data, you can: Analyze and understand the performance of your entire stack (application and infrastructure) for a holistic understanding of your system performance. Have all the data in a single platform to eliminate blind spots. See at first glance whether a network is implicated in an issue. Sign up for free! No credit card required. Already have an account? Login. Types of network performance data You can monitor the following types of network performance data: SNMP data: Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an application–layer protocol for exchanging management information between network devices. To send SNMP data to New Relic One, see Set up SNMP data monitoring. Network flow data: It captures information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your on-premises network. To send network flow data to New Relic One, see Set up network flow data monitoring. Important We recommend configuring both SNMP and network flow data for better visibility into your network. This will provide both performance metrics and traffic patterns to troubleshoot and optimize your network. High level architecture overview Our solution is based on the ktranslate docker container developed by our partner, Kentik. This single container image is hosted in your environment to collect and process your data to be exported to the Event, Metric, and Log APIs and displayed in New Relic One.

Here's how to configure network flow data collection in some devices: NetFlow data Palo Alto - PAN-OS Fortinet Fortigate Cisco - NX-OS Cisco - IOS Cisco - Meraki sFlow data F5 - BIG-IP jFlow data Juniper - Junos Network security prerequisites Direction Source Destination Ports Protocol Outbound Docker host ktranslate image on Docker Hub 443 TCP Outbound Docker host New Relic Event API US Endpoint: https://insights-collector.newrelic.com EU Endpoint: https://insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net 443 TCP Outbound Docker host New Relic Log API US Endpoint: https://log-api.newrelic.com EU Endpoint: https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com 443 TCP Inbound Source devices for network flow data Docker host 9995 (default) UDP Supported types of network flow data NPM flow monitoring supports the four primary types of network flow data and their derivatives. When running the ktranslate container, you will specify which major type you want to monitor using the -nf.source option. Important The ktranslate container only supports monitoring one type of network flow data type at a time. If you want to monitor several types, each will require a container. IPFIX and NetFlow v9 can be sent to the same container, but we recommend running a separate container as a best practice. Network flow data type -nf.source value IPFIX ipfix NetFlow v5 netflow5 NetFlow v9 netflow9 sFlow sflow AppFlow netflow5 Argus netflow5 cflowd netflow5 J-Flow netflow5 NetStream netflow5 RFlow netflow5 Cisco NSEL netflow9 Scaling network flow collection When planning your strategy for collecting network flows at scale, New Relic recommends 1 CPU per 2000 flows-per-second (120,000 flows-per-minute). Deciding whether to run more small containers to distribute load or fewer large containers to consolidate management is a matter of personal preference. Set up network flow data monitoring in New Relic One Go to one.newrelic.com and click Add more data. Scroll down until you see Network performance monitoring and click Network Flows. Follow the steps in New Relic One. one.newrelic.com > Add more data > Network performance monitoring > Network Flows to set up network flow data monitoring. To get better visibility into your network device performance, set up SNMP data monitoring. Visualize your network performance data in New Relic. Manual setup If you prefer to do the setup manually, proceed with the following steps. In your local machine, from a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id In the snmp-base.yaml file, add your network flow devices inside the devices key with the following structure: devices: flowDevice: device_name: edge-router device_ip: 10.10.1.254 flow_only: true # Optional user tags user_tags: owning_team: net_eng environment: production Copy Tip If you're already monitoring SNMP data devices that send network flow data, you don't need to add them in your snmp-base.yaml file a second time. Run ktranslate to listen for network flows by running: Tip Add your New Relic license key and your account ID in the $NR_LICENSE_KEY and $NR_ACCOUNT_ID variables respectively. bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -flow_only=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > nr1.flow $ ## If your account is located in Europe, you need to add the following option before the nr1.flow line $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ Tip This command assumes collection of sflow data. If you are collecting other flow types, you should change the suffix in the --name flag for the container and update the -nf.source argument as necessary To get better visibility into your network device performance, set up SNMP data monitoring.

The flow_only attribute on both a ktranslate docker container level and in the devices section of the snmp-base.yaml file allows you to get different results: If you have multiple containers collecting both SNMP and network flow data with the ktranslate docker image, define your devices in the snmp-base.yaml file, following the standards for SNMP data polling. They will be automatically matched to their respective flows based on their device_ip matching the sampling IP for the flow device. For network flow data devices, run the ktranslate docker image with the -flow_only=true option. snmp-base.yaml file - No setting changes needed If you have multiple containers collecting both SNMP and network flow data with the ktranslate docker image, and you have specific devices where you only want network flow or SNMP data collection and no SNMP or network flow data polling respectively, you can set them up in their respective device configuration section in the snmp-base.yaml file. For network flow data devices, run the ktranslate docker image with the -flow_only=true option. snmp-base.yaml file - Change the flow_only to true: flow_only: true Copy Advanced options for running the ktranslate docker image In this table you can find additional options you can use with the ktranslate docker image. Option name Description -max_threads Lets you process higher volumes of flow. We recommend one CPU core available for every 2,000 flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent. -sample_rate=100 Changes the default sample rate value at which flows are passed to New Relic One Events. It also sets the sample rate value for flow types that don't have a default sample rate value. -nf.workers=1 Overrides the number of workers used in processing udp packets. Use one worker for every 4,000 of flows per second (fps) of network flow data sent. -nf.port Overrides the default 9995 listening port for incoming flow packets. -listen Overrides the default 8082 port used by ktranslate to expose health metrics. You must use this option when running multiple ktranslate containers on a single host. -metalisten Overrides the default 8083 port used by ktranslate to expose metadata. You must use this option when running multiple ktranslate containers on a single host. -metrics=jchf Forwards health metrics from ktranslate into New Relic One. -log_level Overrides the default info log level for ktranslate. The available options are debug, info, warn, or error. -tee_logs Forwards logs from ktranslate into New Relic One Logs. HTTPS_PROXY Environment variable that can be used during Docker runtime to setup ktranslate to ship data to New Relic via proxy. Ex: -e HTTPS_PROXY=https://user:password@hostname:port You can also run several ktranslate images to monitor different network flow types simultaneously. See the follwing example: bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --net=host \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$INSERT_API_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > -nf.port=9996 \\ > -max_threads=1 \\ > -listen 0.0.0.0:8084 \\ > -metalisten 0.0.0.0:8085 \\ > nr1.flow $ $ $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-netflow9 --net=host \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$INSERT_API_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -nf.source=netflow9 \\ > -nf.port=2055 \\ > -max_threads=2 \\ > -listen 0.0.0.0:8086 \\ > -metalisten 0.0.0.0:8087 \\ > nr1.flow Logs sent with Network performance monitoring If you want to check the logs locally, run docker logs ktranslate-snmp. The -tee_logs=true option sends logs to New Relic One when polling devices. To see them, do the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. In Find logs where enter collector.name:\"ktranslate\" and click Query logs. Tip If you want to filter out all the information messages, enter collector.name:\"ktranslate\" message:-*\\[Info\\]*. Metrics sent with Network performance monitoring The -metrics option captures one of the following performance metrics when polling devices: Metric Description baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total Rate of internal health checks. Shows mostly that things are not deadlocked. delivery_metrics_nr Rate of metrics sent to New Relic One. delivery_logs_nr Rate of logs sent to New Relic One. delivery_wins_nr Rate of 200 HTTP codes received from sending metrics and events to New Relic One. device_metrics Rate of SNMP polling of device level metrics. inputq Messages per second (msg/sec) recieved over the last 60 seconds from SNMP or network flow devices. interface_metrics Rate of SNMP polling of interface level metrics. jchfq Gauge rate with number of available pre-allocated buffers. It should be 8,000 aproximately. To see these metrics in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data. Enter the following NRQL query: FROM Metric SELECT latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total) AS 'baseserver_healthcheck_execution_total', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.delivery_metrics_nr) AS 'delivery_metrics_nr', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.delivery_logs_nr) AS 'delivery_logs_nr', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.delivery_wins_nr) AS 'delivery_wins_nr', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.device_metrics) AS 'device_metrics', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.inputq) AS 'inputq', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.interface_metrics) AS 'interface_metrics', latest(kentik.ktranslate.chf.kkc.jchfq) AS 'jchfq' WHERE provider = 'kentik-agent' AND instrumentation.name = 'heartbeat' LIMIT MAX Copy",

Before you build a quickstart, you need to spin up a docker container. The container consists of two important services: A python program that mimics the database and also provides functions for create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. It also makes use of newrelic_telemetry_sdk to send telemetry data to New Relic. A simulator service that generates dummy database traffic so you don't have to manually perform CRUD operations To spin up these services, you first need to set NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY environment variable. Prepare your environment On your local machine, set your license key in an environment variable: bash Copy $ export NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY=<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Your mock database uses this key to write telemetry data to New Relic. You can find your New Relic license key in your account settings. Spin up demo services Clone the lab repository from GitHub: bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/build-a-quickstart-lab.git This repository contains the code for Flashdb as well as the simulator for dummy database traffic. Navigate to the demo directory and execute the following commands to build and run docker image: bash Copy $ docker build -t flashdb . $ docker run -e NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY=$NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY flashdb Here, you build and run docker image that generates mock database traffic.

If you haven't already, checkout the lab introduction Each procedure in this lab builds on top of the last one, so make sure you Create a dashboard before proceeding with this one. With New Relic alerts, you can monitor your services and receive notifications about problems that you're interested in, so you can react fast to troubleshoot and resolve them. Tip It is assumed that you are already familiar with the alerts basics. If you're just getting started, visit the alert documentation to familiarize yourself with the basics before proceeding. Create an alert policy Before you set alert conditions, you must create a policy. From Alert & AI, go to the Alerts section and click Policies from left-hand navigation. Then, click New alert policy. Name your policy FlashDB alert policy. Use the default values for the rest of the fields and click Create alert policy. The next step is to add conditions to the alert policy. Create alert conditions You're going to add the following alert conditions: slow read responses low cache hit ratio Create a high response time alert condition Under FlashDB alert policy, click Create a condition. The next page asks you to choose a category for your condition. Choose NRQL, which allows you to create a condition using a NRQL query. Then, click Next, define thresholds. You want New Relic to notify you if the read operation is taking longer than expected. Name your alert condition \"slow read responses\" and enter the following NRQL query for your condition. SELECT average(fdb_read_responses) FROM Metric Copy Here, you selected the average read response for FlashDB. Scroll down on the same page to define threshold. Select Static as the threshold type. It is the simplest threshold type and creates a condition based on the numeric value returned by the query. Set the critical threshold value at 0.9: Here, you defined a condition that will open violation whenever read response time is above 0.9 for at least 5 minutes. Next, click Add warning threshold. Enter the threshold value at 0.8 to get a warning when the read response is above 0.8 for at least 5 minutes. Then, click Save condition. Now, You can see your new condition under your FlashDB alert policy. Create a cache hit ratio condition You claimed that your database is fastest in the space, so you also want New Relic to notify you if your cache hit ratio is too low. Add another condition under the same policy by clicking Add a condition. The next page asks you to choose the category for your condition. Choose NRQL and click Next, define threshold. Enter the name \"Low cache hit ratio\" for your condition and use the following NRQL query. SELECT sum(fdb_cache_hits)/sum(fdb_read_responses) FROM Metric Copy Next, add threshold values for critical violation and warning. The procedure is same as before. The only difference is that you want New Relic to notify you if the query returns a value below 0.85 and open a critical violation if the value falls below 0.75 for at least 5 minutes. Save the condition to add it to your alert policy which now looks like the following. Add a notification channel To receive notifications for any opened violations, you also need to add a notification channel. First, move to the Notification channels tab and click Add notification channels. From the list of channel options, click Email. Select the email you want to receive your notifications on, and click Update policy. Notification channel is now added. Summary During this procedure, you created FlashDB alert policy and added slow read responses and low cache hit ratio conditions to it. You also added a notification channel to receive notifications about any opened violations. Lab This procedure is a part of lab that teaches you how to build a quickstart.

      "body": "Our APM agents and mobile agents have limits on the number of events that can be reported. This document explains: Why event-reporting limits are necessary How sampling works How to work with and understand sampled data Difference between events and metrics This document is about limits on event data and how those limits lead to sampling. First, it may help you to understand the differences between these two types of data: Metrics: aggregated measurements over time. Examples: average response time over a one-minute time range, throughput over time, CPU utilization over time. Events: discrete events that happen at a specific moment in time. Examples: a log or error being reported, or a configuration change. Some events are aggregated over time to form metrics (for example: a count of errors over time). These two types of data have different uses: metrics are useful for recognizing patterns over time in your system, and events are useful for drilling down and getting detail about the causes of those patterns. Because metrics are aggregated over time, they’re useful for spotting trends and changes in system behavior. For metrics that represent an aggregated count of events (like an HTTP response time metric), the individual events give you granular detail about what happened, and let you facet by attributes that have high cardinality (like account or user ID). Why sampling of events is necessary Our APM agents and mobile agents have limits on how many events can be reported per harvest cycle. This is necessary because if there were no limit, a very large number of events being sent could have performance impacts on your application or on New Relic. When the limit is reached, the agents begin sampling events. Different agents have different limits, but the goal is to give a representative sample from across the harvest cycle. Also, agents may sample if they can't connect to New Relic. When an agent can’t connect to New Relic, it continues to store data locally. But it must restrict the size of the payload that is eventually sent. For this reason, it samples events during the disconnected period. The longer it is disconnected, the more it will sample. The impact of sampling One result of sampling is that there can be a discrepancy between unsampled metric data and sampled event data. Examples of this: An APM chart showing unsampled metric data may show you higher throughput than an equivalent NRQL query of sampled event data. For more about the difference between our metric timeslice data and event data, see Data types. A non-New Relic monitoring service may show different results from New Relic. Events that are capped and subject to sampling include: Transaction TransactionError Span (see Distributed tracing sampling) Custom events reported via agent API (example: the .NET agent's RecordCustomEvent) Mobile MobileRequest MobileCrash MobileHandledException Important For APM, you can compensate for sampling when querying data. Change how sampling occurs Before attempting to change how sampling occurs, please read these caveats and recommendations: Reporting more events will result in the agent using more memory. There will usually be a way for you to get the data you need without raising an agent's event-reporting limit. The payload size limit is 1MB (10^6 bytes) (compressed), so the number of events may still be affected by that limit. To determine if events are being dropped, see the agent log for a 413 HTTP status message. Here are some ways to impact sampling: Most agents have configuration options for changing the limit on sampled transactions (examples: Java agent’s max_samples_stored or the Android mobile agent’s setMaxEventPoolSize). If it’s important to you that a specific app activity not be sampled, you can use the Event API. You could deploy your application across a greater number of instances. Because the limits are per-agent, more agents will mean a larger event reservoir. APM: Compensate for sampling When querying APM-reported events, you can compensate for sampling by using EXTRAPOLATE. This will give you an approximation of what unsampled data looks like.",

      "body": "Proper instrumentation gives teams full visibility into the impact of the changes they make in a system. Capturing tangible, measurable metrics from before and after each change allows teams to optimize changes in isolation and reduce the impact to other work happening in the system. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, complete the Establish objectives and baselines. 1. Integrate measurements into your development process With appropriate measurements incorporated into all phases of your development cycle, you can surface errors and performance issues before your customers uncover them. As your application teams plan their work, use your KPI dashboards in daily stand-ups and other planning meetings to analyze necessary debugging work, assess whether recent deployments were successful, and prioritize other work efforts. When development and operations teams use dashboards during planning and discussions, they ensure that they're consistently incorporating feedback about customer experiences and reliability risks into their development efforts. For proper testing, ensure that instrumentation in your pre-production environments is in parity with your production environments. Use dashboards to compare the environments and verify that the code and infrastructure changes you make across them are correct, and eliminate any anomalies before pushing code to production. Beyond using instrumentation to measure software performance, also use it to analyze team efficiency. For example, with your alerts data, use NRQL and external integrations to calculate mean time to repair (MTTR) by subtracting the difference in event timestamps as the current state of each event changes from OPEN to ACKNOWLEDGED to CLOSED. Or push events into Insights from a source code management (SCM) system like GitHub, and calculate the amount of time it takes a code change to go live by comparing the timestamp of a commit event to that of a deploy event. Plotted over time, this could become a KPI in a DevOps transformation. 2. Add automated deployment markers It's important to track deployments and the impact code and infrastructure changes have on your end-user experience. Using deployment markers in APM, you can record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened, and it's paired with metadata available from your SCM system (for example, the user, revision, or change-log). APM displays a vertical line, or “marker,” on charts and graphs at the deployment event's timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview APM also provides a chronological list of deployments of your application. Additional metrics, such as error rate and Apdex from the time of the deployment, are available as well. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Deployments Tracking deployments is a valuable way to determine the root cause of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your application. New Relic recommends that you make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate this: Chef (see newrelic_deployment) Jenkins Ansible Puppet 3. Test your pipeline with Infrastructure An important part of optimizing your cloud native environment is a making a cultural shift toward smaller, more frequent changes to your code and infrastructure. After you complete the first two steps of this tutorial, begin to test and gather appropriate performance insights about your deployment pipeline to more clearly understand the impact of the changes you make. Code changes should be as small as possible in terms of the number of lines of code and source files you change. Changes should also involve as few team members as possible. This makes it much easier to identify issue owners and determine root causes if errors occur. Similarly, infrastructure changes should also have as small a footprint as possible to minimize the number of applications affected by each change. New Relic Infrastructure helps you see when an infrastructure change has caused a spike in issues, as shown in the following example: one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts For cloud infrastructure changes or larger code changes, consider using a blue/green deployment strategy. APM supports multiple app names, which is a good fit for this model. To implement this strategy: Deploy a version of your application to existing infrastructure using a rollup app name that signifies it as the “blue” version (or control version). Deploy a new version of your application to a subset of the infrastructure (or an alternate set of infrastructure) with a rollup name that signifies this as the “green” version (or experimental version). Ensure that traffic is routed appropriately between both versions. Compare established KPI dashboards of both versions against one another. Optimize the new version accordingly to meet your KPI targets. When you're satisfied with the application's performance, deploy the new version across your infrastructure using the original app name, and consider this the new baseline for any future changes you'll make to the application.",

With New Relic alerts, you can monitor your services and receive notifications about problems that you're interested in, so you can react fast to troubleshoot and resolve them. Tip It is assumed that you are already familiar with the alerts basics. If you're just getting started, visit the alert documentation to familiarize yourself with the basics before proceeding. Create an alert policy Before you set alert conditions, you must create a policy. From Alert & AI, go to the Alerts section and click Policies from left-hand navigation. Then, click New alert policy. Name your policy FlashDB alert policy. Use the default values for the rest of the fields and click Create alert policy. The next step is to add conditions to the alert policy. Create alert conditions You're going to add the following alert conditions: slow read responses low cache hit ratio Create a high response time alert condition Under FlashDB alert policy, click Create a condition. The next page asks you to choose a category for your condition. Choose NRQL, which allows you to create a condition using a NRQL query. Then, click Next, define thresholds. You want New Relic to notify you if the read operation is taking longer than expected. Name your alert condition \"slow read responses\" and enter the following NRQL query for your condition. SELECT average(fdb_read_responses) FROM Metric Copy Here, you selected the average read response for FlashDB. Scroll down on the same page to define threshold. Select Static as the threshold type. It is the simplest threshold type and creates a condition based on the numeric value returned by the query. Set the critical threshold value at 0.9: Here, you defined a condition that will open violation whenever read response time is above 0.9 for at least 5 minutes. Next, click Add warning threshold. Enter the threshold value at 0.8 to get a warning when the read response is above 0.8 for at least 5 minutes. Then, click Save condition. Now, You can see your new condition under your FlashDB alert policy. Create a cache hit ratio condition You claimed that your database is fastest in the space, so you also want New Relic to notify you if your cache hit ratio is too low. Add another condition under the same policy by clicking Add a condition. The next page asks you to choose the category for your condition. Choose NRQL and click Next, define threshold. Enter the name \"Low cache hit ratio\" for your condition and use the following NRQL query. SELECT sum(fdb_cache_hits)/sum(fdb_read_responses) FROM Metric Copy Next, add threshold values for critical violation and warning. The procedure is same as before. The only difference is that you want New Relic to notify you if the query returns a value below 0.85 and open a critical violation if the value falls below 0.75 for at least 5 minutes. Save the condition to add it to your alert policy which now looks like the following. Add a notification channel To receive notifications for any opened violations, you also need to add a notification channel. First, move to the Notification channels tab and click Add notification channels. From the list of channel options, click Email. Select the email you want to receive your notifications on, and click Update policy. Notification channel is now added. Summary During this procedure, you created FlashDB alert policy and added slow read responses and low cache hit ratio conditions to it. You also added a notification channel to receive notifications about any opened violations. Lab This procedure is a part of lab that teaches you how to build a quickstart.

Doc Quickstart for Kafka monitoring Kafka monitoring is important to track services running on multiple Kafka servers in real-time. Observe key metrics like CPU usage, memory, and consumer lag at a glance in a Kafka dashboard. Why monitoring kafka is so important Apache Kafka is a fault-tolerant, scalable messaging system used to build real-time data pipelines. Kafka also supports replications natively, and you can build streaming applications that run inside production environments. Leveraging a Kafka monitoring tool to monitor data replication, retention, and issues like consumer lag is important. New Relic’s Kafka quickstart lets you look at performance metrics and inventory data, create your own custom charts and queries, and create alert policies. New Relic Kafka quickstart features New Relic’s Kafka monitoring tracks space and time retention, leverages replication alerts to uncover potential issues, and uses queries and a Kafka dashboard to explore them. New Relic + Kafka quickstart New Relic’s performance monitoring provides instant observability out-of-the-box. This quickstart includes: Monitoring Kafka topics Dashboards tracking brokers, messages per sec, broker bytes in and out per sec, consumer lag, and more Monitoring of producers and consumers coded in Java New Relic - complete Kafka monitoring Provide total visibility into key performance metrics like the number of client requests and bytes served per second with New Relic’s Kafka monitoring and also track inventory data and metadata in real-time. One of the key features of New Relic’s Kafka monitoring is that you can configure your retention settings by time and by space and set up real-time alerts. Track key metrics like gauge, count, and summary as well with New Relic’s instant observability quickstart. Ensure that your infrastructure remains robust and running while averting potential data loss by monitoring Kafka brokers and Kafka producers. Kafka quickstart contains 1 dashboard .

      "body": "New Relic has resource limits in place to protect your experience, our systems, and our other customers. These limits range from the maximum number of characters you can have in a query, to API request rates, to how many events your queries inspect, and more. This page describes the limit metrics and NrIntegrationError events that enable you to view your limits, your current data usage and overall resource consumption as compared to those limits, and the impact of experiencing a limit event. We also provide a handful of queries that, when compiled into a dashboard, can give you consistent insight into your limits status. Important While NrIntegrationError events provide data on many limits types, resource limit metrics currently only cover request rate ingestion and API query rate limits. What happens when you reach a limit Our response to reaching a limit depends on a handful of factors: the type of limit that’s reached, as well as the duration, frequency, and amount at which you exceed the limit. Exceeding a limit doesn’t always mean you experience a limit event, such as dropped data, rejected traffic, or having your data turned off for the rest of the day. We sometimes allow a small buffer before enforcing a limit. That said, any resource consumed above 100% is at risk for limit impact at any time. Many of our rate limits apply proportionally. That means if you’re barely exceeding the limit, we will take less action than if you're exceeding by 200%. Limit metrics are only visible if you're sending data in to a corresponding dataType or limitName API. For example, if you send in data via the Metric API, you’ll see the Metric API resource metrics, but if you don't send any APM data in, you won't see APM resource metrics. Tip Impact metrics will be generated regardless of impact; if there's no impact, you’ll see a 0. An NrIntegrationError event is generated when you experience impact and is a good way to quickly see if you’re experiencing any limit events. See View System Limits for more information. Create a dashboard to view your limit status Using three limit metrics together on a dashboard, you can quickly see detailed visuals of your Ingest Resource Request Per Minute limits, and with NrIntegrationError get a view into more limits. Dashboard displaying limits status using a handful of queries. We used the following queries to create this dashboard. To make a dashboard like this in New Relic One, select Dashboards, and then Create a dashboard. Then, add a new chart for each query you want to regularly monitor. The three limits metrics included in these queries are described in a separate section, below. From left to right, top to bottom: Resource Consumption Limits as a % FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) /latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Max % Consumption in an hour SELECT max(`usage`) FROM (FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 as 'usage' facet limitName timeseries ) facet limitName limit max Copy APM Agent API transaction events request per minute FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) where limitName = 'APM Agent API transaction events requests per minute' TIMESERIES Copy Trace API With limit line FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) as 'usage', latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) as 'limit' where limitName = 'Trace API requests per minute' TIMESERIES Copy Impact FACET From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource TIMESERIES 1 minute limit max Copy NrIntegrationError by limit FROM NrIntegrationError select count(*) facet limitName TIMESERIES MAX since 1 day ago limit max Copy Multi-Account limits (on time series charts only) If you want to see limits for multiple accounts on one chart: run this query from one of the accounts: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName, consumingAccountId where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Click Add another query. Select a different account. Then run this query again: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName, consumingAccountId where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Finally, save it. Limit list and NrIntegrationError FROM Metric, NrIntegrationError select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) as 'Per Minute Count',latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) as ' limit Value',(rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue)*100)as 'Percent Used', filter (count(*), where NrIntegrationError.limitValue is not null) as 'limit reached count' facet limitName limit 1000 Copy Limit metrics These metrics, used in the dashboard queries above, can hone in on a single limit or resource. Or, with the help of FACET limitName or resource provide a view across all your limits. newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue limitValue allows you to see the setting for a limit by limitName and understand more about what resource is linked to this limit. The following examples use the limit value metric in the query: Example for Metric API requests per minute. FROM Metric select latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) where limitName = 'Metric API requests per minute' Copy To show all limits, add FACET limitName and consider grouping by limitTimeInterval. FROM Metric select latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) WHERE limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' FACET limitName limit max Copy newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue currentValue shows you how much of a given resource you’re currently consuming. To get a better glimpse into how our systems are viewing your consumption, use a rate() function with the time period that aligns with the limitTimeInterval. Limit 200. Example for Metric API request per minute: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue),1 minute) where limitName = 'Metric API requests per minute' Copy To show all limits, add FACET limitName and consider grouping by limitTimeInterval. FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue),1 minute) where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' FACET limitName limit max Copy newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact impact lets you know for any given resource what impact limit events are having. Zeros mean you are not currently impacted. The most granular we have is dataType. It is possible for multiple instances of limitName to impact a single type, such as Metric RPM and DPM. If we know, we will display limitName. From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, resource, impact, limitName TIMESERIES limit max Copy Metric attributes Attributes on newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue and newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue: limitName - The Name of the limit for the metric data, i.e RPM Metric API. dataType - What kind of data the metric is tracking, i.e Metric, Log, or APM. Resource - What resource is being consumed, i.e. Requests, or DPM. limitTimeInterval - What time window this resource is evaluated for limiting. consumingAccountId - The New Relic account where the resource is being consumed. Attributes on newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact dataType - The kind of data that is being impacted, i.e Metric, Log, APM. Resource - What resource is being impacted, i.e Request Rate. Impact - A count of what is happening when resource has exceeded set limit, i.e dropped requests. consumingAccountId - The New Relic account where the resource is being consumed. Set alerts on resource metrics While building a dashboard to see all your limits is handy, being able to automate it is even better. You can set alerts on your limit metrics to provide updates on limits changes. Tip Because we currently only have metrics on 1 minute time windows, setting TimeWindow = 1 minute, will cover them all. Eventually, we make more metrics available, you might want to set separate alerts for limits that are enforced by different time windows. You can use the following NRQL queries to create alerts. Learn about creating alerts with NRQL queries here. Limits faceted by LimitName and scoped by Timewindow From Metric select (rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue))*100 facet limitName Copy Alert on a single limit From Metric select (rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue))*100 where limitName = 'my limit' Copy Alert on limit impact faceted by dataType, impact, resource, and reason From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource, reason Copy Alert on impact of a single dataType From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource, reason WHERE dataType = 'important things' Copy",

      "body": "The Insights Dashboard API is deprecated, but you can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to create and configure dashboards. If you're not migrating from the old Insights API, you can skip this doc and go to the new Dashboards API. Why a new dashboards API? Our Insights product, which was a way to query data and create charts and dashboards, has been deprecated and its set of features moved over to be a core part of the New Relic One platform. To learn more about this transition and new features, see the Insights to New Relic One migration guide. The Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated in July of 2021. Until then, if you're using the Insights Dashboard API, you should attempt to switch over to using NerdGraph. (The Insights query API will not be deprecated but NerdGraph is preferred.) Keep reading to learn how to get started with NerdGraph and learn about equivalent operations. Get started with NerdGraph NerdGraph is the preferred API for making NRQL queries of your New Relic data. Every user who uses NerdGraph needs their own user key. When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. If you're new to NerdGraph and GraphQL, you may want to first read our Introduction to NerdGraph and some of Create dashboards with NerdGraph.

By using the NerdGraph API explorer, you can discover GraphQL types and fields, along with a brief explanation. We want to facilitate your migration from the Insights API to the new New Relic One dashboards API. Find below some examples that illustrate how the old REST endpoints map to the new GraphQL queries or mutations. List (GET) -> entitySearch query Dashboards in New Relic One embrace the concept of entity. They are now another entity in New Relic’s entity ecosystem. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. List all dashboard entities you have access to { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by name { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {name: \"My dashboard\"}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s email { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD, tags: {key: \"createdBy\", value: \"email@domain.com\"}}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s user id { actor { entitySearch(query: \"type ='DASHBOARD' and ownerId = '2357322'\") { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy Show (GET) -> entity query In order to get information on a dashboard, all you need is to provide its unique entity identifier or entity guid. Then you can access all the dashboard properties that you are interested in by adding them in the GraphQL query. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Get dashboard info given its entity guid { actor { entity(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { ... on DashboardEntity { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } } Copy Create (POST) -> dashboardCreate mutation Operations that mutate the state of the system are mutations in GraphQL APIs. You can create a dashboard by providing the required input for the dashboardCreate mutation. Although GraphQL APIs aim to be self-explanatory, Nerdgraph docs can help you with some information about the fields, like the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Create dashboard with two pages and two widgets per page mutation { dashboardCreate(accountId: 1, dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.markdown\" }, title: \"My markdown widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { text: \"#My markdown\" } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.billboard\" }, title: \"My billboard widget with thresholds\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" }], thresholds: [{ alertSeverity: WARNING, value: 650 }, { alertSeverity: CRITICAL, value: 1500 }] } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Update (PUT) -> dashboardUpdate mutation The dashboardUpdate mutation allows you to update an existing dashboard by providing the existing dashboard guid and the new configuration. Similarly to creating a dashboard, the mutation tries to be self-explanatory, but you can look up the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer.

Starting out with NerdGraph If you're new to NerdGraph and GraphQL, you may want to first read our Introduction to NerdGraph. If you’re already familiar with the dashboards API, you can read Create dashboards with NerdGraph. When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. Find the NerdGraph API explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Operations We have defined a granular GraphQL API that lets you execute different dashboard operations depending on their goal and scope. Dashboard CRUD operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes actor > entity() query Get dashboard operation. You can get all dashboard and widget data for a given dashboard entity GUID. dashboardCreate() mutation Create dashboard operation. You can create a dashboard attached to a specific account by specifying all its elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardUpdate() mutation Update dashboard operation. You can update an existing dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. You need to specify the complete, updated dashboard elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardDelete() mutation Delete dashboard operation. You can delete an existing dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. This operation executes a logical delete that lets you recover your dashboard. dashboardUndelete() mutation Undelete dashboard operation. You can recover a previously deleted dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. Dashboard page operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes dashboardUpdatePage() mutation Update dashboard page operation. You can update one page of an existing dashboard given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the complete, updated dashboard page elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardUpdateWidgetsInPage() mutation Update widgets operation. You can update a set of existing widgets of a dashboard page given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the set of widgets to be updated and their complete configuration. dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() mutation Add widgets operation. You can add a set of new widgets to a dashboard page given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the set of new widgets and their complete configuration. Other operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes dashboardCreateSnapshotUrl() mutation Create dashboard page snapshot operation. You can create a public URL for a given dashboard page entity GUID. The dashboard page can then be accessed in the form of a static snapshot in the resulting public URL. actor > dashboard > liveUrls() query List all live URLs operation. You can get the complete list of live URLs you have access to. A live URL is a mechanism that allows you to share dashboard pages and widgets publicly with up-to-date or live data. dashboardWidgetRevokeLiveUrl() mutation Revoke widget live URL operation. You can revoke a previously created live URL of a widget. As a result, the live URL will become unavailable to the public. Limits We have limited the values you can set to some of the dashboard properties. This allows us to keep dashboards in good shape while boosting their usability. Dashboard limits Limit Value Maximum number of pages in a dashboard 20 Maximum length of a dashboard name 255 Maximum length of a dashboard description 1024 Dashboard page limits Limit Value Maximum number of widgets in a dashboard page 100 Maximum length of a dashboard page name 255 Maximum length of a dashboard page description 1024 Widget limits Limit Value Maximum length of a widget title 255 Maximum number of entities linked to a widget 1 Maximum number of queries in a widget 20 Maximum layout column of a widget 12 Minimum layout column of a widget 1 Minimum layout row of a widget 1 Maximum layout width of a widget 12 Minimum layout width of a widget 1 Maximum layout height of a widget 32 Minimum layout height of a widget 1 Errors as first class citizens All dashboard mutations offer a way to ask for errors when being executed. This means that you can perform your dashboard mutations and check the response in order to detect expected potential issues. Every error has a type and a description to help you identify what’s the source of the problem. Errors as part of every mutation response mutation { dashboardMutation(guid: \"MY_EXISTING_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { mutationResult { result } errors { description type } } } Copy Keep in mind that these are expected errors that we are aware of in advance. You should also check for unexpected errors that will be returned in the standard GraphQL errors field.",

      "body": "Envision your data as a complex system of roads: you need to navigate the signs and signals along the way to quickly see and make meaning of the information you collect. New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. View dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see Data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. Transitioning from Insights Switching to using New Relic One dashboards from our deprecated Insights dashboards? See our transition guide. If you're using the Insights Dashboard API, we have have a migration guide that will help you transition to using the new API. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By duplicating an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Duplicate a dashboard Duplicate any dashboard by clicking the Duplicate dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can duplicate any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the duplicate will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your duplicated dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can duplicate it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. Everything but the metadata is hidden. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by duplicating another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

      "body": "Extensive log data can help you troubleshoot issues. But what if an attribute in your log contains thousands of characters? How much of this data can New Relic store? And how can you find useful information in all this data? How blobs work For lengthy string values that are longer than can be stored in NRDB (4,094 characters), we store the long string in three pieces: Long log sections Description First 4,094 characters The first 4,094 characters are stored in Log event field with the same name. So a long message value would have its first 4,094 characters stored in a message field. Next 128,000 UTF-8 bytes The next 128,000 UTF-8 bytes of the string are stored in a blob field with the name with newrelic.ext. prepended. So a long message value would have characters past the first 4,094 characters stored in a newrelic.ext.message field as a blob. The actual number of characters stored depends on the UTF-8 representation of the characters. UTF-8 represents Unicode characters as one to four bytes, so we will store anywhere between 32,000 and 128,000 characters past the first 4,094 characters. Remaining characters Any characters past 4,094 characters plus 128,000 bytes are dropped and not stored. So the long message field would be stored as: message: <first 4,094 characters as a string> newrelic.ext.message: <next 128,000 bytes as a 'blob'> Copy Tip You can search the first 4,094 characters of a string attribute. You can also create alerts for the first 4,094 characters. However, since 'blob' storage is not searchable, text beyond the first 4,094 characters is not searchable or alertable. Query your data for blobs To query for any log data in New Relic, run the following query: SELECT * FROM Log Copy To expand the blob data, run the following query, using message or any other attribute. Be sure to enclose the blob's attribute with backticks. For example: SELECT message, another-attribute, blob(`newrelic.ext.message`), blob(`newrelic.ext.another-attribute) FROM Log Copy To query extended blob data in your logs, be sure to include backticks in your attribute's blob syntax. This expands the data in the blob so you can see (but not search) it. For example, New Relic returns: { \"message\": <first 4,094 characters> \"newrelic.ext.message\": <the next 128,000 bytes as Base64> \"another-attribute\": <first 4,094 characters> \"newrelic.ext.another-attribute\": <the next 128,000 bytes as Base64> } Copy The Logs UI automatically stitches the original value back together when looking at the Log Detail View. When querying using NRQL directly, you need to manually stitch the information together by: Decoding the Base64 of the newrelic.ext. attribute value Converting the resulting UTF-8 into a string Appending that string to the first 4,094 characters in the \"main\" attribute Data retention for long logs NRDB retains your blob records for a month. If you have existing long log messages stored as LogExtendedRecord, that data will also continue to be available for a month in NRDB. After a month passes, no more new LogExtendedRecord attributes will be created. They will all be stored in NRDB as blobs.",

Now, you want to help users of FlashDB to quickly and easily observe it in New Relic. To achieve your goal, contribute a quickstart to New Relic I/O so other users can quickly monitor FlashDB. Why quickstarts? With New Relic you can collect, monitor, and report data from different sources. You can use dashboards to view, explore, customize, understand, and correlate the data you collect using different user-friendly charts. You can also set alert policies to monitor key performance metrics and receive notifications for anomalies. Traditionally, FlashDB users would have to spend crucial development hours creating dashboards, alerts, and other entities to monitor their database. But with quickstarts, you can do that work for them. Quickstarts provide immediate value for your specific use case. They include: Clear instructions for instrumenting your services Observbility building blocks like dashboards and alerts All of this is available through an open ecosystem where New Relic developers, partners, and customers contribute their best-practice solutions.

      "body": "If you’ve been reading our documentation, chances are you’ve already learned a bit about New Relic and the many tools and capabilities we offer. We’re very proud of the utility and design of our dashboards, alerts, and versatile programmability, but none of it would be possible without the computing power needed to make it all run smoothly. Just like a finely calibrated race car, what you see on the outside may be the most exciting features, and these are the parts you interact with to “drive.” But without an engine designed to win, elegant instrument panels, a responsive clutch, and a great paint job won’t get you anywhere. Under the hood of New Relic lies the engine powering it all: the New Relic Database (NRDB). In this resource, we explain how NRDB helps you succeed in your observability goals. Billions of data points per minute New Relic ingests billions of telemetry data points every minute, serving more than 180,000 accounts simultaneously. To run such a high-volume platform, the underlying database and query capabilities need to be fast, flexible, and scalable. They must also be equally effective for organizations of all sizes, supporting a wide spectrum of telemetry needs and business goals. NRDB provides the power, speed, and scalability you need to monitor your performance across your entire landscape quickly and effectively. Scale, purpose, and equal access to resources To meet the challenging demands for speed, efficiency, scalability, and reliability, we built NRDB with three key objectives. Unlimited scalability: Hosted in the cloud, NRDB's distributed architecture has the capacity for virtually unlimited scale. Monitoring and analysis: With this dual purpose in mind, NRDB handles operational monitoring and data analytics equally well. This means that NRDB can ingest massive amounts of data while also giving you real-time alerting, lightning-fast queries, and charting — all without sacrificing speed. Resources when you need them: As a multi-tenant system supporting tens of thousands of customers, NRDB gives you the resources you need when you need them (which single-tenant systems cannot match). The lifecycle of a query NRDB returns results for queries of all sizes astonishingly fast. To do this, we use parallel processing at massive scale. This architectural approach is equally effective for accelerating a single large query and for allowing numerous users to run small queries simultaneously without impacting speed. It works like this: A user enters a query using one of our tools, such as the query builder, or a dashboard or other type of instrumentation sends an automated query. NRDB starts by sending the query to a router, which in turn sends the query components to hundreds or even thousands of query workers. The query workers find the data, and the process is repeated in reverse, with data returning to populate dashboards, create alerts, or answer discrete queries, among other things. This process yields complete query results in a fraction of the time that other methods would require. To further improve efficiency, NRDB also caches recent queries, allowing it to send those results back to users nearly instantaneously. The result: flexibility, speed, accuracy, and efficiency How big is the difference? Because of NDRB's raw power and purposeful design, New Relic's telemetry products are able to analyze tens of billions of events per second while maintaining a median query response time of 45 milliseconds. We would say, “Your query results are just a heartbeat away,” but mathematically that’s more like a tenth of a heartbeat (unless you’re a mouse). What do these statistics mean for our customers? At the end of the day, NRDB's speed and unique capabilities enable you to identify, analyze, and fix performance problems much faster, reducing downtime so you can get back to business. What’s next? Want to know more? Here are a few recommendations for what to do next: Learn about NRDB's data model and flexible schema in our blog post and white paper. Get to know NRQL, our query language, with our Syntax, clauses, and functions page, or read about some of our favorite NRQL capabilities. Read about our query builder, which supports NRQL and PromQL-style queries. Check out UI options for dashboards and charting.",

Setting up Prometheus is straightforward, but scaling up and managing is not. That’s where New Relic steps in. New Relic's Prometheus quickstart New Relic offers two Prometheus integration schemes, Remote Write and OpenMetrics. Remote Write is ideal for well-established Prometheus infrastructures. It provides easy access to your metrics and only takes one line of yaml in your configuration for access. OpenMetrics allows for more visibility across multiple container platforms. Once the integration is set up, you can query data on memory usage for pods in deployment, facet any metrics, and view raw metric values all in one place. New Relic's Prometheus Integration stores various kinds of telemetry data - whether open-source, vendor-specific, or vendor-agnostic. Value of the Prometheus quickstart New Relic’s quickstart makes DevOps easier. Although there are many ways to use Prometheus data in New Relic, we’ll break these down into OpenMetrics and Remote Write to help you decide on the best option for you: Use pre-built dashboards to monitor Kubernetes HPA capacity, or build your own! Monitor node readiness, and create alerts to let you know if a node is having issues and should not accept workloads Automatically instrument and monitor any OpenMetrics endpoint.

Once your metrics are in New Relic, you can query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Want to try out our StatsD integration? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements This integration uses our Metric API and our Event API to ingest data. To use these APIs, you'll need a license key. The integration adheres to the Metric API requirements and data limits. The default rate limit is 100,000 data points per minute (DPM). If you think you're missing metrics or sending more than 100K DPM, see Request data changes. To see if your account is hitting the rate limit, run the following NRQL query of the NrIntegrationError event: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' FACET category, message LIMIT 100 since 1 day ago Copy Install This section will explain how to do a standard install. If you want to run StatsD in Kubernetes, see Kubernetes install. To install the StatsD integration, run the following command and include your New Relic account ID and New Relic license key. This generates a TOML configuration file used by gostatsd. docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy If your account is in the EU data center region, add this to the above command: -e NR_EU_REGION=true \\ Copy After installing, you can: Do optional additional configuration Define your metrics Add custom tags to your data Create alerts Install for Kubernetes Here are examples of Kubernetes manifests for deployment and service objects: Kubernetes manifest examples Below are examples of Kubernetes manifests to deploy StatsD in a Kubernetes environment and create a StatsD service named newrelic-statsd. You need to insert your account ID and your license key. deployment.yml: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: selector: matchLabels: app: newrelic-statsd replicas: 2 revisionHistoryLimit: 2 template: metadata: labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: containers: - name: newrelic-statsd image: newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 env: - name: NR_ACCOUNT_ID value: \"NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID\" - name: NR_API_KEY value: \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy service.yml: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: newrelic-statsd port: 80 targetPort: 8125 protocol: UDP selector: app: newrelic-statsd Copy For configuration details, see Kubernetes configuration. Configure In the install procedure, you run nri-statsd with environment variables, and this generates a TOML configuration file. Additionally, you can set these configuration options: Configuration options Description expiry-interval string If a metric is not updated for this amount of time, we stop reporting that metric. Default is 5m. If you want to send the metrics only if the value was updated between the flush intervals, configure this to 1ms. To never expire metrics, set it to 0. percent-threshold list of integers Specifies the percentiles used for metrics aggregation. Default: 90. metrics-addr string Indicates address on which to listen for metrics. Default: :8125. Tip To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the StatsD integration you must define the following endpoints in the custom configuration: address = 'https://gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/ $NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' Copy address-metrics = 'https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' Copy Here are some examples of customizing configuration by overwriting the default configuration: Example of custom configuration # Specify after how long do we expire metrics, default:5m expiry-interval = '1ms' # percent-threshold specify a list of percentiles for metrics aggregation, default:90 percent-threshold = [90, 99] backends='newrelic' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY' Copy Disable timer sub-metrics: By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. If you want to disable those metrics you can do it by adding a disabled-sub-metrics configuration section and set true for the ones you want disabled. Here's an example: # disabled-sub-metrics configuration section allows disabling timer sub-metrics [disabled-sub-metrics] # Regular metrics count=false count-per-second=false mean=false median=false lower=false upper=false stddev=false sum=false sum-squares=false # Percentile metrics count-pct=false mean-pct=false sum-pct=false sum-squares-pct=false lower-pct=false upper-pct=false Copy Docker: overwrite default configuration To overwrite the default nri-statsd configuration while running in a container, you can mount a configuration file inside the container. You can adopt the following template as needed for your situation. Example: backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY' Copy To run the container with the file mounted in the appropriate path: docker run \\ ... -v ${PWD}/nri-statsd.toml:/etc/opt/newrelic/nri-statsd.toml \\ ... newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Kubernetes: overwrite default configuration The best approach to configure nri-statsd running in Kubernetes is to use a configMap and mount the configMap into the container. (This is a similar process to mounting the configuration file in Docker.) Example: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-statsd-config namespace: default data: nri-statsd.toml: | backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = '$NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY' Copy To use the configMap, declare a volume on your deployment spec template and then declare a volumeMount on your container spec. Example: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment spec: template: spec: containers: .... volumeMounts: - mountPath: /etc/opt/newrelic/ name: nri-statsd-config volumes: - name: nri-statsd-config configMap: name: nri-statsd-config Copy Metric format The integration receives metrics using the StatsD protocol. Optionally, the sample rate can be configured and tags can be added. Here's the metric data format we use: <metric name>:<value>|<type>|@<sample rate>|#<tags> Copy Here are explanations of these fields: Field name Description < metric name> string Required. Name of the metric. < value> string Required. The metric type: c = counter g = gauge ms = timer @ < sample rate> float Optional for simple counters or timer counters. When many metrics must be sent, you can use sampling to reduce network traffic. The downside is a reduction in the resolution of the data. An example of how this would work for sample rates below 1: If you set this to 0.1, the counter would send a measurement one out of every 10 times. # < tags> string Optional. Tags attached to your metrics are converted into attributes (key-value pairs). For more on tagging options, see Tags. Metric types Here are the types of metrics and how to format them: Counter A counter measures the number of occurrences of an event. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. A counter can be incremented or decremented during the same flush interval by adding a sign to the value. In the following example, the counter value will be 2: counter:4|c counter:-2|c Copy At each flush, the current count is sent and reset to 0. If the count is not updated, at the next flush it will send the value 0. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Here’s an example of a counter that is being sampled 1 out of 10 times: counter:4|c@0.1 Copy Gauge A gauge represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include temperature, CPU usage, and memory. Here's an example: temperature:40|g Copy If the gauge is not updated, at the next flush it will send the previous value. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Timer The timer metric type measures timing data. By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. These are sent as sub-metrics in the following format: <metric_base_name>.std_dev <metric_base_name>.median <metric_base_name>.summary <metric_base_name>.sum_squares <metric_base_name>.mean <metric_base_name>.per_second Copy The configured percentiles will generate the following metrics. The percentile threshold value will be attached as a tag. <metric_base_name>.sum_squares.percentiles <metric_base_name>.sum.percentiles <metric_base_name>.count.percentiles <metric_base_name>.upper.percentiles <metric_base_name>.mean.percentiles Copy The percentile threshold can be tweaked with the percent-threshold config option. These can be controlled through the disabled-sub-metrics configuration section. Add tags (attributes) You can add tags to your data, which we save as attributes (key-value pairs). There are two options for adding tags: Add default tags that apply to all metrics: These apply to all metrics. They are fixed and don't change over time. Add metric-level tags: These apply to specific metrics and allow the value to be changed between two submits. Add default tags that apply to all metrics Add tags to metrics and events by defining an environment variable in the startup command. Here's an example that would create two tags: -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" Copy Here's that environment variable used in the startup command: docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Add metric-level tags When defining the metric format, you can add tags using this format: <bucket name>:<value>|<type>|#<tags> Copy In this example, <tags> is a comma-separated list of tags. Tags format is: simple or key:value. Here's an example NRQL query that includes a custom tag: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE environment = 'production' Copy Create alerts You can alert on StatsD data using NRQL alert conditions. Alert example This procedure walks you through sending some sample data and then creating an alert condition using that data. First, send this data to New Relic’s StatsD container: echo \"prod.test.num:32|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Next, create a NRQL alert condition using this query: SELECT latest(prod.test.num) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'prod.test.num' Copy Here's an image showing creating this NRQL alert condition. Notice that the sample data sent in is represented by the blue dot on the upper right of the chart. Now we can create the alert condition with these settings: When you create the NRQL alert condition, be sure to set the Condition name. If a metric with a value above 50 is sent, then an incident is created and notified. The incident is closed automatically after 24 hours. To test that the alert is working, run this command: echo \"prod.test.num:60|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Find and use data To query your data, you'd use any New Relic query option. For example, you might run a NRQL query like: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'myMetric' and environment = 'production' Copy For more on how to query the Metric data type, see Query metric data.

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Tip Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",
