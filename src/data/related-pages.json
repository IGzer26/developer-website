      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: allows you to configure your Nerdlet and write to your Nerdlet's URL state.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Fetch data from a third-party service, before starting this one. In this course, you're building a New Relic One application. This application shows telemetry data from a demo service that is running an A/B test so that it can reveal that data in charts, like a dashboard. Your New Relic application is different than a dashboard, however, because it does more than show New Relic data. It pulls external data, provides UI components and functionality, and even has its own small data stores. The purpose of this New Relic application is to present context so you can better understand the A/B test results and how those results tie in to your business objectives. So far, you've built all your charts, organized them for improved usability, provided them with real data, and more. There are some final improvements you can make, using Platform API components. In this lesson, you learn how to use values in the New Relic platform state. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-platform-state-context/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, add a PlatformStateContext.Consumer to your NewsletterSignups component's render() method: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Notice that NrqlQuery uses a constant called ACCOUNT_ID. Instead of hardcoding an account identifier in your Nerdlet, you can use accountId from the platform URL state. Step 3 of 10 PlatformStateContext.Consumer provides access to the platform's URL state. This context contains an important value you'll use in your app, called timeRange. Notice that your NrqlQuery uses a SINCE clause that identifies the historical timeframe your query should fetch data from. Right now, that SINCE clause is set to 30 MINUTES AGO. With timeRange, you can use the platform's time picker to make this timeframe adjustable. Step 4 of 10 Utilize the platform state's timeRange: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, NewsletterSignups uses platformState.timeRange instead of a hardcoded SINCE clause. While NrqlQuery components accept a convenient timeRange prop, not every component does. You can still use timeRange in other contexts by accessing duration, begin_time, or end_time: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { console.log(platformState.timeRange.duration); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>; Copy Step 5 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test. Step 6 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 7 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 10 View your application: Your NrqlQuery now uses the platform state's timeRange, but your chart probably still shows the last 30 minutes. Why? Where does the timeRange in platform state come from? The time picker sits on the right side of your application's navigation bar: Change this value and see your chart update: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 9 of 10 Update VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Of all the charts in your New Relic One application, these three charts are the ones that should update with the time picker. The others, Total subscriptions per version, Total cancellations per version, Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions, Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, show total values over time. So, hardcoding their SINCE clauses to 7 DAYS AGO makes sense, as this is a reasonable time period for the purposes of this course. Step 10 of 10 While still serving your Nerdpack locally, view your NR1 app to see your charts updating with the time range you choose: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now that you're basing your queries off the platform state, some of your charts are dynamic in their time ranges. This is a great improvement because it allows you to adjust your charts to show data from any particular point in time, which is useful for tying data to business outcomes. The Platform API components offer a lot more functionality, too, including the ability to navigate the user to another place in New Relic. You'll learn how to do this in the next lesson. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Add navigation to your nerdlet.",

      "body": "Access the New Relic platform from the comfort of your terminal. You can use the New Relic CLI to manage entity tags, define workloads, record deployment markers, and much more. In short, you can use the CLI to automate common tasks in your DevOps workflow. This guide walks you through the essentials of New Relic CLI, from install and configuration to basic usage. Before you begin For this guide you just need: Your New Relic user key. An instrumented application in your New Relic account. Step 1 of 10 Install the New Relic CLI Download the New Relic CLI for your operating system, as described below. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Using Snapcraft, run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Using Homebrew, run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Using Scoop, run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 10 Create your New Relic CLI profile. After you install the New Relic CLI, it's time to create your first profile. Profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command, which is useful when switching between accounts. Run the profiles add command: bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY -r YOUR_REGION $ # Set the profile as defaults $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Important You must set the region of your New Relic account. Use -r to set either us or eu. Step 3 of 10 Get your application details. Now, add tags to the application you've instrumented with New Relic. Tags are key-value pairs that can help you organize and filter your entities. An entity (for example, an application) can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. Before searching for your application using the New Relic CLI, write down or copy your Account ID and the name of your application in New Relic - you need both to find applications in the New Relic platform. Step 4 of 10 Retrieve your application details as a JSON object. To search for your APM application, use the apm application search command: bash Copy $ newrelic apm application search --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID --name NAME_OF_YOUR_APP Tip If you get an error, check that your account ID and application name are correct. Step 5 of 10 Find the guid value. If the account ID is valid, and the application name exists in your account, apm application search yields data similar to this example: [ { \"accountId\": YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, \"applicationId\": YOUR_APP_ID, \"domain\": \"APM\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"A_LONG_GUID\", \"name\": \"NAME_OF_YOUR_APP\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/A_LONG_GUID\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" } ] Copy When you've successfully searched for your application, look for the guid value. It's a unique identifier for your application. You should copy it or write it down. Step 6 of 10 Add a simple tag to your application. Now that you have the GUID, you can point the New Relic CLI directly at your application. Adding a tag is the simplest way to try out the CLI capabilities (don't worry, tags can be deleted by using entity tags delete). Here, you add an environment tag to your application. Add the dev:testing tag⁠ (or any other key-value pair) to your application using the entities tags create command: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag devkit:testing Step 7 of 10 Add tag sets. What if you want to add multiple tags? Tag sets to the rescue! While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 To add multiple tags to your application at once, modify and run this snippet: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: this means it could take a while for the tags to get created. Step 8 of 10 Retrieve your application's tags. You've created and added some tags to your application, but to test that they're working, you need to retrieve them. Run the entity tags get command: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags get --guid YOUR_APP_GUID All tags associated with your application are retrieved as a JSON array: [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Step 9 of 10 Bonus step: create a deployment marker. Deployments of applications often go wrong. Deployment markers are labels that, when attached to your application data, help you track deployments and troubleshoot what happened. To create a deployment marker, run the apm deployment create command using the same application ID from your earlier search: bash Copy $ newrelic apm deployment create --applicationId YOUR_APP_ID --revision $(git describe --tags --always) Step 10 of 10 Check the JSON response for the revision and timestamp of the deployment. You can build this workflow into a continuous integration or continuous deployment (CI/CD) system to indicate changes in your application's behavior after deployments. Here's an example: { \"id\": 37075986, \"links\": { \"application\": 204261368 }, \"revision\": \"v1.2.4\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-03-04T15:11:44-08:00\", \"user\": \"Developer Toolkit Test Account\" } Copy Next steps Have a look at all the available commands in the New Relic CLI. For example, you can create a New Relic workflow using workload create If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you easily get StatsD-format data into New Relic. You can also add any arbitrary tags (key-value pairs) to your data. Once your metrics are in New Relic, you can query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Requirements This integration uses our Metric API and our Event API to ingest data. To use these APIs, you'll need an Insert API key. The integration adheres to the Metric API requirements and data limits. The default rate limit is 100,000 data points per minute (DPM). If you think you're missing metrics or sending more than 100K DPM, see Request data changes. To see if your account is hitting the rate limit, run the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' FACET category, message LIMIT 100 since 1 day ago Copy Install This section will explain how to do a standard install. If you want to run StatsD in Kubernetes, see Kubernetes install. To install the StatsD integration, run the following command and include your New Relic account ID and New Relic Insert API key. This generates a TOML configuration file used by gostatsd. docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy If your account is in the EU data center region, add this to the above command: -e NR_EU_REGION=true \\ Copy After installing, you can: Do optional additional configuration Define your metrics Add custom tags to your data Create alerts Install for Kubernetes Here are examples of Kubernetes manifests for deployment and service objects: Kubernetes manifest examples Below are examples of Kubernetes manifests to deploy StatsD in a Kubernetes environment and create a StatsD service named newrelic-statsd. You need to insert your account ID and your license key. deployment.yml: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: selector: matchLabels: app: newrelic-statsd replicas: 2 revisionHistoryLimit: 2 template: metadata: labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: containers: - name: newrelic-statsd image: newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 env: - name: NR_ACCOUNT_ID value: \"NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID\" - name: NR_API_KEY value: \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy service.yml: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: newrelic-statsd port: 80 targetPort: 8125 protocol: UDP selector: app: newrelic-statsd Copy For configuration details, see Kubernetes configuration. Configure In the install procedure, you run nri-statsd with environment variables, and this generates a TOML configuration file. Additionally, you can set these configuration options: Configuration options Description expiry-interval string If a metric is not updated for this amount of time, we stop reporting that metric. Default is 5m. If you want to send the metrics only if the value was updated between the flush intervals, configure this to 1ms. To never expire metrics, set it to 0. percent-threshold list of integers Specifies the percentiles used for metrics aggregation. Default: 90. metrics-addr string Indicates address on which to listen for metrics. Default: :8125. Tip To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the StatsD integration you must define the following endpoints in the custom configuration: address = 'https://gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/ $NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' Copy address-metrics = 'https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' Copy Here are some examples of customizing configuration by overwriting the default configuration: Example of custom configuration # Specify after how long do we expire metrics, default:5m expiry-interval = '1ms' # percent-threshold specify a list of percentiles for metrics aggregation, default:90 percent-threshold = [90, 99] backends='newrelic' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy Disable timer sub-metrics: By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. If you want to disable those metrics you can do it by adding a disabled-sub-metrics configuration section and set true for the ones you want disabled. Here's an example: # disabled-sub-metrics configuration section allows disabling timer sub-metrics [disabled-sub-metrics] # Regular metrics count=false count-per-second=false mean=false median=false lower=false upper=false stddev=false sum=false sum-squares=false # Percentile metrics count-pct=false mean-pct=false sum-pct=false sum-squares-pct=false lower-pct=false upper-pct=false Copy Docker: overwrite default configuration To overwrite the default nri-statsd configuration while running in a container, you can mount a configuration file inside the container. You can adopt the following template as needed for your situation. Example: backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To run the container with the file mounted in the appropriate path: docker run \\ ... -v ${PWD}/nri-statsd.toml:/etc/opt/newrelic/nri-statsd.toml \\ ... newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Kubernetes: overwrite default configuration The best approach to configure nri-statsd running in Kubernetes is to use a configMap and mount the configMap into the container. (This is a similar process to mounting the configuration file in Docker.) Example: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-statsd-config namespace: default data: nri-statsd.toml: | backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = '$NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To use the configMap, declare a volume on your deployment spec template and then declare a volumeMount on your container spec. Example: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment spec: template: spec: containers: .... volumeMounts: - mountPath: /etc/opt/newrelic/ name: nri-statsd-config volumes: - name: nri-statsd-config configMap: name: nri-statsd-config Copy Metric format The integration receives metrics using the StatsD protocol. Optionally, the sample rate can be configured and tags can be added. Here's the metric data format we use: <metric name>:<value>|<type>|@<sample rate>|#<tags> Copy Here are explanations of these fields: Field name Description < metric name> string Required. Name of the metric. < value> string Required. The metric type: c = counter g = gauge ms = timer @ < sample rate> float Optional for simple counters or timer counters. When many metrics must be sent, you can use sampling to reduce network traffic. The downside is a reduction in the resolution of the data. An example of how this would work for sample rates below 1: If you set this to 0.1, the counter would send a measurement one out of every 10 times. # < tags> string Optional. Tags attached to your metrics are converted into attributes (key-value pairs). For more on tagging options, see Tags. Metric types Here are the types of metrics and how to format them: Counter A counter measures the number of occurrences of an event. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. A counter can be incremented or decremented during the same flush interval by adding a sign to the value. In the following example, the counter value will be 2: counter:4|c counter:-2|c Copy At each flush, the current count is sent and reset to 0. If the count is not updated, at the next flush it will send the value 0. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Here’s an example of a counter that is being sampled 1 out of 10 times: counter:4|c@0.1 Copy Gauge A gauge represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include temperature, CPU usage, and memory. Here's an example: temperature:40|g Copy If the gauge is not updated, at the next flush it will send the previous value. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Timer The timer metric type measures timing data. By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. These are sent as sub-metrics in the following format: <metric_base_name>.std_dev <metric_base_name>.median <metric_base_name>.summary <metric_base_name>.sum_squares <metric_base_name>.mean <metric_base_name>.per_second Copy The configured percentiles will generate the following metrics. The percentile threshold value will be attached as a tag. <metric_base_name>.sum_squares.percentiles <metric_base_name>.sum.percentiles <metric_base_name>.count.percentiles <metric_base_name>.upper.percentiles <metric_base_name>.mean.percentiles Copy The percentile threshold can be tweaked with the percent-threshold config option. These can be controlled through the disabled-sub-metrics configuration section. Add tags (attributes) You can add tags to your data, which we save as attributes (key-value pairs). There are two options for adding tags: Add default tags that apply to all metrics: These apply to all metrics. They are fixed and don't change over time. Add metric-level tags: These apply to specific metrics and allow the value to be changed between two submits. Add default tags that apply to all metrics Add tags to metrics and events by defining an environment variable in the startup command. Here's an example that would create two tags: -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" Copy Here's that environment variable used in the startup command: docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Add metric-level tags When defining the metric format, you can add tags using this format: <bucket name>:<value>|<type>|#<tags> Copy In this example, <tags> is a comma-separated list of tags. Tags format is: simple or key:value. Here's an example NRQL query that includes a custom tag: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE environment = 'production' Copy Create alerts You can alert on StatsD data using NRQL alert conditions. Alert example This procedure walks you through sending some sample data and then creating an alert condition using that data. First, send this data to New Relic’s StatsD container: echo \"prod.test.num:32|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Next, create a NRQL alert condition using this query: SELECT latest(prod.test.num) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'prod.test.num' Copy Here's an image showing creating this NRQL alert condition. Notice that the sample data sent in is represented by the blue dot on the upper right of the chart. Now we can create the alert condition with these settings: When you create the NRQL alert condition, be sure to set the Condition name. If a metric with a value above 50 is sent, then an incident is created and notified. The incident is closed automatically after 24 hours. To test that the alert is working, run this command: echo \"prod.test.num:60|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Find and use data To query your data, you'd use any New Relic query option. For example, you might run a NRQL query like: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'myMetric' and environment = 'production' Copy For more on how to query the Metric data type, see Query metric data.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version If you already had the CLI, update it: bash Copy $ nr1 update Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start. You’re ready to build an application with the New Relic One CLI! Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default mobile monitoring events using the mobile agent SDKs. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the crash event trail UI. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams. Be sure to follow your organization's obligations for notices and consent regulations.",

Make this call before the window load event fires (when that data is transmitted) in order for the attributes to be included in the PageView event. Once an attribute is set, New Relic One records it with all PageAction events until the page is reloaded or the attribute is manually unset. If you are using SPA monitoring with a compatible agent version, attributes set with this call will also be included in newrelic.interaction events. However, attributes set using the SPA API will take precedence over these attributes. Errors for custom attributes will be included in events on the JS Errors page.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. Terragrunt is a thin wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state. In this guide, you will use Terragrunt to generate your Terraform configurations, create files with Terragrunt, and reuse the Terragrunt configuration to manage multiple environments. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic Infrastructure agent for your host. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: You will also need to install Terragrunt to follow this guide: bash Copy $ brew install terragrunt To follow the examples in this guide, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 6 Create a new configuration Terragrunt is a wrapper that provides extra tooling for your Terraform configurations. In the next steps, you will create a new configuration using Terragrunt, Terraform, and New Relic. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terragrunt-config && cd terragrunt-config In the new directory, create a terragrunt.hcl file, create a ./src directory, and create a ./environments directory: bash Copy $ touch terragrunt.hcl $ mkdir src $ mkdir environments Inside of your environments folder, create a folder named dev. In the ./src directory, create a main.tf and provider.tf files: bash Copy $ mkdir environments/dev $ touch src/main.tf $ touch src/provider.tf In the provider.tf file add the appropriate Terraform and New Relic provider configuration information: terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } Copy In the main.tf add a New Relic alert policy named DemoPolicy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Copy In the ./environments/dev directory create a new file named terragrunt.hcl bash Copy $ cd ./environments/dev/ $ touch terragrunt.hcl Within the dev folder update the terragrunt.hcl file by adding the following include statement. The include statement tells Terragrunt to use any .hcl confgiuration files it finds in parent folders. include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } Copy Next, add a Terraform block to provide Terragrunt with a Terraform source reference. terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Now you need to configure the provider with your New Relic account details. You will need your New Relic user API key and account ID. provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you have a single account: The account ID is displayed on the API keys page. If your organization has multiple accounts: From one.newrelic.com, select Entity explorer and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page. Tip Documentation about the New Relic provider is provided on the Terraform doc site. Update the provider.tf file to define the New Relic account variables that will help keep the Terraform configuration dynamic. variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy In your terminal, change directories to the environments/dev folder and run the command terragrunt init: bash Copy $ terragrunt init Terraform init sets up a bit of context, sets up environment variables, and then runs terraform init. You will see the following output: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Exit the terragrunt plan process with CTRL+C . In the environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl file, add an inputs block to provide the values for your New Relic account variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy The updated terragrunt.hcl only has the include, terraform, and inputs block include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Now, when you run terragrunt plan, Terragrunt will provide the input block's values, no longer prompting the command line for values. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Run terragrunt apply. After Terraform finishes process, check your New Relic account for the new Demo Policy. Step 2 of 6 Adding to your configuration Now that you have a basic New Relic configuration created, add configurations built in the Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides in this step. Tip If you haven't done the previous developer guides, you can copy the configurations for this section from the Terragrunt Intro Github Repo. Update the main.tf to include the additional terraform configurations. Update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy You have added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. To clone the module from GitHub, run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply. After Terraform is done processing, You will see your Demo Policy now has two conditions in your New Relic account and one alert channel attached. Step 3 of 6 Using your Environment as a Terragrunt Variable Using Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you are running to the name of the data you are creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create a new input for env_name inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy in the main.tf file add a new variable for 'env_name' variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Using string interpolation, add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks. resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to the configuration name. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Currently, the environment variable name is hardcoded into the root terragrunt.hcl file. You want to avoid having your variables hardcoded, using a terragrunt built-in function will pass the value. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use the path_relative_to_include() built-in function and pass the value has the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output, the env_name variable will have the entire ./environments/dev/ path. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Next, update the terragrunt.hcl to only include 'dev' as the env_name variable. Adding a locals block creates a local variable, using the replace built-in function will remove the unwanted parts of the relative path, and update the inputs block to use the local variable. locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output the env_name variable will now have 'dev:' added. Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Step 4 of 6 Storing the State Remotely At the moment, the state file is local. The next steps will update your Terraform configurations to remove the local state file and use a file stored remotely in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, various state files will need to be store in separate S3 buckets, not to override each other. Terragrunt allows you to generate files on the fly. Adding the remote_state block into the root level terragrunt.hcl file, you will generate a new file named backend.tf. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"my-terraform-state\" key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true } } Copy After adding the remote_state block, you will need to give the configuration for the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state. Tip To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Now, update the remote_state block to provide your S3 bucket and update the key to use the local environment variable created previously. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Next, run terragrunt plan. If you look in the Amazon S3 bucket, you will see a folder named envs. Within the envs folder is a directory called devs containing terraform.tfstate file. Tip To see the files created by Terragrunt, look inside of the ./environments/dev directory. There is a hidden directory named terragrunt-cache. Within the terragrunt-cache directory, you will see the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Step 5 of 6 Creating a New Environment Now that you have a working configuration for your dev environment, you will create a new environment reusing the dev configurations in the next steps. In the environments directory, create a new folder names nonprod. In the nonprod folder, create a new terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl In the nonprod terragrunt.hcl file copy over the configuration from the environment terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you are using a different account for your nonprod environment, you can update the inputs with a new New Relic account ID and API key. Inside of your nonprod directory, run terragrunt init then run terragrunt apply. In the output, you will see Terraform has created a new set of resources. The new resources should have the nonprod name prefixed. Step 6 of 6 Terragrunt has created two environments, but there is no difference between them other than the name. Adding variables in the configurations allows your configurations to be more dynamic. In the next steps, you will add variables to your configurations. In the main.tf add new variables for the Host Conditions modules cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage values: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy In the main.tf update the HostConditions module values to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Run terragrunt plan. In the output, the HostConditions values have changed to use the variable defaults. Next, you want to pass the values into your environment configurations by adding the inputs block variables. In the nonprod/terragrunt.hcl file, add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy Run terragrunt apply. In your New Relic account, you will see a new policy with configurations changed based on the environment. Conclusion Congratulations! You've used Terragrunt to generate your New Relic configurations and manage multiple environments. Review the Terragrunt Intro Example, New Relic Terraform provider documentation, and Terragrunt quick start to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.12\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails.

Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Install Snapcraft, and then run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Install Homebrew, and then run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Install Scoop, and then run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Copy or write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity Using your entity guid, you can add tags right away. Invoke the entities tags create command. If you want to add multiple tags, use tag sets: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "Deploying an app can be a risky event—when your app breaks, a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts. Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Tip Deployment markers are not available for browser applications, but see browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'Api-Key'='$API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('Api-Key','$API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() Copy View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i Copy The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Copy Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. Important UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. Notify your team of deployments After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. Tip You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you easily get StatsD-format data into New Relic. You can also add any arbitrary tags (key-value pairs) to your data. Once your metrics are in New Relic, you can query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Requirements This integration uses our Metric API and our Event API to ingest data. To use these APIs, you'll need an Insert API key. The integration adheres to the Metric API requirements and data limits. The default rate limit is 100,000 data points per minute (DPM). If you think you're missing metrics or sending more than 100K DPM, see Request data changes. To see if your account is hitting the rate limit, run the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' FACET category, message LIMIT 100 since 1 day ago Copy Install This section will explain how to do a standard install. If you want to run StatsD in Kubernetes, see Kubernetes install. To install the StatsD integration, run the following command and include your New Relic account ID and New Relic Insert API key. This generates a TOML configuration file used by gostatsd. docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy If your account is in the EU data center region, add this to the above command: -e NR_EU_REGION=true \\ Copy After installing, you can: Do optional additional configuration Define your metrics Add custom tags to your data Create alerts Install for Kubernetes Here are examples of Kubernetes manifests for deployment and service objects: Kubernetes manifest examples Below are examples of Kubernetes manifests to deploy StatsD in a Kubernetes environment and create a StatsD service named newrelic-statsd. You need to insert your account ID and your license key. deployment.yml: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: selector: matchLabels: app: newrelic-statsd replicas: 2 revisionHistoryLimit: 2 template: metadata: labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: containers: - name: newrelic-statsd image: newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 env: - name: NR_ACCOUNT_ID value: \"NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID\" - name: NR_API_KEY value: \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy service.yml: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: newrelic-statsd port: 80 targetPort: 8125 protocol: UDP selector: app: newrelic-statsd Copy For configuration details, see Kubernetes configuration. Configure In the install procedure, you run nri-statsd with environment variables, and this generates a TOML configuration file. Additionally, you can set these configuration options: Configuration options Description expiry-interval string If a metric is not updated for this amount of time, we stop reporting that metric. Default is 5m. If you want to send the metrics only if the value was updated between the flush intervals, configure this to 1ms. To never expire metrics, set it to 0. percent-threshold list of integers Specifies the percentiles used for metrics aggregation. Default: 90. metrics-addr string Indicates address on which to listen for metrics. Default: :8125. Tip To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the StatsD integration you must define the following endpoints in the custom configuration: address = 'https://gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/ $NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' Copy address-metrics = 'https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' Copy Here are some examples of customizing configuration by overwriting the default configuration: Example of custom configuration # Specify after how long do we expire metrics, default:5m expiry-interval = '1ms' # percent-threshold specify a list of percentiles for metrics aggregation, default:90 percent-threshold = [90, 99] backends='newrelic' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy Disable timer sub-metrics: By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. If you want to disable those metrics you can do it by adding a disabled-sub-metrics configuration section and set true for the ones you want disabled. Here's an example: # disabled-sub-metrics configuration section allows disabling timer sub-metrics [disabled-sub-metrics] # Regular metrics count=false count-per-second=false mean=false median=false lower=false upper=false stddev=false sum=false sum-squares=false # Percentile metrics count-pct=false mean-pct=false sum-pct=false sum-squares-pct=false lower-pct=false upper-pct=false Copy Docker: overwrite default configuration To overwrite the default nri-statsd configuration while running in a container, you can mount a configuration file inside the container. You can adopt the following template as needed for your situation. Example: backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To run the container with the file mounted in the appropriate path: docker run \\ ... -v ${PWD}/nri-statsd.toml:/etc/opt/newrelic/nri-statsd.toml \\ ... newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Kubernetes: overwrite default configuration The best approach to configure nri-statsd running in Kubernetes is to use a configMap and mount the configMap into the container. (This is a similar process to mounting the configuration file in Docker.) Example: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-statsd-config namespace: default data: nri-statsd.toml: | backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = '$NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To use the configMap, declare a volume on your deployment spec template and then declare a volumeMount on your container spec. Example: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment spec: template: spec: containers: .... volumeMounts: - mountPath: /etc/opt/newrelic/ name: nri-statsd-config volumes: - name: nri-statsd-config configMap: name: nri-statsd-config Copy Metric format The integration receives metrics using the StatsD protocol. Optionally, the sample rate can be configured and tags can be added. Here's the metric data format we use: <metric name>:<value>|<type>|@<sample rate>|#<tags> Copy Here are explanations of these fields: Field name Description < metric name> string Required. Name of the metric. < value> string Required. The metric type: c = counter g = gauge ms = timer @ < sample rate> float Optional for simple counters or timer counters. When many metrics must be sent, you can use sampling to reduce network traffic. The downside is a reduction in the resolution of the data. An example of how this would work for sample rates below 1: If you set this to 0.1, the counter would send a measurement one out of every 10 times. # < tags> string Optional. Tags attached to your metrics are converted into attributes (key-value pairs). For more on tagging options, see Tags. Metric types Here are the types of metrics and how to format them: Counter A counter measures the number of occurrences of an event. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. A counter can be incremented or decremented during the same flush interval by adding a sign to the value. In the following example, the counter value will be 2: counter:4|c counter:-2|c Copy At each flush, the current count is sent and reset to 0. If the count is not updated, at the next flush it will send the value 0. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Here’s an example of a counter that is being sampled 1 out of 10 times: counter:4|c@0.1 Copy Gauge A gauge represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include temperature, CPU usage, and memory. Here's an example: temperature:40|g Copy If the gauge is not updated, at the next flush it will send the previous value. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Timer The timer metric type measures timing data. By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. These are sent as sub-metrics in the following format: <metric_base_name>.std_dev <metric_base_name>.median <metric_base_name>.summary <metric_base_name>.sum_squares <metric_base_name>.mean <metric_base_name>.per_second Copy The configured percentiles will generate the following metrics. The percentile threshold value will be attached as a tag. <metric_base_name>.sum_squares.percentiles <metric_base_name>.sum.percentiles <metric_base_name>.count.percentiles <metric_base_name>.upper.percentiles <metric_base_name>.mean.percentiles Copy The percentile threshold can be tweaked with the percent-threshold config option. These can be controlled through the disabled-sub-metrics configuration section. Add tags (attributes) You can add tags to your data, which we save as attributes (key-value pairs). There are two options for adding tags: Add default tags that apply to all metrics: These apply to all metrics. They are fixed and don't change over time. Add metric-level tags: These apply to specific metrics and allow the value to be changed between two submits. Add default tags that apply to all metrics Add tags to metrics and events by defining an environment variable in the startup command. Here's an example that would create two tags: -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" Copy Here's that environment variable used in the startup command: docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Add metric-level tags When defining the metric format, you can add tags using this format: <bucket name>:<value>|<type>|#<tags> Copy In this example, <tags> is a comma-separated list of tags. Tags format is: simple or key:value. Here's an example NRQL query that includes a custom tag: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE environment = 'production' Copy Create alerts You can alert on StatsD data using NRQL alert conditions. Alert example This procedure walks you through sending some sample data and then creating an alert condition using that data. First, send this data to New Relic’s StatsD container: echo \"prod.test.num:32|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Next, create a NRQL alert condition using this query: SELECT latest(prod.test.num) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'prod.test.num' Copy Here's an image showing creating this NRQL alert condition. Notice that the sample data sent in is represented by the blue dot on the upper right of the chart. Now we can create the alert condition with these settings: When you create the NRQL alert condition, be sure to set the Condition name. If a metric with a value above 50 is sent, then an incident is created and notified. The incident is closed automatically after 24 hours. To test that the alert is working, run this command: echo \"prod.test.num:60|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Find and use data To query your data, you'd use any New Relic query option. For example, you might run a NRQL query like: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'myMetric' and environment = 'production' Copy For more on how to query the Metric data type, see Query metric data.

      "body": "You can use our NerdGraph API to add tags to your data to help improve data organization and findability. Overview This doc explains how to use our NerdGraph API to add and manage tags. Note that this is only one way to add tags. For other methods, see How tags are added. For how to automate tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Read tags for an entity To construct these queries and see responses: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to find the entity and then fetch its tags. Use NerdGraph's tag API to read the existing tags and their values. In this example, our entity is a browser app called Cookie Checkout: { actor { entitySearch (query: \"name like 'Cookie Checkout'\") { results { entities { tags { key values } } } } } } Copy The actual values vary depending on your data. Use the New Relic GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Add tags for an entity To add new tags for an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity you want to tag. Use the taggingAddTagsToEntity mutation to add a tag with a value to the entity. In this example, we have a browser application called Cookie Checkout owned by a UI team. We want to add a team tag with a ui value to this instance. Once the tag is added, we can filter by the tag team:ui and find the Cookie Checkout app in the New Relic One UI. mutation { taggingAddTagsToEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: { key: \"team\", values: [\"ui\"]}) { errors { message } } } Copy Remove a tag from an entity To delete a tag and all of its associated values from an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation removes the team tag from an entity: mutation { taggingDeleteTagFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagKeys: [\"team\"]) { errors { message } } } Copy Delete specific tag values for an entity Instead of deleting an entire tag and all of its values, you can delete a single tag value. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation deletes the ui value from the tag key: mutation { taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagValues : [{key: \"team\" value: \"ui\"}]) { errors { message } } } Copy Because tagValues is an array, you can delete multiple specific values from a single entity in one mutation. Replace all tag values for an entity To replace the entity’s entire set of tags with the provided tag set: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity mutation. In this example, the Cookie Checkout browser application was transferred from the ui team to the cookie-dev team. You can replace the tag values for team with the following mutation: mutation { taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: {key: \"team\" values: [\"cookie-dev\"]}) { errors { message } } } Copy",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region), and you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Help you query and chart APM data Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. Tip At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in Tag sources, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

Requirements: Pro or Enterprise edition. SCIM provisioning, also referred to as automated user management (AUM): SCIM provisioning allows organizations to use their identity provider service to automate how their users are added to and updated in New Relic. By definition, SCIM provisioning requires use of SAML SSO, but SAML SSO doesn't require SCIM. Requirements: Enterprise edition, and organization must be on the New Relic One user model (more on that below). Before enabling these, it's important to understand another major factor that affects these features: which account/user model your organization is on. In 2020, we released a new and improved account/user model, called the New Relic One user model. At first mainly new customers used this model, but now it’s available to some of our older customers via a self-serve user migration procedure. Over time, all organizations will be migrated to this model. For information on how to enable SAML and SCIM, choose your account/user model below. If you’re not sure which you’re on, see Overview of account/user model. New Relic One user/account model If your organization is on the New Relic One account/user model, you'll use the authentication domain UI to set up SAML and SCIM. Note that Okta, OneLogin, and Azure have dedicated New Relic apps: if you use those, you must choose the one called \"New Relic by organization\", and not \"New Relic by account\". Original user/account model If your organization is on the original account/user model, we recommend migrating your users via the self-serve migration procedure if you’re able to. If you don’t meet the requirements but want to enable SAML and/or SCIM, please speak to your New Relic account representative. Here are some tips and docs links: SAML: If you want to or must stay on the original user model and can’t migrate to the new model, see our original SAML docs. SCIM + SAML: SCIM provisioning creates users on the new model. This is why your organization must first switch to the new user model before using SCIM. For more on how to migrate to the new model, see Migrate users.",

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to New Relic Full-Stack Observability Enterprise or New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and errorBeacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Note: You only need to modify the beacon and errorBeacon properties in the NREUM.info object. These values will override the default values found in the NR loader script. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. Currently Infinite Tracing is not FedRAMP compliant.",

      "body": "One of the ways to report custom data to New Relic is with custom events and attributes. Have questions about why you'd use custom data? See Introduction to custom data. Requirements For event and attribute formatting requirements and best practices, see Limits and requirements. Avoid rate limits Reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance. It may also result in approaching or passing data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Example use cases Two popular custom data solutions are custom events and custom attributes. There are several ways to accomplish this (more on that later in this doc), depending on your New Relic implementation and tools. Here are some common use cases for implementing custom events and attributes. Using custom attributes Custom attributes are often used to add important business and operational context to existing events. Business context might include: Customer token Customer market segment Customer value classification Workflow control values not obvious in the URIStem User/product/account privilege context Operational context might include: Which feature flags were used What datastore was accessed What cache was accessed What errors were detected and ignored (fault partitioning) Using custom events Event data is one of New Relic's four core data types. We recommend reading that definition to understand what we mean by \"event\" and why that data type is most used for reporting specific types of activity. The use cases for custom events varies widely: basically they are used for any type of activity that an organization deems important and that is not already being monitored. A couple examples: An event might represent an activity involving multiple actions, like a customer purchasing a certain combination of products. An event might record backup activity. For example, they might set up reporting of events that represent production backups of their SOLR instances into an event table, with a timestamp of when it occurred, which cluster, and the duration. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser monitoring agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure monitoring agent Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile monitoring agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetic monitoring Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools. For ways to report other types of custom data, see: Metric API Logs Trace API Extend data retention To learn how to extend how long events are retained in your account, see our documentation about event data retention.",

      "body": "New Relic has resource limits in place to protect your experience, our systems, and our other customers. These limits range from the maximum number of characters you can have in a query, to API request rates, to how many events your queries inspect, and more. This page describes the limit metrics and NrIntegrationError events that enable you to view your limits, your current data usage and overall resource consumption as compared to those limits, and the impact of experiencing a limit event. We also provide a handful of queries that, when compiled into a dashboard, can give you consistent insight into your limits status. Important While NrIntegrationError events cover many limits, resource metrics currently only cover request rate ingestion limits. What happens when you reach a limit Our response to reaching a limit depends on a handful of factors: the type of limit that’s reached, as well as the duration, frequency, and amount at which you exceed the limit. Exceeding a limit doesn’t always mean you experience a limit event, such as dropped data, rejected traffic, or having your data turned off for the rest of the day. We sometimes allow a small buffer before enforcing a limit. That said, any resource consumed above 100% is at risk for limit impact at any time. Many of our rate limits apply proportionally. That means if you’re barely exceeding the limit, we will take less action than if you're exceeding by 200%. Limit metrics are only visible if you're sending data in to a corresponding dataType or limitName API. For example, if you send in data via the Metric API, you’ll see the Metric API resource metrics, but if you don't send any APM data in, you won't see APM resource metrics. Tip Impact metrics will be generated regardless of impact; if there's no impact, you’ll see a 0. An NrIntegrationError is generated when you experience impact and is a good way to quickly see if you’re experiencing any limit events. See View System Limits for more information. Create a dashboard to view your limit status Using three limit metrics together on a dashboard, you can quickly see detailed visuals of your Ingest Resource Request Per Minute limits, and with NrIngrationError get a view into more limits. Dashboard displaying limits status using a handful of queries. We used the following queries to create this dashboard. To make a dashboard like this in New Relic One, select Dashboards, and then Create a dashboard. Then, add a new chart for each query you want to regularly monitor. The three limits metrics included in these queries are described in a separate section, below. From left to right, top to bottom: Resource Consumption Limits as a % FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) /latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Max % Consumption in an hour SELECT max(`usage`) FROM (FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 as 'usage' facet limitName timeseries ) facet limitName limit max Copy APM Agent API transaction events request per minute FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) where limitName = 'APM Agent API transaction events requests per minute' TIMESERIES Copy Trace API With limit line FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) as 'usage', latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) as 'limit' where limitName = 'Trace API requests per minute' TIMESERIES Copy Impact FACET From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource TIMESERIES 1 minute limit max Copy NrIntegrationError by limit FROM NrIntegrationError select count(*) facet limitName TIMESERIES MAX since 1 day ago limit max Copy Multi-Account limits (on time series charts only) If you want to see limits for multiple accounts on one chart: run this query from one of the accounts: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName, consumingAccountId where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Click Add another query. Select a different account. Then run this query again: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName, consumingAccountId where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Finally, save it. Limit list and NrIntegrationError FROM Metric, NrIntegrationError select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) as 'Per Minute Count',latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) as ' limit Value',(rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue)*100)as 'Percent Used', filter (count(*), where NrIntegrationError.limitValue is not null) as 'limit reached count' facet limitName limit 1000 Copy Limit metrics These metrics, used in the dashboard queries above, can hone in on a single limit or resource. Or, with the help of FACET limitName or resource provide a view across all your limits. newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue limitValue allows you to see the setting for a limit by limitName and understand more about what resource is linked to this limit. The following examples use the limit value metric in the query: Example for Metric API requests per minute. FROM Metric select latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) where limitName = 'Metric API requests per minute' Copy To show all limits, add FACET limitName and consider grouping by limitTimeInterval. FROM Metric select latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) WHERE limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' FACET limitName limit max Copy newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue currentValue shows you how much of a given resource you’re currently consuming. To get a better glimpse into how our systems are viewing your consumption, use a rate() function with the time period that aligns with the limitTimeInterval. Limit 200. Example for Metric API request per minute: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue),1 minute) where limitName = 'Metric API requests per minute' Copy To show all limits, add FACET limitName and consider grouping by limitTimeInterval. FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue),1 minute) where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' FACET limitName limit max Copy newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact impact lets you know for any given resource what impact limit events are having. Zeros mean you are not currently impacted. The most granular we have is dataType. It is possible for multiple instances of limitName to impact a single type, such as Metric RPM and DPM. If we know, we will display limitName. From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, resource, impact, limitName TIMESERIES limit max Copy Metric attributes Attributes on newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue and newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue: limitName - The Name of the limit for the metric data, i.e RPM Metric API. dataType - What kind of data the metric is tracking, i.e Metric, Log, or APM. Resource - What resource is being consumed, i.e. Requests, or DPM. limitTimeInterval - What time window this resource is evaluated for limiting. consumingAccountId - The New Relic account where the resource is being consumed. Attributes on newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact dataType - The kind of data that is being impacted, i.e Metric, Log, APM. Resource - What resource is being impacted, i.e Request Rate. Impact - A count of what is happening when resource has exceeded set limit, i.e dropped requests. consumingAccountId - The New Relic account where the resource is being consumed. Set alerts on resource metrics While building a dashboard to see all your limits is handy, being able to automate it is even better. You can set alerts on your limit metrics to provide updates on limits changes. Tip Because we currently only have metrics on 1 minute time windows, setting TimeWindow = 1 minute, will cover them all. Eventually, we make more metrics available, you might want to set separate alerts for limits that are enforced by different time windows. You can use the following NRQL queries to create alerts. Learn about creating alerts with NRQL queries here. Limits faceted by LimitName and scoped by Timewindow From Metric select (rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue))*100 facet limitName Copy Alert on a single limit From Metric select (rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue))*100 where limitName = 'my limit' Copy Alert on limit impact faceted by dataType, impact, resource, and reason From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource, reason Copy Alert on impact of a single dataType From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource, reason WHERE dataType = 'important things' Copy",

      "body": "With New Relic's Node.js agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime Use native deploy To use Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with your Node.js app: Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Optional: Set environment variables to configure the Node.js agent's GAE app.yaml file. Use the Google Cloud SDK's gcloud command line tool to deploy GAE apps. To deploy your Node.js app to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project new-relic-apm-nodejs app deploy Copy Google App Engine automatically includes your Node.js app's newrelic.js configuration file in the deployed package. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. You can deploy the app without any special configuration. For more information about deploying and configuring your Node.js app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Node.js Google App Engine's tutorial to deploy a Node.js app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Copy Optional: Set environment variables. 3. Configure and deploy The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the Dockerfile, build the container, and deploy your app, follow the GAE procedures for Node.js. Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Optional: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in New Relic APM. If you notice performance issues, disable GAE health checks. In your app.yaml, add: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Node.js agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "With our Go agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. Here we explain how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and give an example of deploying a Go app with Docker. Important The Go agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the Go agent, building a custom Go runtime for Docker, and deploying a golang application. For more information about deploying and configuring your Go app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Go Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Go app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Go agent for your specific app server, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Go to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, download and install git, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. The following Dockerfile example code defines the golang version used. FROM golang:1.8-onbuild CMD go run main.go Copy 4. Build a Docker image To build the Docker image, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build --rm -t Docker-image-name . Copy 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project go-app-name app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see GAE's documentation for debugging an instance.

A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'.

Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period.

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default mobile monitoring events using the mobile agent SDKs. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the crash event trail UI. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your New Relic APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

      "body": "The thread profiler is a low-impact profiling tool that can be used in production to identify bottlenecks in an application. It works by periodically (100ms) capturing the stack trace of each thread for a specified duration. At the end of the specified duration, the stack traces are aggregated to build a tree. The call count in the tree corresponds to the number of times that function was present in the stack traces under the same context. Although the call tree cannot capture the entire execution, a large enough sample can be a good representation of the application behavior. This provides insights into the \"hot\" functions of the app where most of the time is spent. With this scope, entries sampled less than 0.05% are omitted. Supported agents This feature is available only for specific agents and versions: Java: Agent versions 1.2.004.6 or higher .NET: Framework: Agent versions 2.12.146.0 or higher .NET Core 2.0: Agent versions 8.3.360.0 or higher (Windows only) Linux: .NET Core 3.0 or higher and agent versions 8.23 or higher Python: Agent versions 1.7.0 or higher Ruby: Agent versions 3.5.5 or higher Start the profiler The thread profiler feature is enabled by default. You also may be able to turn it on or off in your agent configuration file: Java: thread_profiler.enabled NET: You cannot disable the thread profiler with .NET apps.

Select the host you want to run the profiler on. Set the duration for the profiling session. Select Start profiler. This triggers the agent to start the thread profiler during the next harvest cycle (every one minute) and capture data for the specified duration.

Agent considerations Depending on which agent you use, the thread profiling feature has additional considerations. .NET-specific notes When using thread profiling with the .NET Framework agent, be aware of the following. .NET agent Thread profiler notes Supported on Linux Thread profiling on Linux is supported on .NET Core 3.0 or later applications when running .NET agent version 8.23 or later. Managed threads only For .NET agents, the thread profiler only captures stack traces on managed threads. It does not capture stack traces on unmanaged threads. If a call to an unmanaged function occurs on a managed thread, the thread profiler will show Native:Function Call in the call tree. No line numbers A .NET thread profile does not include line numbers in the call tree. The Show line numbers checkbox in the Tree Settings does not have any effect. Bug with 64-bit v4.0 .NET CLR There is a bug in the 64-bit version 4.0 .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) that interferes with the agent's ability to retrieve managed stack traces. If your app experiences this bug, APM will show empty thread profiles. This bug does not affect 32-bit applications. The bug is fixed in the CLR releases for .NET 4.5. To verify whether your 64-bit application has the fixed version, look at the full version of the mscorlib.dll in the C: \\ Windows \\ Microsoft.NET \\ Framework64 \\ v4.0.30319 directory. The fix is in versions 4.0.30319.17379 or higher. Other category only All threads are put in the Other category. The Web Request and Background categories are not supported. Python-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Python agent, be aware of the following. Python agent Thread profiler notes Co-routine based systems There are limits to capturing details when a co-routine based system is being used, such as gevent or eventlet modes of gunicorn. If creating a new thread, the Python agent will actually create a greenlet instead of a thread profiler background thread. Therefore, the thread profiler will not capture any web request and background transactions on the thread profiler page. Greenlets A greenlet can run only when other greenlets explicitly yield control, such as when they block. For example, if the thread sampler does get to run, it will only sample the stack for other greenlets at a point where they are blocked. It will not sample them when they are executing arbitrary code. It can completely miss execution within a greenlet if it never blocked or otherwise yielded to another greenlet. Time in Python code Time spent in pure Python code that isn't blocking requests will not be picked up, and no information will be recorded or reported. This is because results are misleading when co-routines are used. Ruby-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Ruby agent, be aware of the following. Ruby agent Thread profiler notes Backtraces The thread profiler depends on the ability to capture thread backtraces from within your Ruby application. For this reason, it requires MRI 1.9.2 or higher (for the Thread#backtrace method). Resque The Ruby agent does not currently support thread profiles with Resque background jobs. A thread profiling session initiated against Resque will only capture traces from the parent process, not the job processes. JRuby JRuby support is considered experimental at this time. There are known issues with JRuby's Thread#backtrace implementation that will affect the accuracy of and reliability of backtraces collected under JRuby.",

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that each require their own type of API key to use. This resource describes our API keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. Manage API keys in UI Here's a direct link to the API keys UI page. To find this from the New Relic UI: From the account dropdown, select API keys. Overview of API keys The table below summarizes our available API keys and their uses. Important Some keys are able to be used by more than one API. If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. Key type What it's for Where to access User key (Also known as a \"personal API key\") Used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints (dependent on user permissions). API keys UI License key Allows ingestion of data from APM agents, the infrastructure agent, and some other data-ingest APIs. API keys UI Insights insert key (Also known as a \"Insert key\") Allows ingestion of events via HTTPS request from our metric, log, trace, and event APIs and the tools that use those APIs. Go to the API keys UI and click Insights insert key. Browser key Allows ingestion of browser monitoring data. API keys UI Mobile key (aka \"mobile app token\") Allows mobile monitoring data to be sent to New Relic. See Mobile app token. REST API key Note: we recommend using the user key instead because it has fewer limitations. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Go to the API keys UI and click REST API key. Admin API key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. For more information, see Admin key and User key below. API keys UI (will appear as user keys) Insights query key (aka \"Query key\") This key allows use of the Insights query API. Note: we now recommend using NerdGraph to query New Relic data. Go to the API keys UI and click Insights query key. User key New Relic user keys (previously referred to as \"personal API keys\") are required for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API), which allows you to query most New Relic data and do some types of configuration. User keys also let you use our REST API, with restrictions based on your permissions. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a user key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select User. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key. In the Notes field, add relevant details about the key. Click Create. Edit a user key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the user key you want to edit, click ... and select Edit. Make your changes and click Update key. Delete a user key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the user key you want to delete, click ... and select Delete. Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. Tip In December 2020, user keys supplanted Admin API keys. For details, see Admin API key. License key New Relic license keys allow the ingestion of data from APM agents, the infrastructure agent, and some other data-ingest APIs. If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required or recommended. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a license key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select License. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key. In the Notes field, add relevant details about the key. Click Create. Edit a license key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the license key you want to edit, click ... and select Edit. Make your changes and click Update key. Delete a license API key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the license key you want to delete, click ... and select Delete. Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. Important You can't manage or delete an original license key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Browser key The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a browser key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select Browser. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key. In the Notes field, add relevant details about the key. Click Create. Edit a browser key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the browser API key you want to edit, click ... and select Edit. Make your changes and click Update key. Delete a browser key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the browser API key you want to delete, click ... and select Delete. Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. Important You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. You can use a REST API key with our REST API and the API Explorer. For accounts that have sub-accounts, each sub-account must use its own REST API key. Requirements: Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. Activate or change REST API key Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Click Regenerate REST API key. Click (Show key) to view your account's new REST API key. Copy your account's REST API key to use with New Relic's REST API. View REST API keys To view REST API keys: Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Click (Show key) to view your account's new REST API key. Delete REST API key To delete your account's REST API key: Before you delete an API key, make sure you have the correct account or sub-account. Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Select the delete icon for the REST API key. Confirm the deletion by typing DELETION IS FOREVER in the text field. Select Delete. Insights insert key The Insights insert key (aka the \"Insert key\") is required for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. Generate an Insights insert key Go to the API keys UI and select Insights insert keys. Next to the Insert keys heading, select the button. A cURL command containing your insert key will appear, as well as NRQL query field. Edit the NRQL query field. Add comments in the Notes field if desired. Click Save your notes. Edit or delete an Insights insert key Go to the API keys UI and select Insights insert keys. Under Insert Keys, find the key you want to modify. Select Edit or Delete. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. Generate an Insights query key You must have access to the UIs you plan to query and the correct permissions in order to register or modify this key. Important Insights query keys are generated per account; they're not associated with a specific user. This means that any user in an account with access to a query key can use it. To register this key: Go to the API keys UI and select Insights query keys. Next to the Query Keys heading, select the button. A cURL command containing your insert key will appear, as well as NRQL query field. Edit the NRQL query field. Add comments in the Notes field if desired. Click Save your notes. Edit or delete an Insights query key To edit or delete this key: Go to the API keys UI page and select Insights query keys. Under Query Keys, find the key you want to modify. Select Edit or Delete. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily.",

      "body": "New Relic One is a powerful observability platform that gives you access to all your data throughout your entire system. We host telemetry data sent by your entities, which basically is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor, including applications, services, hosts, etc. You name it! Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds, and install any of our agents or integrations. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. While we provide you with an out of the box experience to see your data with curated dashboards, you can tailor the access to your data and custom the visibility in several ways, including in the UI or via API. Important To better understand your data stored in New Relic, see Data types. Our open door to your data Regardless of your experience with New Relic, we’ll help you discover, understand and visualize your data. You... Then do this... Just installed an agent and want to see your data in New Relic. Browse your data easily without building queries. With the data explorer, you can understand the data we’ve stored, see its cardinality, or build charts in a few clicks. Know what data is available, but you want to understand more about what else is coming with that data. If you’re an advanced user, use our query builder to tailor the data you want to retrieve. Have a specific question and you want to deep dive on the data to get the answer. Refine your NRQL query to dig down to the bottom of your issues. Want to build a dashboard. Create a custom dashboard easily from the data explorer or the query builder. Browse your data in the UI New Relic One offers several experiences that don't require knowledge of NRQL or any query language. On the UI, go to the Query your data button, or click the Browse data dropdown, then select the data type (metrics, events, logs, and traces) you want to explore. For events and metrics, use the data explorer, an intuitive data navigator to create visualizations. From the explorer you can switch to the query builder to see and refine your query. Distributed tracing query: a specialized UI for querying traces. Logs query: a specialized UI for querying New Relic Logs data. Query data in the UI If you're ready to do more than browsing data, become an all-hands actor and personalize your queries in the New Relic UI. Use query languages, including our New Relic query language or our PromQL-style query language, to edit queries with full flexibility. For example, you can add more WHERE clauses, modify the returned value, change to other types of visualizations, etc. Tip Are you new to querying languages? Start browsing data in the data explorer, then turn to the query builder to see the query you built, and refine it. There are two ways to write your own queries to retrieve data and build charts: Query builder in NRQL mode: Query using New Relic query language (NRQL), the same language we use to build most of our UI experiences, and the most advanced way of querying data in New Relic. Query builder in PromQL-style mode: Write basic queries using a PromQL-style query. Query data via API When getting into the New Relic platform is not an option, you can use APIs to retrieve and query your data in New Relic. For example, you can run NRQL (our query language) queries with NerdGraph (our GraphQL API). For more information, see the introduction to New Relic APIs.",

This document provides examples and reference information for our API endpoints. For developer-focused content on how to use and customize New Relic, see developer.newrelic.com. Tip To use APIs and SDKs, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL-format API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph is the preferred API for querying New Relic data and making a range of feature configurations. To get started, see Introduction to NerdGraph. REST APIs by capability New Relic capabilities, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, or alerts, are often used together, and sometimes they overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Tip To learn more about different API key types, see Understand New Relic API keys. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data.

Telemetry APIs for core data types We offer several APIs that allow you to get our core data types (metrics, logs, traces, and events) into New Relic without the use of an installed agent. Data type Description Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic. Event API Send event data to New Relic. Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage You can use the Query API to retrieve subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API To retrieve information about your New Relic partner account, sub-accounts, and users, use the Partner API. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API To query your data using NRQL-format queries, you can use the Query API. Note that this API is deprecated and NerdGraph is preferred for querying your data. Dashboard API See the Insights Dashboard API. Plugins Use the REST API for New Relic plugins and the API Explorer to: Get a list of plugins, including their names, IDs, and GUIDs. List one or more plugin components, their output, and their metric timeslice data. Developers and New Relic partners can also use New Relic's Plugin API to write an agent in any language that can work directly with the API for plugins. This allows you to send your own metric data to our plugins and view data received from the API in New Relic.

Starting out with NerdGraph If you're new to NerdGraph and GraphQL, you may want to first read our Introduction to NerdGraph. If you’re already familiar with the dashboards API, you can read Create dashboards with NerdGraph. When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. Find the NerdGraph API explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Operations We have defined a granular GraphQL API that lets you execute different dashboard operations depending on their goal and scope. Dashboard CRUD operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes actor > entity() query Get dashboard operation. You can get all dashboard and widget data for a given dashboard entity GUID. dashboardCreate() mutation Create dashboard operation. You can create a dashboard attached to a specific account by specifying all its elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardUpdate() mutation Update dashboard operation. You can update an existing dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. You need to specify the complete, updated dashboard elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardDelete() mutation Delete dashboard operation. You can delete an existing dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. This operation executes a logical delete that lets you recover your dashboard. dashboardUndelete() mutation Undelete dashboard operation. You can recover a previously deleted dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. Dashboard page operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes dashboardUpdatePage() mutation Update dashboard page operation. You can update one page of an existing dashboard given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the complete, updated dashboard page elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardUpdateWidgetsInPage() mutation Update widgets operation. You can update a set of existing widgets of a dashboard page given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the set of widgets to be updated and their complete configuration. dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() mutation Add widgets operation. You can add a set of new widgets to a dashboard page given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the set of new widgets and their complete configuration. Other operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes dashboardCreateSnapshotUrl() mutation Create dashboard page snapshot operation. You can create a public URL for a given dashboard page entity GUID. The dashboard page can then be accessed in the form of a static snapshot in the resulting public URL. actor > dashboard > liveUrls() query List all live URLs operation. You can get the complete list of live URLs you have access to. A live URL is a mechanism that allows you to share dashboard pages and widgets publicly with up-to-date or live data. dashboardWidgetRevokeLiveUrl() mutation Revoke widget live URL operation. You can revoke a previously created live URL of a widget. As a result, the live URL will become unavailable to the public. Limits We have limited the values you can set to some of the dashboard properties. This allows us to keep dashboards in good shape while boosting their usability. Dashboard limits Limit Value Maximum number of pages in a dashboard 20 Maximum length of a dashboard name 255 Maximum length of a dashboard description 1024 Dashboard page limits Limit Value Maximum number of widgets in a dashboard page 40 Maximum length of a dashboard page name 255 Maximum length of a dashboard page description 1024 Widget limits Limit Value Maximum length of a widget title 255 Maximum number of entities linked to a widget 1 Maximum number of queries in a widget 20 Maximum layout column of a widget 12 Minimum layout column of a widget 1 Minimum layout row of a widget 1 Maximum layout width of a widget 12 Minimum layout width of a widget 1 Maximum layout height of a widget 8 Minimum layout height of a widget 1 Errors as first class citizens All dashboard mutations offer a way to ask for errors when being executed. This means that you can perform your dashboard mutations and check the response in order to detect expected potential issues. Every error has a type and a description to help you identify what’s the source of the problem. Errors as part of every mutation response mutation { dashboardMutation(guid: \"MY_EXISTING_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { mutationResult { result } errors { description type } } } Copy Keep in mind that these are expected errors that we are aware of in advance. You should also check for unexpected errors that will be returned in the standard GraphQL errors field.",

      "body": "Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Install Snapcraft, and then run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Install Homebrew, and then run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Install Scoop, and then run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Copy or write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity Using your entity guid, you can add tags right away. Invoke the entities tags create command. If you want to add multiple tags, use tag sets: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "With secrets management, you can configure the agent and on-host integrations to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the configuration files. Currently, Hashicorp Vault, AWS KMS, CyberArk and New Relic CLI obfuscation are supported. Define secrets To use secrets in a configuration YAML file: Define a variables section, where each entry is a name for a secret object. In each entry, include the source of the secret and the proper configuration to retrieve those secrets. In the general configuration section, set ${variable.property} placeholders that will be automatically replaced by the properties of the secret object. The secret object can be defined as a simple string or json object. Important If the secrets retrieval fails, the integration won't be executed, as the infrastructure agent does not have all the data it requires to execute. For example, the following configuration will retrieve an object named creds from Vault (you can define the object's name for the secret.) Let's assume that the stored object is a valid JSON with a property named user and another property named password. We want to use them to set the basic HTTP credentials of the status_url property from an Nginx on-host integration: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Tip Both simple strings and valid JSON objects can be retrieved from variables. When using JSON objects make sure both keys and values are enclosed with double-quotes. Using environment variables Environment variables can be used into the variables section with the {{MY_ENV_VAR}} notation. When doing so, environment variables are expanded and their value is replaced at runtime. Use this method to avoid having sensitive values such as tokens or obfuscation keys included in the configuration file. When using environment variables in on-host integration configuration files the passthrough_environment setting must be defined. Secrets variables Define secrets in each configuration under a variables section. Each entry is a user-defined secret name that will store the properties of the retrieved secrets. Each variable can contain the following properties: YAML key Description ttl Type: String Amount of time before a secret is refreshed. This can be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h). Examples: 30s, 10m, 1h Default: 1h aws-kms AWS KMS secret retrieval configuration vault Vault secret retrieval configuration cyberark-cli CyberArk command line interface configuration cyberark-api CyberArk REST API configuration obfuscated New Relic CLI obfuscation AWS KMS secrets To retrieve your secrets from Amazon KMS, you can set the following properties in your aws-kms section. Not all fields are required. For example, you will need either data, file, or http to provide the encoded KMS string. YAML key Description data Type: String Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt file Type: String Path to file containing Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt http Type: YAML properties HTTP configuration to use to request Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt. For more information, see Vault http. credential_file Type: String Path to AWS credentials file config_file Type: String Path to AWS config file region Type: String AWS KMS region type Type: String (plain, equal, or json) Secret value format: plain: a raw string to be stored directly into the destination variable. equal: a key=property one-line string to be stored as object properties into the destination variable. json: a JSON object to be stored as properties into the destination variable. Secrets of type plain or json use dot notation; for example, ${mysecret.nestedkey}. The following example will allow retrieving a plain password string from AWS KMS. It must be decrypted from the provided data encoded string. variables: myPassword: aws-kms: data: T0hBSStGTEVY region: ap-southeast-2 credential_file: \"./my-aws-credentials-file\" config_file: \"./my-aws-config-file\" type: plain Copy Vault secrets Vault must enable an http field containing the HTTP configuration used to connect to Vault. The http entry can contain the following entries: YAML key Description url Type: String URL to request data from tls_config Type: YAML properties Use the TLS configuration properties headers Type: YAML map Request headers tls_config properties Important Secrets must use dot notation, for example, ${mysecret.nestedkey}. YAML key Description enable Type: Boolean Enable TLS Default: false insecure_skip_verify Type: Boolean Skip verifying server’s certificate chain and host Default: false min_version Type: UInt16 The minimum SSL/TLS version that is acceptable Default: 0 (which uses TLS version 1.0) max_version Type: UInt16 The maximum SSL/TLS version that is acceptable Default: 0 (which uses TLS version 1.3) ca Type: String TLS certificate \"\" The following example will retrieve a secret using a Vault token from a secured server, and skip the server certificates verification: variables: mydata: vault: http: url: https://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token tls_config: insecure_skip_verify: true Copy CyberArk command line interface To retrieve secrets from the CyberArk command line interface (CLI) use the following configuration, all keys are required YAML Key Description cli Type: string Full path to the CyberArk CLI executable Default: \"\" app-id Type: string Application id of the secret holder Default: \"\" safe Type: string Safe containing the secret Default: \"\" folder Type: string Folder containing the secret Default: \"\" object Type: string The object the secret is associated with Default: \"\" The following example will retrieve a CyberArk secret using the command line interface: variables: credentials: cyberark-cli: cli: /full/path/to/clipasswordsdk app-id: my-appid safe: my-safe folder: my-folder object: my-object Copy CyberArk REST API To retrieve secrets using the CyberArk REST API there must be a http key containing the HTTP configuration. The http key contains these sub-keys, only url is required: YAML key Description url Type: String URL to request data from, this key is required Default: none tls_config Type: YAML properties Use the TLS configuration properties headers Type: YAML map Request headers The following example will retrieve a secret using the CyberArk REST API, skipping server certificate verification: variables: credentials: cyberark-api: http: url: https://hostname/AIMWebService/api/Accounts?AppID=myAppID&Query=Safe=mySafe;Object=myObject tls_config: insecure_skip_verify: true Copy New Relic CLI Obfuscation Important We recommend using any of the supported secrets providers instead of the simple obfuscation when possible. See our guidelines below to define environment variables to avoid having the obfuscation key in configuration files. Tip Infrastructure Agent 1.14.0 or above is required You can use the New Relic CLI obfuscate command to obscure sensitive information in the infrastructure agent or any on-host integration configuration file. Steps: Install the New Relic CLI on any host (it can be your development host). Run the CLI obfuscate command in order to generate the obfuscated value: newrelic agent config obfuscate --value '<plain_text_config_value>' --key '<obfuscation_key>' Copy Copy the result of the cli command into the text argument in the obfuscated section as shown in the examples below. YAML key Description key Type: String The string used when obfuscating the clear-text value using New Relic CLI Default: none secret Type: String The output of the newrelic-cli command Default: none Integrations configuration example The following example will allow retrieving the Nginx user and password that has been obfuscated using the New Relic CLI: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: obfuscated: key: 'random_key_used_in_cli' secret: 'obscured_output_from_cli' instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true Copy It's recommended to use environment variables for the obfuscation arguments as shown in the example below: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: obfuscated: key: {{OBFUSCATION_KEY}} secret: {{OBFUSCATION_TEXT}} instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true Copy Agent configuration example This example allows retrieving a string that contains the proxy details (user, password and host): variables: obfuscated_proxy: obfuscated: key: 'random_key_used_in_cli' secret: 'obscured_output_from_cli' proxy: ${obfuscated_proxy} Copy",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostConditions directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your main.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add main.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform.

      "body": "Renders a table with a fixed header and rows. The table implements the following features: Flexible layout: table headers accept a variety of sizes to enable fluid and fixed layouts. You can find more information on how to customize your columns checking TableHeaderCell. Sorting: items passed can be internally sorted by the table according to the current sorting state of the table. You can find more information about sorting by checking TableHeaderCell. Row selection: rows can be selected through checkboxes on the right hand side. You can find more information in the selected prop. Row actions: contextual actions can be triggered per row, enabling users to achieve functionality over them. You can find more information on how to add them in TableRow. Custom pre-defined cells: some very common patterns for cells (entity title, metrics, etc.) are already provided by the platform, so that you only need to return it as part of your row. Virtualization: cells are only rendered if they are shown on screen. This enables the table to work with a large dataset with almost no performance penalty. Usage import { Table } from 'nr1' Copy Examples Props ariaLabelstring Provide an accessibility label that describes the purpose of the table, e.g. \"All entities\". children(node|function)[] Contents of the table. Table can only contain as children <TableHeader> and a function returning <TableRow>s. classNamestring Appends class names to the component. Should be used only for positioning and spacing purposes. compactboolean DEFAULT false Establishes whether the table should render in compact mode (compact mode has narrower rows). In general, use the standard mode, since compact is reserved for data representation, e.g. in a dashboard. itemsany[] DEFAULT [] The items to be used when rendering. They are required when rendering items with a render callback. Each item can have any structure and type possible, and will the corresponding one will be provided when rendering each element list. mainColumnnumber DEFAULT 0 Column containing the main data identifying the row. Often the first column (index 0) is the relevant one, but actions (like favorites) could be placed before it. onLoadMorefunction Callback fired when more items must be loaded. This happens when you're lazy loading the items and the items that are about to render cannot be found in the items array. This callback should be used to fetch/load the missing items from the backend or other sources. The returned Promise should be resolved once item data has finished loading. It will be used to determine when to refresh the list with the newly-loaded data. This callback may be called multiple times in reaction to a single scroll event. function ( cursor : Cursor // Items to load. ) onSelectfunction Function called when the user clicks over a row checkbox. It is called with the event of the checkbox, as well as with an object containing the item representing the row, its index in the items array passed to the table, and the items themselves. When the user selects or unselects the header checkbox (select / unselect all), the callback will be called once for every item, representing individual clicks over each row. The header checkbox state is automatically controlled by the table. function ( event : React.ChangeEvent, selectedItem : SelectedCallbackArgument ) rowCountnumber Number of rows. By default it's equal to length of array passed in the items prop. You should specify the rowCount when you know the total number of items but you want to lazy load them while scrolling. selectedfunction Function that returns whether a row is selected. It needs to return a boolean representing the state of the row. It is called with an object containing the item representing the row, its index in the items array passed to the table, and the items themselves. function ( item : SelectedCallbackArgument ) => boolean selectionTypeenum DEFAULT Table . SELECTION_TYPE . BULK Sets the selection mode of the Table. Use it along with onSelect and selected props to determine which row is checked by the user. Table.SELECTION_TYPE.BULK displays checkboxes per each row, along with a checkbox in the header to select all items. When an item is selected, header actions become available. Table.SELECTION_TYPE.SINGLE doesn't display checkboxes, the user picks a row by just clicking on it. Though not enforced in the component, the selected callback should return true only for one item. Check the examples of the component to see how it works. <One of Table.SELECTION_TYPE.BULK , Table.SELECTION_TYPE.SINGLE , > spacingTypeenum[] Spacing property. Spacing is defined as a tuple of zero to four values, which follow the same conventions as CSS properties like margin or padding. To omit a value, use SPACING_TYPE.OMIT. <Array of <One of Table.SPACING_TYPE.EXTRA_LARGE , Table.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE , Table.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM , Table.SPACING_TYPE.NONE , Table.SPACING_TYPE.OMIT , Table.SPACING_TYPE.SMALL , > > styleobject Inline style for custom styling.

If left empty, make sure you pass title so that users get a reference about the data the column shows. classNamestring Appends class names to the component. onClickfunction Callback fired any time the user clicks on the header. When clicked, sorting information (and the next sorting state) will be passed as the second parameter. Use it rather than computing it yourself. function ( event : React.MouseEvent, sortingData : Object ) sortableboolean DEFAULT false Whether the column is sortable. This means that the up and down arrows will be shown, side to the heading text. Sorting is a controlled component interface, you are in charge of listening for the sorting event and applying the sorting to the corresponding column, by changing its sortingOrder prop. sortingFunctionfunction Method for sorting rows. The default method will usually do the right thing (alphabetical ordering for text, numerical ordering for numbers and boolean grouping), but if needed this can be overridden. The function takes two parameters (a and b) and has to return a negative number if a is considered to appear before b, a positive one if it's considered to appear after, and zero if both values are identical. Each of the objects passed to the callback contains the value for the given row (i.e. the result of calling value over the row), the row item (as item), the index of the row (as index) and all the items in the items array (as items). Generally you will compare rows using a.item and b.item. function ( a : object, b : object ) => number sortingOrdernumber DEFAULT Number . MAX_SAFE_INTEGER Establishes the sorting order. A lowest number indicates a highest sorting priority, meaning that 0 will be the first column sorted, and if two items are identical, we will use column 1 and so on. Columns that do not have an explicit sorting order are used after all columns that do have it, and they are applied in order of appearance. sortingTypeenum DEFAULT TableHeaderCell . SORTING_TYPE . NONE Establishes the sorting for the column. Columns are sorted based on the element returned by the value prop. <One of TableHeaderCell.SORTING_TYPE.ASCENDING , TableHeaderCell.SORTING_TYPE.DESCENDING , TableHeaderCell.SORTING_TYPE.NONE , > styleobject Inline style for custom styling. testIdstring Adds a data-test-id attribute. Use it to target the component in unit and e2e tests. titlestring Establishes the title of the cell. This is used for tooltip purposes, when the width of the column is small enough to not show the entire heading. Defaults to the stringified version of the provided children. valuefunction Function that is used to extract the raw value representing a column. The raw value may be a boolean (e.g. if you render a checkbox), a number (if you render a metric) or text for others. It is called with an object containing the item representing the row, its index in the items array passed to the table, and the items themselves. This function is used for sorting the table (by the given value) as well as for the heuristics of 'fit-content' widths. widthstring DEFAULT 1fr Represents the width of the column. It is always a string, and it can be of one of the following types: 'fit-content': the column will take the minimum required space to allocate all items in the column. For virtualized lists, a heuristic will be used to avoid rendering all cells. 'YYpx': where YY is a number, represents the width of the column in pixels. 'YY%': where YY is a number, represents the width of the column in percentage, relative to the size of the available space where the table is being rendered. 'YYfr': where YY is a number, it represents a fraction of the available width. Fractions are proportional ones to others; for instance, a table with two columns (1fr and 2fr) will have the second column twice as large as the first one. If, after computing the widths, the overall size of the table does not cover the available space, all columns will be proportionally stretched to fit all available space.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. Tip To use CPMs and synthetic monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

Then use the Docker run command to start a new minion without the MINION_VSE_PASSPHRASE environment variable: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Kubernetes: Use the Helm upgrade command without the --set synthetics.minionVsePassphrase value: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion \\ -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY \\ Copy Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations > (select a private location). Clear the Enable verified script execution checkbox, then save. Other (legacy) If you are not using containerized private minions, do the following to enable verified script execution. Be sure to record your passphrase in a secure place. In your web browser, navigate to the minion Overview page at https://MINION_IP_ADDRESS (for example, https://1.2.3.4). Select the pencil icon, then select Advanced settings (optional). Select the Verified script execution checkbox. Type a passphrase, then save. Record your passphrase in a secure place. Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations > (select a private location). Select the private location's ellipses icon, and click Edit. Enable verified script execution, then save. From the Synthetics UI, select a monitor assigned to that location. Then select Settings > General. From the list of private locations, select your location, type your passphrase, and save. Repeat steps 4 through 6 for each monitor you want to assign to your location. To change your passphrase or disable verified script execution, follow the same basic process to go to your minion's IP address and update its Advanced settings. Then go to one.newrelic.com to complete the process.",

      "body": "When we say auto-telemetry, we’re not talking about cars — we’re talking about automatically collecting telemetry data for your Kubernetes clusters. With our Pixie integration, you no longer have to manually instrument your clusters or change code. With one install command, you get observability into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Pixie, New Relic's open source observability tool for Kubernetes applications, collects telemetry data using eBPF, a virtual machine-like construct in the Linux kernel. eBPF makes it easy to collect similar data about your clusters and workloads as with traditional New Relic language agents, but now without needing to update your code. Live debugging with Pixie shows a service graph listing the namespaces and the node that are available on the current cluster. Simply put, Auto-telemetry with Pixie offers the quickest option for getting observability into your Kubernetes services. Why it matters Our Pixie integration gives you the best of both worlds: Pixie’s fast and simple Kubernetes observability coupled with New Relic One’s incident correlation, intelligent alerting, and long-term retention. You’ll get visibility into HTTP services using golden signals, HTTP transactions, database transactions, distributed tracing, and JVM metrics. You can operate, debug, and scale your Kubernetes clusters based on the information you learn about how your clusters and services are running. Using the New Relic Explorer, you can see key metrics and events at every level, starting with the cluster, and diving down into namespaces, deployments, and pods. You can quickly spot anomalous behavior, and where it’s happening. And then dive deeper using embedded visualizations of your Pixie data. Quickly identify hot spots with Flamegraph. On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, answer questions like what SQL requests your app is making or which services are talking to each other. Install Auto-telemetry with Pixie Use our guided installation process to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie. This deploys Pixie with New Relic's Kubernetes integration on your cluster. You don't need to do any further configuration or installation to start using Pixie. If you want to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie on multiple clusters, re-run the guided install for each additional cluster. Before you begin Review this Pixie data security overview for actions to take to secure your data. Make sure you have sufficient memory: Pixie requires 2Gb of memory per node. Install from the beginning of the guided install process Open our New Relic One guided install. Select the account you want to use for the guided install, and click Continue. Note: if you have a single account, you won't see this option. Select Kubernetes and then continue with step one in the next section. Install from the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file If you arrived in the guided installation process by following a link from Pixie or from within New Relic, your steps begin here. Select the account and cluster for the install. If needed, select a namespace. Important Currently, Pixie performs best on clusters with up to 100 nodes (exceeding 100 nodes can lead to excessive memory usage and scripts failing to run). Friendly reminder: autoscaling can quickly drive up your node numbers. If Pixie is already running on your cluster, expand the Advanced options section and select the appropriate check box. We strongly recommend enabling Pixie auto update to maintain the latest Pixie version. Click Continue. Select the data you want to gather, observe, and debug, and click Continue. On the Choose install method page, copy the Helm command that's provided, and then run it on your command line. Helm installs a bundle containing the New Relic infrastructure agent, an integration to gather Prometheus metrics and Kubernetes events, and the Pixie integration. The deployment takes a few minutes to complete. To see the status of the install to the cluster, run kubectl get pods -n newrelic. Click Continue to open the Listening for data page. When you get the message, See your data, click Kubernetes Cluster Explorer to see your cluster. Note that Auto-telemetry with Pixie might restart after installation. This is caused by the auto update feature. Explore your cluster In the cluster explorer, you can get a quick overview of the nodes in your cluster, including CPU, memory, and storage, as well as the status of each pod (healthy, warning, or critical). You can also find out what services are running in each container, their latency, throughput, and error rate. For more information about using the cluster explorer, see Navigate the Kubernetes cluster explorer. Tip Containers might be listed for up to four hours after they get decommissioned. You can query the Pixie data in New Relic One and create dashboards for at-a-glance monitoring. Find the data model and sample queries here. Investigate usage spikes with Flamegraph Debugging is orders of magnitude easier when you can quickly see what your application is doing. Flamegraph, a Pixie always-on visualization, requires no instrumentation, redeploying, or recompiling. It works for compiled languages - Go, C+, Rust, to name a few. Flamegraph tells you in a glance what functions your application is spending time on, and where you have hot spots. Flamegraph is especially useful for hierarchical resource use, like disk usage and CPU utilization. For more information on how to read Flamegraph, see the Pixie documentation. Debug live On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, run PxL scripts — scripts written in Pixie's PxL language — to view live data captured through eBPF. Select the script drop-down and then select a script to run in the tab. (For best results, select a time range that is recent in the time picker.) Scripts enable you to debug: Traffic in multiple formats: HTTP and HTTPs (including encrypted), DNS, Postgres, MySQL, Cassandra, Redis (currently supporting SQL and HTTP in beta) Kubernetes services and their throughput, error rate, and latency statistics Service maps to learn which services are talking to each other Network traffic maps to learn which nodes are talking to each other JVM data If you don't find the script you need, you can write your own PxL scripts. Find more information about available scripts in Pixie's open source repo.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostConditions directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your main.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add main.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. Terragrunt is a thin wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state. In this guide, you will use Terragrunt to generate your Terraform configurations, create files with Terragrunt, and reuse the Terragrunt configuration to manage multiple environments. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic Infrastructure agent for your host. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: You will also need to install Terragrunt to follow this guide: bash Copy $ brew install terragrunt To follow the examples in this guide, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 6 Create a new configuration Terragrunt is a wrapper that provides extra tooling for your Terraform configurations. In the next steps, you will create a new configuration using Terragrunt, Terraform, and New Relic. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terragrunt-config && cd terragrunt-config In the new directory, create a terragrunt.hcl file, create a ./src directory, and create a ./environments directory: bash Copy $ touch terragrunt.hcl $ mkdir src $ mkdir environments Inside of your environments folder, create a folder named dev. In the ./src directory, create a main.tf and provider.tf files: bash Copy $ mkdir environments/dev $ touch src/main.tf $ touch src/provider.tf In the provider.tf file add the appropriate Terraform and New Relic provider configuration information: terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } Copy In the main.tf add a New Relic alert policy named DemoPolicy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Copy In the ./environments/dev directory create a new file named terragrunt.hcl bash Copy $ cd ./environments/dev/ $ touch terragrunt.hcl Within the dev folder update the terragrunt.hcl file by adding the following include statement. The include statement tells Terragrunt to use any .hcl confgiuration files it finds in parent folders. include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } Copy Next, add a Terraform block to provide Terragrunt with a Terraform source reference. terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Now you need to configure the provider with your New Relic account details. You will need your New Relic user API key and account ID. provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you have a single account: The account ID is displayed on the API keys page. If your organization has multiple accounts: From one.newrelic.com, select Entity explorer and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page. Tip Documentation about the New Relic provider is provided on the Terraform doc site. Update the provider.tf file to define the New Relic account variables that will help keep the Terraform configuration dynamic. variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy In your terminal, change directories to the environments/dev folder and run the command terragrunt init: bash Copy $ terragrunt init Terraform init sets up a bit of context, sets up environment variables, and then runs terraform init. You will see the following output: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. [terragrunt] [/Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev] 2021/02/02 13:30:31 Copying lock file [output] from /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev/.terragrunt-cache/e-PoBgWhdv3v8QGOtDQxS_WeYu4/ 69zjIFUfApJiUt8gFmi-6-dcPe8/.terraform.lock.hcl to /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy $ terragrunt plan Terragrunt starts to run but pauses to ask for the inputs to the New Relic account variables added to the provider.tf file. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2/02 13:32:08 Running command: terraform plan var.newrelic_account_id Enter a value: Interrupt received. Exit the terragrunt plan process with CTRL+C . In the environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl file, add an inputs block to provide the values for your New Relic account variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy The updated terragrunt.hcl only has the include, terraform, and inputs block include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Now, when you run terragrunt plan, Terragrunt will provide the input block's values, no longer prompting the command line for values. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Run terragrunt apply. After Terraform finishes process, check your New Relic account for the new Demo Policy. Step 2 of 6 Adding to your configuration Now that you have a basic New Relic configuration created, add configurations built in the Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides in this step. Tip If you haven't done the previous developer guides, you can copy the configurations for this section from the Terragrunt Intro Github Repo. Update the main.tf to include the additional terraform configurations. Update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy You have added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. To clone the module from GitHub, run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply. After Terraform is done processing, You will see your Demo Policy now has two conditions in your New Relic account and one alert channel attached. Step 3 of 6 Using your Environment as a Terragrunt Variable Using Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you are running to the name of the data you are creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create a new input for env_name inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy in the main.tf file add a new variable for 'env_name' variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Using string interpolation, add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks. resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to the configuration name. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Currently, the environment variable name is hardcoded into the root terragrunt.hcl file. You want to avoid having your variables hardcoded, using a terragrunt built-in function will pass the value. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use the path_relative_to_include() built-in function and pass the value has the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output, the env_name variable will have the entire ./environments/dev/ path. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Next, update the terragrunt.hcl to only include 'dev' as the env_name variable. Adding a locals block creates a local variable, using the replace built-in function will remove the unwanted parts of the relative path, and update the inputs block to use the local variable. locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output the env_name variable will now have 'dev:' added. Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Step 4 of 6 Storing the State Remotely At the moment, the state file is local. The next steps will update your Terraform configurations to remove the local state file and use a file stored remotely in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, various state files will need to be store in separate S3 buckets, not to override each other. Terragrunt allows you to generate files on the fly. Adding the remote_state block into the root level terragrunt.hcl file, you will generate a new file named backend.tf. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"my-terraform-state\" key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true } } Copy After adding the remote_state block, you will need to give the configuration for the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state. Tip To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Now, update the remote_state block to provide your S3 bucket and update the key to use the local environment variable created previously. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Next, run terragrunt plan. If you look in the Amazon S3 bucket, you will see a folder named envs. Within the envs folder is a directory called devs containing terraform.tfstate file. Tip To see the files created by Terragrunt, look inside of the ./environments/dev directory. There is a hidden directory named terragrunt-cache. Within the terragrunt-cache directory, you will see the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Step 5 of 6 Creating a New Environment Now that you have a working configuration for your dev environment, you will create a new environment reusing the dev configurations in the next steps. In the environments directory, create a new folder names nonprod. In the nonprod folder, create a new terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl In the nonprod terragrunt.hcl file copy over the configuration from the environment terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you are using a different account for your nonprod environment, you can update the inputs with a new New Relic account ID and API key. Inside of your nonprod directory, run terragrunt init then run terragrunt apply. In the output, you will see Terraform has created a new set of resources. The new resources should have the nonprod name prefixed. Step 6 of 6 Terragrunt has created two environments, but there is no difference between them other than the name. Adding variables in the configurations allows your configurations to be more dynamic. In the next steps, you will add variables to your configurations. In the main.tf add new variables for the Host Conditions modules cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage values: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy In the main.tf update the HostConditions module values to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Run terragrunt plan. In the output, the HostConditions values have changed to use the variable defaults. Next, you want to pass the values into your environment configurations by adding the inputs block variables. In the nonprod/terragrunt.hcl file, add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy Run terragrunt apply. In your New Relic account, you will see a new policy with configurations changed based on the environment. Conclusion Congratulations! You've used Terragrunt to generate your New Relic configurations and manage multiple environments. Review the Terragrunt Intro Example, New Relic Terraform provider documentation, and Terragrunt quick start to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "New Relic One has some basic UI functions that are widely available across the platform. Understanding these features will help you find and analyze your data more easily. Observe your platform New Relic One gives you full access to the data from all the entities in your stack. Go to the New Relic Explorer at one.newrelic.com to see a full list of entities, identify overall behaviors, filter them to locate sources of performance issues, or plan improvements for your system. Search accounts and entities Access Quick find clicking the button at the top right corner of the New Relic One UI. Some details about your search: You can search across all your New Relic accounts with cross-account access. Entities that cease to exist are available in search for eight days. If your organization has multiple accounts, use the account picker at the top left corner to select accounts. Use chart and query features You can add most charts to a new or existing dashboard. Here are some query and chart features available across all or most of the platform: If you want to... Do this... Start querying your data Mouse over Browse data and select metrics, events, logs, or traces for a direct access to any of those types of data. Also, at the top of any UI page, select Query your data to access the data explorer and query builder. View a chart's query For some charts, you can view the NRQL query used to generate that chart. This can help you understand a chart better or use it as the basis for a new query. Choose time range Drag across a section of a chart to zoom in on that time range. Or, use the time picker in the top right corner of the UI to select pre-set time ranges or set a custom one. View chart details Mouse over a chart to see a pop-up with more detail. For some charts, selecting a point on the chart will take you to a UI page with more information about that metric. Hide or return chart elements To hide or unhide a displayed chart element, select that element's name below the chart. The chart display will adjust to reflect the absence or presence of that element. Share with teammates Here are some options for sharing New Relic UI pages and visualizations. If you want to... Do this... Share UI pages and dashboards To share an entire New Relic UI page, click Share near the top of the UI to copy the URL. Share charts If New Relic charts are built with NRQL queries, they have a menu that exposes various options, including sharing options like Get as image and Get chart link. Some notes about sharing: The person you share with may not have access to view the data from that account. To solve that, someone on your team with New Relic user management abilities must add that person to the account. If someone can't access a custom dashboard, it may be that it is set to private. Read more about dashboard permissions. Some sharing options have associated time ranges, which may impact later viewings of it. For example, if you use a chart's Get chart link option and that chart is set to 'Last 30 minutes', when viewed it will show the last 30 minutes, not the time range displayed when it was shared. To share a specific time range, you must select that time range in the UI. Smooth navigation: Customize your bar and access the shortcuts Select the edit icon at the right end of the navigation bar to customize your view. Home, Explorer, Browse data, Dashboards, and Alerts & AI are fixed, but you can favorite up to six more elements to display on the bar as well. The rest will go on the More group. Navigation shortcuts are a faster way to find entities and apps that are relevant to you. Mouse over any menu item for quick access to your favorite entities, those you recently visited, or just to search without having to navigate to a specific section. If you click on an entity, you can choose to open it in the same browser tab or in a new one. Adjust account and user settings To adjust account settings and user preferences, and to get support and docs links, use the account dropdown, located at the top right of the UI, beside your user name.",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced query builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating browser, mobile, and synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's query builder or the GraphQL API. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use query builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How to modify existing entity types or create new ones How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic which matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. Tip For more information on how to modify existing entity types or create new ones please refer to our Entity Synthesis documentation. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you are aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: allows you to configure your Nerdlet and write to your Nerdlet's URL state.",

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced query builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating browser, mobile, and synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's query builder or the GraphQL API. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use query builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How to modify existing entity types or create new ones How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic which matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. Tip For more information on how to modify existing entity types or create new ones please refer to our Entity Synthesis documentation. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you are aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

Some details about your search: You can search across all your New Relic accounts with cross-account access. Entities that cease to exist are available in search for eight days. If your organization has multiple accounts, use the account picker at the top left corner to select accounts. Use chart and query features You can add most charts to a new or existing dashboard. Here are some query and chart features available across all or most of the platform: If you want to... Do this... Start querying your data Mouse over Browse data and select metrics, events, logs, or traces for a direct access to any of those types of data. Also, at the top of any UI page, select Query your data to access the data explorer and query builder. View a chart's query For some charts, you can view the NRQL query used to generate that chart. This can help you understand a chart better or use it as the basis for a new query. Choose time range Drag across a section of a chart to zoom in on that time range. Or, use the time picker in the top right corner of the UI to select pre-set time ranges or set a custom one. View chart details Mouse over a chart to see a pop-up with more detail. For some charts, selecting a point on the chart will take you to a UI page with more information about that metric. Hide or return chart elements To hide or unhide a displayed chart element, select that element's name below the chart. The chart display will adjust to reflect the absence or presence of that element. Share with teammates Here are some options for sharing New Relic UI pages and visualizations. If you want to... Do this... Share UI pages and dashboards To share an entire New Relic UI page, click Share near the top of the UI to copy the URL. Share charts If New Relic charts are built with NRQL queries, they have a menu that exposes various options, including sharing options like Get as image and Get chart link. Some notes about sharing: The person you share with may not have access to view the data from that account. To solve that, someone on your team with New Relic user management abilities must add that person to the account. If someone can't access a custom dashboard, it may be that it is set to private. Read more about dashboard permissions. Some sharing options have associated time ranges, which may impact later viewings of it. For example, if you use a chart's Get chart link option and that chart is set to 'Last 30 minutes', when viewed it will show the last 30 minutes, not the time range displayed when it was shared. To share a specific time range, you must select that time range in the UI. Smooth navigation: Customize your bar and access the shortcuts Select the edit icon at the right end of the navigation bar to customize your view. Home, Explorer, Browse data, Dashboards, and Alerts & AI are fixed, but you can favorite up to six more elements to display on the bar as well. The rest will go on the More group. Navigation shortcuts are a faster way to find entities and apps that are relevant to you. Mouse over any menu item for quick access to your favorite entities, those you recently visited, or just to search without having to navigate to a specific section. If you click on an entity, you can choose to open it in the same browser tab or in a new one.

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced query builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating browser, mobile, and synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's query builder or the GraphQL API. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use query builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "New Relic One has some basic UI functions that are widely available across the platform. Understanding these features will help you find and analyze your data more easily. Observe your platform New Relic One gives you full access to the data from all the entities in your stack. Go to the New Relic Explorer at one.newrelic.com to see a full list of entities, identify overall behaviors, filter them to locate sources of performance issues, or plan improvements for your system. Search accounts and entities Access Quick find clicking the button at the top right corner of the New Relic One UI. Some details about your search: You can search across all your New Relic accounts with cross-account access. Entities that cease to exist are available in search for eight days. If your organization has multiple accounts, use the account picker at the top left corner to select accounts. Use chart and query features You can add most charts to a new or existing dashboard. Here are some query and chart features available across all or most of the platform: If you want to... Do this... Start querying your data Mouse over Browse data and select metrics, events, logs, or traces for a direct access to any of those types of data. Also, at the top of any UI page, select Query your data to access the data explorer and query builder. View a chart's query For some charts, you can view the NRQL query used to generate that chart. This can help you understand a chart better or use it as the basis for a new query. Choose time range Drag across a section of a chart to zoom in on that time range. Or, use the time picker in the top right corner of the UI to select pre-set time ranges or set a custom one. View chart details Mouse over a chart to see a pop-up with more detail. For some charts, selecting a point on the chart will take you to a UI page with more information about that metric. Hide or return chart elements To hide or unhide a displayed chart element, select that element's name below the chart. The chart display will adjust to reflect the absence or presence of that element. Share with teammates Here are some options for sharing New Relic UI pages and visualizations. If you want to... Do this... Share UI pages and dashboards To share an entire New Relic UI page, click Share near the top of the UI to copy the URL. Share charts If New Relic charts are built with NRQL queries, they have a menu that exposes various options, including sharing options like Get as image and Get chart link. Some notes about sharing: The person you share with may not have access to view the data from that account. To solve that, someone on your team with New Relic user management abilities must add that person to the account. If someone can't access a custom dashboard, it may be that it is set to private. Read more about dashboard permissions. Some sharing options have associated time ranges, which may impact later viewings of it. For example, if you use a chart's Get chart link option and that chart is set to 'Last 30 minutes', when viewed it will show the last 30 minutes, not the time range displayed when it was shared. To share a specific time range, you must select that time range in the UI. Smooth navigation: Customize your bar and access the shortcuts Select the edit icon at the right end of the navigation bar to customize your view. Home, Explorer, Browse data, Dashboards, and Alerts & AI are fixed, but you can favorite up to six more elements to display on the bar as well. The rest will go on the More group. Navigation shortcuts are a faster way to find entities and apps that are relevant to you. Mouse over any menu item for quick access to your favorite entities, those you recently visited, or just to search without having to navigate to a specific section. If you click on an entity, you can choose to open it in the same browser tab or in a new one. Adjust account and user settings To adjust account settings and user preferences, and to get support and docs links, use the account dropdown, located at the top right of the UI, beside your user name.",

      "body": "Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account and Node.js installed on your machine. See Setting up your development environment for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git $ cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application. Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID $ npm install # Install dependencies $ nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, you should see a Create a table launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet subdirectory and open the index.js file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component. Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows. As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells. The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done!

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Tip Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

Search accounts and entities Access Quick find clicking the button at the top right corner of the New Relic One UI. Some details about your search: You can search across all your New Relic accounts with cross-account access. Entities that cease to exist are available in search for eight days. If your organization has multiple accounts, use the account picker at the top left corner to select accounts. Use chart and query features You can add most charts to a new or existing dashboard. Here are some query and chart features available across all or most of the platform: If you want to... Do this... Start querying your data Mouse over Browse data and select metrics, events, logs, or traces for a direct access to any of those types of data. Also, at the top of any UI page, select Query your data to access the data explorer and query builder. View a chart's query For some charts, you can view the NRQL query used to generate that chart. This can help you understand a chart better or use it as the basis for a new query. Choose time range Drag across a section of a chart to zoom in on that time range. Or, use the time picker in the top right corner of the UI to select pre-set time ranges or set a custom one. View chart details Mouse over a chart to see a pop-up with more detail. For some charts, selecting a point on the chart will take you to a UI page with more information about that metric. Hide or return chart elements To hide or unhide a displayed chart element, select that element's name below the chart. The chart display will adjust to reflect the absence or presence of that element. Share with teammates Here are some options for sharing New Relic UI pages and visualizations. If you want to... Do this... Share UI pages and dashboards To share an entire New Relic UI page, click Share near the top of the UI to copy the URL. Share charts If New Relic charts are built with NRQL queries, they have a menu that exposes various options, including sharing options like Get as image and Get chart link. Some notes about sharing: The person you share with may not have access to view the data from that account. To solve that, someone on your team with New Relic user management abilities must add that person to the account. If someone can't access a custom dashboard, it may be that it is set to private. Read more about dashboard permissions. Some sharing options have associated time ranges, which may impact later viewings of it. For example, if you use a chart's Get chart link option and that chart is set to 'Last 30 minutes', when viewed it will show the last 30 minutes, not the time range displayed when it was shared. To share a specific time range, you must select that time range in the UI. Smooth navigation: Customize your bar and access the shortcuts Select the edit icon at the right end of the navigation bar to customize your view. Home, Explorer, Browse data, Dashboards, and Alerts & AI are fixed, but you can favorite up to six more elements to display on the bar as well. The rest will go on the More group. Navigation shortcuts are a faster way to find entities and apps that are relevant to you. Mouse over any menu item for quick access to your favorite entities, those you recently visited, or just to search without having to navigate to a specific section. If you click on an entity, you can choose to open it in the same browser tab or in a new one.

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced query builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating browser, mobile, and synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's query builder or the GraphQL API. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use query builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How to modify existing entity types or create new ones How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic which matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. Tip For more information on how to modify existing entity types or create new ones please refer to our Entity Synthesis documentation. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you are aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload. Select Save filter for this workload. Use the API You can query, create, and update workloads with our NerdGraph API.",

Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

Search accounts and entities Access Quick find clicking the button at the top right corner of the New Relic One UI. Some details about your search: You can search across all your New Relic accounts with cross-account access. Entities that cease to exist are available in search for eight days. If your organization has multiple accounts, use the account picker at the top left corner to select accounts. Use chart and query features You can add most charts to a new or existing dashboard. Here are some query and chart features available across all or most of the platform: If you want to... Do this... Start querying your data Mouse over Browse data and select metrics, events, logs, or traces for a direct access to any of those types of data. Also, at the top of any UI page, select Query your data to access the data explorer and query builder. View a chart's query For some charts, you can view the NRQL query used to generate that chart. This can help you understand a chart better or use it as the basis for a new query. Choose time range Drag across a section of a chart to zoom in on that time range. Or, use the time picker in the top right corner of the UI to select pre-set time ranges or set a custom one. View chart details Mouse over a chart to see a pop-up with more detail.

Do this... Share UI pages and dashboards To share an entire New Relic UI page, click Share near the top of the UI to copy the URL. Share charts If New Relic charts are built with NRQL queries, they have a menu that exposes various options, including sharing options like Get as image and Get chart link. Some notes about sharing: The person you share with may not have access to view the data from that account. To solve that, someone on your team with New Relic user management abilities must add that person to the account. If someone can't access a custom dashboard, it may be that it is set to private. Read more about dashboard permissions. Some sharing options have associated time ranges, which may impact later viewings of it. For example, if you use a chart's Get chart link option and that chart is set to 'Last 30 minutes', when viewed it will show the last 30 minutes, not the time range displayed when it was shared. To share a specific time range, you must select that time range in the UI. Smooth navigation: Customize your bar and access the shortcuts Select the edit icon at the right end of the navigation bar to customize your view. Home, Explorer, Browse data, Dashboards, and Alerts & AI are fixed, but you can favorite up to six more elements to display on the bar as well. The rest will go on the More group. Navigation shortcuts are a faster way to find entities and apps that are relevant to you. Mouse over any menu item for quick access to your favorite entities, those you recently visited, or just to search without having to navigate to a specific section. If you click on an entity, you can choose to open it in the same browser tab or in a new one.

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced query builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating browser, mobile, and synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's query builder or the GraphQL API. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use query builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How to modify existing entity types or create new ones How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic which matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. Tip For more information on how to modify existing entity types or create new ones please refer to our Entity Synthesis documentation. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you are aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

Observe your platform New Relic One gives you full access to the data from all the entities in your stack. Go to the New Relic Explorer at one.newrelic.com to see a full list of entities, identify overall behaviors, filter them to locate sources of performance issues, or plan improvements for your system. Search accounts and entities Access Quick find clicking the button at the top right corner of the New Relic One UI. Some details about your search: You can search across all your New Relic accounts with cross-account access. Entities that cease to exist are available in search for eight days. If your organization has multiple accounts, use the account picker at the top left corner to select accounts. Use chart and query features You can add most charts to a new or existing dashboard. Here are some query and chart features available across all or most of the platform: If you want to... Do this... Start querying your data Mouse over Browse data and select metrics, events, logs, or traces for a direct access to any of those types of data. Also, at the top of any UI page, select Query your data to access the data explorer and query builder. View a chart's query For some charts, you can view the NRQL query used to generate that chart. This can help you understand a chart better or use it as the basis for a new query. Choose time range Drag across a section of a chart to zoom in on that time range. Or, use the time picker in the top right corner of the UI to select pre-set time ranges or set a custom one. View chart details Mouse over a chart to see a pop-up with more detail. For some charts, selecting a point on the chart will take you to a UI page with more information about that metric. Hide or return chart elements To hide or unhide a displayed chart element, select that element's name below the chart. The chart display will adjust to reflect the absence or presence of that element. Share with teammates Here are some options for sharing New Relic UI pages and visualizations. If you want to... Do this... Share UI pages and dashboards To share an entire New Relic UI page, click Share near the top of the UI to copy the URL. Share charts If New Relic charts are built with NRQL queries, they have a menu that exposes various options, including sharing options like Get as image and Get chart link. Some notes about sharing: The person you share with may not have access to view the data from that account. To solve that, someone on your team with New Relic user management abilities must add that person to the account. If someone can't access a custom dashboard, it may be that it is set to private. Read more about dashboard permissions. Some sharing options have associated time ranges, which may impact later viewings of it. For example, if you use a chart's Get chart link option and that chart is set to 'Last 30 minutes', when viewed it will show the last 30 minutes, not the time range displayed when it was shared. To share a specific time range, you must select that time range in the UI. Smooth navigation: Customize your bar and access the shortcuts Select the edit icon at the right end of the navigation bar to customize your view. Home, Explorer, Browse data, Dashboards, and Alerts & AI are fixed, but you can favorite up to six more elements to display on the bar as well. The rest will go on the More group. Navigation shortcuts are a faster way to find entities and apps that are relevant to you. Mouse over any menu item for quick access to your favorite entities, those you recently visited, or just to search without having to navigate to a specific section. If you click on an entity, you can choose to open it in the same browser tab or in a new one. Adjust account and user settings To adjust account settings and user preferences, and to get support and docs links, use the account dropdown, located at the top right of the UI, beside your user name.",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced query builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating browser, mobile, and synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's query builder or the GraphQL API. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use query builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How to modify existing entity types or create new ones How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic which matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. Tip For more information on how to modify existing entity types or create new ones please refer to our Entity Synthesis documentation. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you are aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users on our original account/user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020 and haven't migrated your users to the new model, your users are on our original account/user model (and not the New Relic One model). If you're an admin and want to see if you have users on the original model: If you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Updates about our new account/user model In July of 2020, we released a new account/user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more older customers to the new model. Some older customers are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this: Click the account dropdown, click Account settings, and then click Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) and full user upgrades Note that billing-related aspects of your count of full users only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. To control how basic users upgrade to become full users, from the Users and roles UI you can select Access requests. You have two options: Automatic approval: With this option, basic users can automatically upgrade to be full users. This option allows your users to more easily troubleshoot problems. Require review: With this option, your admins get a notification when basic users request an upgrade and must upgrade them first. You can approve them either from the notification email or from the user's entry in the Users and roles UI. For more about user type, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Depending on access request settings, basic users can either upgrade themselves to be full users or request upgrade access from admins. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit a user's type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Insights, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads.

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that each require their own type of API key to use. This resource describes our API keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. Manage API keys in UI Here's a direct link to the API keys UI page. To find this from the New Relic UI: From the account dropdown, select API keys. Overview of API keys The table below summarizes our available API keys and their uses. Important Some keys are able to be used by more than one API. If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. Key type What it's for Where to access User key (Also known as a \"personal API key\") Used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints (dependent on user permissions). API keys UI License key Allows ingestion of data from APM agents, the infrastructure agent, and some other data-ingest APIs. API keys UI Insights insert key (Also known as a \"Insert key\") Allows ingestion of events via HTTPS request from our metric, log, trace, and event APIs and the tools that use those APIs. Go to the API keys UI and click Insights insert key. Browser key Allows ingestion of browser monitoring data. API keys UI Mobile key (aka \"mobile app token\") Allows mobile monitoring data to be sent to New Relic. See Mobile app token. REST API key Note: we recommend using the user key instead because it has fewer limitations. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Go to the API keys UI and click REST API key. Admin API key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. For more information, see Admin key and User key below. API keys UI (will appear as user keys) Insights query key (aka \"Query key\") This key allows use of the Insights query API. Note: we now recommend using NerdGraph to query New Relic data. Go to the API keys UI and click Insights query key. User key New Relic user keys (previously referred to as \"personal API keys\") are required for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API), which allows you to query most New Relic data and do some types of configuration. User keys also let you use our REST API, with restrictions based on your permissions. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a user key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select User. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key. In the Notes field, add relevant details about the key. Click Create. Edit a user key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the user key you want to edit, click ... and select Edit. Make your changes and click Update key. Delete a user key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the user key you want to delete, click ... and select Delete. Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. Tip In December 2020, user keys supplanted Admin API keys. For details, see Admin API key. License key New Relic license keys allow the ingestion of data from APM agents, the infrastructure agent, and some other data-ingest APIs. If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required or recommended. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a license key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select License. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key. In the Notes field, add relevant details about the key. Click Create. Edit a license key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the license key you want to edit, click ... and select Edit. Make your changes and click Update key. Delete a license API key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the license key you want to delete, click ... and select Delete. Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. Important You can't manage or delete an original license key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Browser key The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a browser key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select Browser. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key. In the Notes field, add relevant details about the key. Click Create. Edit a browser key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the browser API key you want to edit, click ... and select Edit. Make your changes and click Update key. Delete a browser key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the browser API key you want to delete, click ... and select Delete. Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. Important You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. You can use a REST API key with our REST API and the API Explorer. For accounts that have sub-accounts, each sub-account must use its own REST API key. Requirements: Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. Activate or change REST API key Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Click Regenerate REST API key. Click (Show key) to view your account's new REST API key. Copy your account's REST API key to use with New Relic's REST API. View REST API keys To view REST API keys: Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Click (Show key) to view your account's new REST API key. Delete REST API key To delete your account's REST API key: Before you delete an API key, make sure you have the correct account or sub-account. Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Select the delete icon for the REST API key. Confirm the deletion by typing DELETION IS FOREVER in the text field. Select Delete. Insights insert key The Insights insert key (aka the \"Insert key\") is required for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. Generate an Insights insert key Go to the API keys UI and select Insights insert keys. Next to the Insert keys heading, select the button. A cURL command containing your insert key will appear, as well as NRQL query field. Edit the NRQL query field. Add comments in the Notes field if desired. Click Save your notes. Edit or delete an Insights insert key Go to the API keys UI and select Insights insert keys. Under Insert Keys, find the key you want to modify. Select Edit or Delete. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. Generate an Insights query key You must have access to the UIs you plan to query and the correct permissions in order to register or modify this key. Important Insights query keys are generated per account; they're not associated with a specific user. This means that any user in an account with access to a query key can use it. To register this key: Go to the API keys UI and select Insights query keys. Next to the Query Keys heading, select the button. A cURL command containing your insert key will appear, as well as NRQL query field. Edit the NRQL query field. Add comments in the Notes field if desired. Click Save your notes. Edit or delete an Insights query key To edit or delete this key: Go to the API keys UI page and select Insights query keys. Under Query Keys, find the key you want to modify. Select Edit or Delete. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily.",

      "body": "To read the relevant data from your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account, New Relic uses the Google Stackdriver API and also other specific services APIs. To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account. List of permissions Common permissions All integrations need the following permission: monitoring.timeSeries.list serviceusage.services.use Service-specific permissions For some GCP integrations, New Relic will also need the following permissions, mainly to collect labels and inventory attributes.

After the projects are linked, assign a Google Cloud custom role to the authorized account. Use New Relic NerdGraph to link Google Cloud projects to New Relic. This does not involve listing the viewable projects. However, you must know the id of the project you want to monitor.

Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period.

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remainig events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation . These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is the preferred API but if you are using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a New Relic APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. For more on faceting on multiple attributes, with some real-world examples, see this New Relic blog post. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions Here is a listing of the available functions in NRQL. The definitions below contain example NRQL queries. Aggregator functions Use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data in a NRQL query. Some helpful information about using aggregator functions: See the New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. Cohort analysis functions appear on the New Relic Insights Cohort analysis page. The cohort functions aggregate transactions into time segments. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "APM reports metric data in the form of metric timeslice data, and you can use NRQL to query, facet, and alert on this type of data. To explore timeslice data in the data explorer, see Explore your metrics. Why query metric timeslice data? We report metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data we call metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile, and browser (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Historically, this type of data couldn't be queried via our query language, NRQL. But now we are converting popular APM metrics from metric timeslice data to more-detailed dimensional metric data, which opens them up for querying via NRQL and via our NerdGraph API. This capability allows you to create powerful, in-depth custom visualizations of these important APM metrics. And this includes being able to query your custom metrics. Important You cannot query timeslice metrics in conjunction with dimensional metrics or event data. Any query involving newrelic.timeslice.value or an apm.* metric can only return APM metrics. Where to query? We recommend querying APM metric timeslice data using New Relic One query builder in advanced mode. This experience offers full NRQL functionality, and also gives helpful auto-complete suggestions and feedback on query errors. You can also: Make NRQL queries using our NerdGraph (GraphQL) API Alert on NRQL queries using NRQL alert conditions How to construct a query In APM, some charts have the option to view the NRQL query that generated that chart. This can be a good option for understanding how to query metrics. The NRQL query examined below is slightly modified from the error rate chart on the APM summary page. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE (entity.guid = 'AN_ENTITY_GUID') AND (transactionType = 'Web') SINCE 1 day ago TIMESERIES Copy Here is a breakdown of how the parts of this query work: Query segment What does it do? FROM Metric Metric is one of our core data types, and metric timeslice data is stored as this data type. For general tips on querying Metric data, see Metric query examples. SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) This math generates a count of errors out of a total count of transaction metrics. This query uses the converted metric names. Note that you can use other aggregator functions. WHERE (entity.guid = 'AN_ENTITY_GUID') You must specify at least one data source. You can select a single entity's GUID, as shown here, or you can select multiple sources. This query uses entity.guid, but you can also use appId or appName. AND (transactionType = 'Web') Sets the transaction type to web, meaning that background/non-web transactions won't be counted. SINCE 1 day ago Selecting a time range. TIMESERIES This optional clause displays the results in a time-based chart. For general information on NRQL syntax, including FROM, FACET, and TIMESERIES, see Intro to NRQL. For more queries, see Query examples. How metric timeslice data is converted The conversion of original APM metric timeslice metrics into dimensional metrics that are available for querying is an ongoing process and isn't complete. If you don't see a metric you're looking for in this section, see Generic queries. Here are how the original APM metric timeslice metrics are converted into dimensional metrics: Metric timeslice structure Dimensional metric structure APM metric names are represented as single strings of segments separated by forward slashes. For example, the “Datastore/statement/MySQL/users/select” metric represents the time spent in a select database operation on the users table. A single dimensional metric named apm.service.datastore.operation.duration represents the entire group of datastore metrics. This metric has three attributes representing the data values encoded into the metric name, datastoreType, table and operation: datastoreType = ‘MySQL’ table = ‘users’ operation = ‘select’ Some of the APM metrics made available as dimensional metrics: Metric name Description Attributes apm.service.cpu.usertime.utilization Time spent in user-mode code percentage apm.service.datastore.operation.duration Response time for database calls broken out by table operations datastoreType, table, operation apm.service.error.count Summary error count metrics transactionType apm.service.external.host.duration Response time for external calls broken out by external host name external.host apm.service.instance.count Count of the number of agent instances apm.service.memory.physical Process memory in MB apm.service.transaction.apdex Apdex scores per transaction transactionName, transactionType apm.service.transaction.duration Response time per transaction keyTransactionName, transactionName, transactionType apm.service.transaction.error.count Error counts per transaction keyTransactionName, transactionName, transactionType apm.service.transaction.external.duration External call response time by transaction type transactionType Learn how to see all metrics available to you. To understand more about the general structure of metric timeslice data, including some common examples, see Metric timeslice data. Attributes These attributes are available in addition to the metric-specific attributes listed in the APM metrics table above. Name Description appName The name of the application. appId The ID of the application. entity.guid The GUID of the application. host The host of the monitored process. host.bootId The ID of the boot of the host, if available. host.displayName The display_name of the host, if it was set in the agent. instanceName For Java APM agents, host : port metricName The name of the dimensional metric. metricTimesliceName The timeslice name of the legacy metric. scope (Optional) The timeslice name of the legacy metric that this metric is \"scoped\" to. Metrics with a scope belong to it--their measurements apply to the context of the metric named in the scope attribute. See below for examples. Generic queries with the newrelic.timeslice.value metric For metrics that haven't been converted to dimensional metrics, or for your own custom metrics, we have a dimensional metric named newrelic.timeslice.value. Important We recommend using the dimensional metrics from the table above when possible. When to use newrelic.timeslice.value? Given a metric timeslice name, you can query to see if it has a converted dimensional metric equivalent with this syntax: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE metricTimesliceName = 'Datastore/statement/MySQL/test/select' Copy If the only metric name returned is newrelic.timeslice.value, you'll need to query your data using this general approach. Get available metrics To get a list of available metrics for an application, you can use a query like: SELECT uniques(metricTimesliceName) FROM Metric WHERE appName='YOUR_APP_NAME' AND newrelic.timeslice.value IS NOT NULL Copy Facet on a wildcarded metric name segment Some metric timeslice names include attribute values as segments of the metric name. For example, our APM agents report metrics by tracking the duration of external calls using this format: External/{externalHost}/all Copy Here, {externalHost} represents the host name for the outbound network call. Here's an example of a generic newrelic.timeslice.value query of a custom metric that facets on a wildcarded metric segment: FROM Metric SELECT count(newrelic.timeslice.value) WHERE appName = 'MY APP' WITH METRIC_FORMAT 'Custom/Labels/{action}' TIMESERIES FACET action Copy In this query, {action} creates a temporary attribute, action, which is then used by FACET action. You can use any name you want, because it's only an attribute that exists for the duration of the query. You should choose a name that does not conflict with an existing attribute name. Recommended aggregator functions Recommended NRQL aggregator functions include: apdex average sum count rate uniques Query examples Some examples of querying metric timeslice data: Facet by multiple app names This query uses WHERE… IN to specify two applications and then facet by them: FROM Metric SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'Web throughput' WHERE appName IN ('MY_APPLICATION', 'MY_OTHER_APPLICATION') AND (transactionType = 'Web') FACET appName TIMESERIES Copy Throughput-per-minute rate This query displays requests-per-minute chart using the rate function: FROM Metric SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'HttpDispatcher requests_per_minute' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND (transactionType = 'Web') TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago Copy Facet by host-related attributes This query displays a requests-per-minute chart faceted by host name: FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.transaction.duration) as 'HttpDispatcher requests_per_minute' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND (transactionType = 'Web') TIMESERIES SINCE 3 hours ago FACET host LIMIT 20 Copy Instead of using host, you can facet by other host-related attributes, like host.bootId. Query of average duration of a metric This queries the average duration for a metric using average: FROM Metric SELECT average(apm.service.transaction.duration) as 'HttpDispatcher average duration' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND (transactionType = 'Web') TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago Copy Break down average time spent in a transaction by its component segments This query breaks down the average duration of single transaction (in this case, the show action in the UsersController of a Rails app named MY_APPLICATION) by the top 20 individual segments (database queries, external service calls, garbage collection time, etc.). It reproduces much of the \"Application breakdown\" chart as seen on the Transactions page In New Relic One for a service entity: FROM Metric SELECT average(newrelic.timeslice.value, exclusiveTime: true) as 'duration, seconds' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND scope = 'Controller/users/show' LIMIT 20 FACET metricTimesliceName TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago Copy",

You might introduce a bug in a release, overlook an edge case, or rely on a broken dependency. These issues, and others, can result in bad user experiences. In this guide, you: Use the open-source New Relic demo-deployer to spin up the infrastructure for Acme Telco Lite, a fictional company. This demo scenario is part of our Demo Catalog and will simulate real-world issues in a controlled, demo environment Use New Relic to understand those issues from the perspective of a Telco Lite developer Use the deployer to tear down the resources you create Welcome to Acme Telco Lite! Acme Telco Lite is a mock telecom business that maintains an eCommerce website for its customers. The site's architecture has eight, interconnected microservices, plus a simulator: The simulator isn't part of the Telco Lite infrastructure, but it is part of the demo deployment. It runs scenarios against the application to create web traffic and generate interesting data in New Relic. Set up your environment Before you begin, follow the Prerequisites guide from the deployer's GitHub repository for a detailed walkthrough of how to set up your environment. For this guide, you can choose between Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host your deployment. The guide steps you through: Installing Docker & pulling the demo-deployer image locally Creating a user config file containing credentials for New Relic and your cloud provider Downloading a .pem key file (if your cloud provider is AWS) Once you're all set up, deploy Acme Telco Lite. Deploy Telco Lite It's time to deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services using demo-deployer. Copy the url for the demo that corresponds to the cloud provider you chose when you set up your environment: AWS Telco Lite Demo Azure Telco Lite Demo GCP Telco Lite Demo Follow the Deployment guide in the Demo Catalog repository for a thorough explanation of how to use the deployer in a local Docker environment. When you run the deployment script, make sure to pass the url you copied for <demo-url>. Tip Since Telco Lite contains several services, the deployment can take over half an hour. When the deloyer is finished, you should see some output stating that the deployment was successful: bash Copy [INFO] Executing Deployment [✔] Parsing and validating Deployment configuration success [✔] Provisioner success [✔] Installing On-Host instrumentation success [✔] Installing Services and instrumentations success [INFO] Deployment successful!

View your services With your services running in the cloud, log in to New Relic and select APM from the top navigation to see how your services are holding up: Yikes! The alerts, high response times, and red-colored indicators suggest things aren't well. Use New Relic to diagnose these issues, which are simultaneously affecting your services: Issue 1: The Warehouse Portal has abnormally high response times Issue 2: Multiple services are raising error alerts Tip Don't worry if you don't see all the same alerts. The simulator triggers issues at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. Tear down Telco Lite When you're finished diagnosing all the issues effecting Telco Lite, follow the Teardown guide in the deployer's repository to tear down the services you created in your cloud provider. If you're still exploring, don't tear down your services, or you'll have to deploy them again later. Conclusion Congratulations, you're done! Throughout this tutorial, you: Used the demo-deployer to deploy Telco Lite to the cloud Used New Relic to investigate simulated issues in Telco Lite services Tore down all the infrastructural resources you created throughout this tutorial Hopefully, you learned a lot about using New Relic to investigate issues in your services.

      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why Telco-Warehouse Portal has slower-than-normal response times. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the high response times in your services. Step 1 of 6 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that the response time for Telco-Warehouse Portal is 43 seconds, much higher than the response times in other services: On the APM page, select the Telco-Warehouse Portal service name to see a summary of that service. The top graph in the summary view shows Web transactions time: You see several peaks, reaching almost 50,000 milliseconds—or 50 seconds! From this graph, you can actually gain a little more insight by toggling the colored components beneath the graph. For example, select Node.js: The graph changes to show only what the Node.js component contributes to the overall response time—less than 100 ms, in this example. Now, select Web external and deselect Node.js: External web traffic is the primary contributor to the high response times. That's a good start, but it doesn't tell the whole story. Next, dive deeper to find out which external service is causing the issue. Step 2 of 6 So, you know that Web external is the culprit of the high response times, but it's hard to tell why. External web traffic is all the requests made from your service to other services. This means you should look into what external requests that the warehouse portal makes to try to understand exactly what external service is the bottleneck. From the left-hand navigation, select Monitor > Distributed tracing: This view shows you requests to the warehouse portal. Select a request from the table at the bottom of the view to see a trace through that request: This trace shows that one external request contributes almost all of the total trace duration. Specifically, an external request to the Telco-Fulfillment Service contributes over 99% of the overall response time. This is good news! You own the fulfillment service, which means you can drill down for even more information. Select the offending row (called a span), and then select Explore this transaction: Step 3 of 6 You're now looking at the __main__:inventory_item transaction overview. Because you know that some part of this transaction is slow, you can use this overview to narrow your focus even further. Similar to how you modified the warehouse portal APM graph, you can look specifically at the components of this transaction to understand where the root cause of the slowness is. Another way to view this information is to scroll down to the Breakdown table in that same view: Function/__main__:inventory_item, a Python function, contributes over 99% of the overall response time. At this point, you know that Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow. You also know that the issue in the fulfillment service is local because over 99% of the request is spent in Python code, not external services. Navigate to the fulfillment service's summary page to look at the service as a whole, instead of this single transaction: Step 4 of 6 Scroll down on this view to familiarize yourself with the graphs it shows, such as Throughput and Error rate. At the bottom of the page, you can see a table with the fulfillment hosts. You can't currently drill into a specific host in the new UI (we're working on it), but you can in the old UI. Toggle Show new view to off and select the host link: Step 5 of 6 Now, you're looking at graphs in the infrastructure view for that service's host. Notice that CPU % has a lot of high spikes. Click and drag on the graph from the start of a spike to the end of it to narrow the timeslice to the period when CPU utilization goes up: If you compare this graph to the fulfillment service's transaction graph you looked at earlier, you'll see that soon after __main__:inventory_item begins executing, the CPU utilization of the host sharply rises to 100%! Step 6 of 6 Now, you understand the problem causing slow response times in the warehouse portal, but you don't know the extent of the issue. Using service maps, you can see all your services that depend on the fullfillment service. Navigate to the service map under APM > Telco-Fulfillment Service: This map shows you the fulfillment service's incoming and outgoing dependencies. Not only is Telco-Warehouse Portal dependent on the fullfillment service, but so is Telco-Web Portal! Select the web portal node to see that the fulfillment service also affects the web portal's response times: Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow The fulfillment service's Python function contributes over 99% of the response time Soon after the Python function starts executing, the host's CPU utilization spikes up to 100% The fulfillment service also affects Telco-Web Portal response times Now, as the developer behind the fulfillment service, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the CPU spikes. Congratulations! You can learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, you can tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

      "body": "With the data explorer you can navigate all your data visually, without any NRQL knowledge. Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Tip To use the data explorer and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces query interfaces to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From data explorer you can access query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Clone your dashboard You can clone your dashboard clicking the clone icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, cloned dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you clone a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the clone is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you clone it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Access the query builder to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. One of those options is adding the Java agent API's @Trace, @TraceLambda or @TraceByReturnType annotations to your application code. This document describes how to use annotations. Important To use annotations, you must modify the source code. If you can't or don't want to modify your source code, see Custom instrumentation for other instrumentation options. Configure your agent for annotations By default, the configuration setting enable_custom_tracing is set to true in the Java agent, which is the setting required for @Trace annotations to function. This setting is not included in the newrelic.yml by default. The only time you need to incorporate this setting into your configuration file is if you want to disable @Trace annotations altogether. To do this, set enable_custom_tracing: false (prefaced with two spaces) in the common stanza of your newrelic.yml. Make sure that newrelic-api.jar appears in your classpath as it contains all these annotations. @Trace Annotating a method with @Trace tells the Java agent that measurements should be taken for that method. To add a method call as a custom trace add @Trace annotations to your method. import com.newrelic.api.agent.Trace; ... @Trace public void run() { // background task } Copy Create a new transaction If transactions do not appear and you want to start a new transaction, include dispatcher=true with the @Trace annotation: @Trace (dispatcher=true) public void run() { // background task } Copy Add detail to your transactions If your transaction traces show large blocks of uninstrumented time and you want to include some more methods within the trace, you can use the @Trace annotation without parameters: @Trace protected void methodWithinTransaction() { // work } Copy Convert a transaction to a web request To make a background task report as a web browser transaction with a Java agent API call: In the method annotated with @Trace(dispatcher=true), call: NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(Request request, Response response) Copy The arguments are implementations of the Request and Response interfaces in newrelic-api.jar. Important Even if your Request and Response objects already are present, you still need to add this API call. Define your own @Trace annotation class If you define your own @Trace annotation class, there is no dependency on the newrelic-api.jar. To define the class: package com.test; @Target(ElementType.METHOD) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) public @interface Trace { public static final String NULL = \"\"; String metricName() default NULL; boolean dispatcher() default false; String tracerFactoryName() default NULL; } Copy Then, configure the agent to use this annotation in the common section of the newrelic.yml: class_transformer: trace_annotation_class_name: com.test.Trace Copy Properties for @Trace The @Trace annotation supports the following properties. dispatcher Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent will start a transaction when it reaches a method with this @Trace annotation if a transaction is not already in progress. If a transaction is already in progress, the method with this annotation will be included in the ongoing transaction, rather than starting a new one. If false (default), no metrics will be recorded if the agent has not started a transaction before the @Trace annotation is reached. For example: @Trace(dispatcher=true) Copy async Type: Boolean Default: false If true, this method is marked as asynchronous and the agent will trace this method if it linked to an existing transaction. For example: @Trace(async=true) Copy If false (default), the method is not marked as asynchronous. If other @Trace annotations are present and the method is not executing asynchronously, it will still be traced. metricName Type: String Default: (none) This property affects transaction traces and error reporting. By default, the metric name will include the class name followed by the method name. If you do not want class followed by method, then you can use this property to change the metric name. If you set the metricName, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\"), then the time spent in this method will appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. If you set the metricName in addition to the dispatcher, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\", dispatcher=true), then the transaction name will appear as YourMessageHere in the APM Transactions page but the time spent in this method will not appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. Here is an example: @Trace(metricName=\"YourMetricName\") Copy Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. excludeFromTransactionTrace Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the method will be excluded from the transaction trace. The agent will still collect metrics for the method. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true) Copy leaf Type: Boolean Default: false A leaf tracer has no child tracers. This is useful when you want all time attributed to the tracer, even if other trace points are encountered the tracer's execution. Database tracers often act as a leaf so that all time is attributed to database activity, even if instrumented external calls are made. Here is an example: @Trace(leaf=true) Copy If a leaf tracer does not participate in transaction traces, the agent can create a tracer with lower overhead. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true, leaf=true) Copy @TraceLambda If your transaction traces show large blocks of uninstrumented time and you want to include lambda expressions within the trace, you can use the @TraceLambda annotation without parameters: import com.newrelic.api.agent.TraceLambda; @TraceLambda class ClassContainingLambdaExpressions() { // work } Copy Lambda expressions become static methods of the containing class after compilation. By default, static methods within classes marked with the @TraceLambda annotation matching the annotations pattern will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Properties for @TraceLambda The @TraceLambda annotation supports the following properties. pattern Type: String Default: ^\\$?(lambda\\|anonfun)\\$(?\\<name\\>.*) If you set the pattern, as in @TraceLambda(pattern=\"YourPattern\"), then the marked classes method names will be matched against the regex pattern YourPattern. If matched the related method will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Here is an example: @TraceLambda(pattern=\"YourPattern\") Copy includeNonstatic Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the marked classes nonstatic methods will be eligible for assessment against the pattern for instrumentation. Here is an example: @TraceLambda(includeNonstatic=\"true\") Copy @TraceByReturnType To include methods with a particular return type within the trace, you can use the @TraceByReturnType annotation to mark a class passing the return types as a property. Methods in annotated classes that match one of the specified return types will be marked with the @Trace annotation. @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={Integer.class, String.class}) class ClassContainingMethods() { // ... } Copy Properties for @TraceByReturnType The @TraceByReturnType annotation supports the following properties. traceReturnTypes Type: List < Class> Default: empty list If you set the traceReturnTypes, as in @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={String.class}), then the marked classes method return types will be matched against the String.class. All matched methods will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Here is an example: @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={Integer.class, String.class}) class ClassContainingMethods() { public String doSomething() { // matches // ... } public Long somethingElse() { // does not match // ... } } Copy Performance considerations When the Java agent is present in the JVM, it will inject code on the annotated methods. The performance hit is negligible in heavyweight operations, such as database or webservice calls, but is noticeable in methods that are called frequently, such as an accessor called thousands of times a second. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to decreased performance and to a metric grouping issue.

      "body": "Improvements APIs This release adds a number of APIs that will allow you to instrument and get expanded visibility into frameworks, libraries, and any custom code that New Relic does not automatically instrument. In addition to instrumenting your web frameworks, you can also instrument calls to and from messaging systems, database calls, and external calls! By passing context about your code to the APIs, you will get the same reporting, including cross application tracing, that you get with New Relic’s built-in instrumentation. Solr This release adds support for Solr versions 5 and 6 (up to and including version 6.3.0). Fixes Fixes a bug that prevents an application from starting up when a JAX-RS annotated method contains more than 8 parameters. Fixes an issue that affected Spring and JAX-RS applications compiled with the Java 8 flag javac -parameters. The issue would cause the application to throw a java.lang.reflect.MalformedParametersException exception. Fixes bug that affected applications implementing JAX-RS endpoints using static methods. The agent now reports WildFly dispatcher name and version. Fixes a bug in which Queue Time could be misreported on the Overview page for customers injecting the X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start HTTP headers. This fix brings the Java Agent into compliance with the behavior of other New Relic Agents. Fixes an issue in which custom Hystrix Commands that are subclassed multiple times in Groovy cause an application to throw an exception on startup.",

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights (our original name for the feature that governed custom events) in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

Starting out with NerdGraph If you're new to NerdGraph and GraphQL, you may want to first read our Introduction to NerdGraph. If you’re already familiar with the dashboards API, you can read Create dashboards with NerdGraph. When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. Find the NerdGraph API explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Operations We have defined a granular GraphQL API that lets you execute different dashboard operations depending on their goal and scope. Dashboard CRUD operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes actor > entity() query Get dashboard operation. You can get all dashboard and widget data for a given dashboard entity GUID. dashboardCreate() mutation Create dashboard operation. You can create a dashboard attached to a specific account by specifying all its elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardUpdate() mutation Update dashboard operation. You can update an existing dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. You need to specify the complete, updated dashboard elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardDelete() mutation Delete dashboard operation. You can delete an existing dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. This operation executes a logical delete that lets you recover your dashboard. dashboardUndelete() mutation Undelete dashboard operation. You can recover a previously deleted dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. Dashboard page operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes dashboardUpdatePage() mutation Update dashboard page operation. You can update one page of an existing dashboard given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the complete, updated dashboard page elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardUpdateWidgetsInPage() mutation Update widgets operation. You can update a set of existing widgets of a dashboard page given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the set of widgets to be updated and their complete configuration. dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() mutation Add widgets operation. You can add a set of new widgets to a dashboard page given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the set of new widgets and their complete configuration. Other operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes dashboardCreateSnapshotUrl() mutation Create dashboard page snapshot operation. You can create a public URL for a given dashboard page entity GUID. The dashboard page can then be accessed in the form of a static snapshot in the resulting public URL. actor > dashboard > liveUrls() query List all live URLs operation. You can get the complete list of live URLs you have access to. A live URL is a mechanism that allows you to share dashboard pages and widgets publicly with up-to-date or live data. dashboardWidgetRevokeLiveUrl() mutation Revoke widget live URL operation. You can revoke a previously created live URL of a widget. As a result, the live URL will become unavailable to the public. Limits We have limited the values you can set to some of the dashboard properties. This allows us to keep dashboards in good shape while boosting their usability. Dashboard limits Limit Value Maximum number of pages in a dashboard 20 Maximum length of a dashboard name 255 Maximum length of a dashboard description 1024 Dashboard page limits Limit Value Maximum number of widgets in a dashboard page 40 Maximum length of a dashboard page name 255 Maximum length of a dashboard page description 1024 Widget limits Limit Value Maximum length of a widget title 255 Maximum number of entities linked to a widget 1 Maximum number of queries in a widget 20 Maximum layout column of a widget 12 Minimum layout column of a widget 1 Minimum layout row of a widget 1 Maximum layout width of a widget 12 Minimum layout width of a widget 1 Maximum layout height of a widget 8 Minimum layout height of a widget 1 Errors as first class citizens All dashboard mutations offer a way to ask for errors when being executed. This means that you can perform your dashboard mutations and check the response in order to detect expected potential issues. Every error has a type and a description to help you identify what’s the source of the problem. Errors as part of every mutation response mutation { dashboardMutation(guid: \"MY_EXISTING_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { mutationResult { result } errors { description type } } } Copy Keep in mind that these are expected errors that we are aware of in advance.

      "body": "This document provides examples of how to use New Relic NerdGraph to query and modify your cloud integration configuration data, including Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, you can also query NRQL data. These examples for querying cloud integration configuration data use GraphQL queries and mutations: Queries: requests that are intended to only fetch data Mutations: requests that create or update data on the server Requirements Before querying cloud integration data with NerdGraph, ensure you have: Followed the instructions to connect cloud integrations with New Relic. Created an API key. Access the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer To access the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Add any of the following examples. Query examples Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (no side effects). Queries in NerdGraph are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Available provider accounts This query returns a list of all provider accounts available in your infrastructure data. Depending on the provider, additional properties can be requested. For example, for GCP, you can also ask for the serviceAccountId property, which is needed when linking a new GCP project to New Relic. Anonymous: { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug ... on CloudGcpProvider { serviceAccountId } } } } } } Copy Named: query cloudProviders { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug } } } } } Copy Specific provider account information This query returns information about a specific provider account for your Amazon AWS integration. The properties id, name, slug are requested, along with a list of integrations available to be monitored. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { provider(slug: \"aws\") { id slug name services { id slug name } } } } } } Copy Specific integration data from a specific cloud provider This query returns information about a specific cloud service integration of a provider. In this example, the integration is the Amazon AWS ALB monitoring integration and the provider is AWS. The properties id, name, slug, and isAllowed are requested with the available configuration parameters. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { provider(slug: \"aws\") { service(slug: \"alb\") { id name slug isEnabled } } } } } } Copy List of enabled cloud accounts This query returns the list of cloud accounts enabled with your New Relic account. (Your cloud account associates your New Relic account and a specific provider account with your integration.) You can enable multiple cloud provider accounts in the same New Relic account, even with the same cloud provider. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccounts { id name createdAt provider { id name } } } } } } Copy Specific linked account data This query returns information about a linked account, including the properties name, providerId, and a list of the cloud integrations enabled for monitoring. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccount(id: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID>) { name provider { id name } integrations { id name createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Copy Enabled cloud integrations for all linked accounts This query returns all monitored integrations for all the provider cloud accounts. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccounts { name provider { id name } integrations { id name service { id name } createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Copy Specific cloud integration data for a specific linked account This query returns information about a specific integration from a specific linked account. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccount(id: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID>) { name provider { id name } integration(id: <INTEGRATION_ID>) { id name service { id name } createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Copy Mutation examples Mutations are requests that are intended to have side effects, such as creating or updating data on the server. Mutations require the keyword mutation and the name of the mutation. NerdGraph mutations are restricted to a subset of all possible mutations. Link an account This mutation allows linking cloud provider accounts to a New Relic account, creating one or more linked accounts. It can link one specific cloud provider account (for example aws) to the New Relic account or multiple cloud provider accounts to one New Relic account. Required: The parameter <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME> is required and cannot be empty. It must be unique in your New Relic account. Other parameters are specific to the provider (AWS, GCP, and Azure) and are also required. In the following sections, you can see which parameters are required for each provider account. After linking an account the createdAt and updatedAt values are equal. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accounts: { accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] azure: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] gcp: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } } Copy Link an Amazon AWS account This mutation links an Amazon AWS provider account to your New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, arn: <AWS_ROLE_ARN> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } } Copy Link an Amazon AWS account using CloudWatch Metric Streams This mutation links an Amazon AWS account sending data through CloudWatch Metric Streams to your New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, arn: <AWS_ROLE_ARN>, metricCollectionMode: PUSH }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } } Copy Link a Microsoft Azure account This mutation links a Microsoft Azure cloud subscription to the New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { azure: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, applicationId: <azure_application_id>, clientSecret: <azure_application_key>, tenantId: <azure_tenant_id>, subscriptionId: <azure_subscription_id> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } Copy Link a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project This mutation links a GCP project to the New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { gcp: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, projectId: <GCP_PROJECT_ID> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } Copy Rename one or more cloud accounts This mutation allows you to rename one or more linked provider accounts. The name parameter is required, cannot be empty, and must be unique within your New Relic account. mutation { cloudRenameAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: [ { id: <linked_cloud_account_id_1>, name: <new_provider_account_name> }, { id: <linked_cloud_account_id_2>, name: <new_provider_account_name> } ] ) { linkedAccounts { id name } } } Copy Enable an integration in a cloud account This mutation allows you to enable the monitoring of one or more specific cloud integrations in an existing cloud account. With this mutation, New Relic records data for the enabled integration from the provider account. For each provider account you have access to different input parameters, matching each available service. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug> : { <integration_slug>: [{ linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID>, <other_parameters> }] } } ) { integrations { id name integration { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Copy Enable an integration in multiple cloud accounts If you have many provider accounts linked, you can enable the same integration in the many cloud accounts at the same time. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug> : { <integration_slug> : [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_1> }, { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_2> } ] } } ) { integrations { id name integration { id name } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Copy Enable multiple integrations in multiple cloud accounts If you have multiple cloud accounts linked, you can also enable multiple integrations in multiple linked cloud accounts at the same time. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments to ask for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug_1>: { <integration_slug_1>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_1> } ] <integration_slug_2>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_2> } ] }, <provider_slug_2>: { <integration_slug_3>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_3>}, { linkedAccountId: <linked_cloud_account_id_4>} ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id name } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Copy Modify an integration's configuration (regions, polling intervals, etc.) This mutation also allows you to modify one or more cloud integrations and change one or more configuration parameters. Each service will have specific parameters that you can modify. For parameters of a type list (for example, awsRegion) supply the full list. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments to ask for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug>: { <integration_slug>: [{ linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID>, metricsPollingInterval: <new_polling_interval>, <parameter_1>: <value_1>, <parameter_N>: <value_N>, }] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { metricsPollingInterval, <parameter_1>, <parameter_N> } } errors { type message } } } Copy Disable (remove) an integration This mutation allows you to disable an integration and stop data collection for the specific cloud integration. mutation { cloudDisableIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { : { : [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { disabledIntegrations { id name authLabel provider { id } } errors { type message } } } Copy Unlink account This mutation allows you to unlink cloud provider accounts from New Relic account. Caution This action can not be undone. However, you can link the account again, but account history will still be lost. mutation { cloudUnlinkAccount ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID> } } ) { unlinkedAccounts { id name } errors { type message } } } Copy Enable an Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To enable an Amazon AWS integration: Send query to fetch account data Send a query to fetch data about the account, specifically available providers and already created provider accounts: { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug } linkedAccounts { name integrations { id name } } } } } } Copy Link AWS provider account Link an AWS provider account, if there is not one already linked or if you want to link another AWS account: Use your New Relic account identifier in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter. Provide a name for the provider account in the <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>. Include the ARN of the AWS role used to fetch data from your AWS account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, arn: <AWS_ROLE_ARN> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } errors { type message } } } Copy Enable Amazon AWS SQS integration Use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the provider account in the <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id name } } errors { type message } } } Copy Enable integration in multiple provider accounts If you have multiple accounts with the same provider account, you can enable the same integration in multiple provider accounts at the same time. Use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the provider accounts in the <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID_n> parameter value. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID_1> }, { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID_2>, configuration_param_1: value_1, configuration_param_2: value_2 } ] } } }) { integrations { id name service { id name } } errors { type message } } } Copy Change polling interval for Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To change the polling interval of an AWS integration: Update the polling interval To update the polling interval for an Amazon AWS SQS integration, use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the id of the linked provider account in the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value: mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws : { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID>, metricsPollingInterval: 300 } ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { metricsPollingInterval } } errors { type message } } } Copy Disable Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To disable an AWS integration: Disable the SQS integration Use your New Relic account identifier in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the linked cloud account the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value. mutation { cloudDisableIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs : [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { disabledIntegrations { id accountId name } errors { type message } } } Copy",

      "body": "The Insights Dashboard API is deprecated, but you can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to create and configure dashboards. If you are not migrating from the old Insights API, you can skip this and discover the new Dashboards API. Why a new dashboards API? Our Insights product, which was a way to query data and create charts and dashboards, has been deprecated and its set of features moved over to be a core part of the New Relic One platform. To learn more about this transition and new features, see the Insights to New Relic One migration guide. The Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated in July of 2021. Until then, if you are using Insights Dashboard API, you should attempt to switch over to using NerdGraph. Some details on this deprecation: You can continue to use your Insights insert API key with the Dashboards API, or you can create a new user API key (read more about API keys). Every user who wants to use NerdGraph needs their own user API key. The REST API for Insights queries is not affected by this change and won't be deprecated. For more information about which key to use with our APIs, see our documentation about . When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. Starting out with NerdGraph If you're new to NerdGraph and GraphQL, you may want to first read our Introduction to NerdGraph and some of Create dashboards with NerdGraph. The NerdGraph API explorer is located at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Operations mapping table The table below maps every Insights API operation to the new dashboards API. Insights API operation NerdGraph API query/mutation Notes List (GET) entitySearch() View a paginated list of dashboards that match the filter. Show (GET) entity() View an existing dashboard given its entity guid. Create (POST) dashboardCreate() Create a new dashboard. Update (PUT) dashboardUpdate() Update an existing dashboard given its entity guid. Delete (DELETE) dashboardDelete() Delete an existing dashboard given its entity guid. Dashboard properties mapping table For more information about all the fields in the new dashboards GraphQL schema, have a look at NerdGraph's GraphiQL explorer. The table below maps dashboard properties from the Insights API to the new dashboards API.

By using the NerdGraph API explorer, you can discover GraphQL types and fields, along with a brief explanation. We want to facilitate your migration from the Insights API to the new New Relic One dashboards API. Find below some examples that illustrate how the old REST endpoints map to the new GraphQL queries or mutations. List (GET) -> entitySearch query Dashboards in New Relic One embrace the concept of entity. They are now another entity in New Relic’s entity ecosystem. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. List all dashboard entities you have access to { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by name { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {name: \"My dashboard\"}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s email { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD, tags: {key: \"createdBy\", value: \"email@domain.com\"}}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s user id { actor { entitySearch(query: \"type ='DASHBOARD' and ownerId = '2357322'\") { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy Show (GET) -> entity query In order to get information on a dashboard, all you need is to provide its unique entity identifier or entity guid. Then you can access all the dashboard properties that you are interested in by adding them in the GraphQL query. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Get dashboard info given its entity guid { actor { entity(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { ... on DashboardEntity { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } } Copy Create (POST) -> dashboardCreate mutation Operations that mutate the state of the system are mutations in GraphQL APIs. You can create a dashboard by providing the required input for the dashboardCreate mutation. Although GraphQL APIs aim to be self-explanatory, Nerdgraph docs can help you with some information about the fields, like the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Create dashboard with two pages and two widgets per page mutation { dashboardCreate(accountId: 1, dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.markdown\" }, title: \"My markdown widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { text: \"#My markdown\" } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.billboard\" }, title: \"My billboard widget with thresholds\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" }], thresholds: [{ alertSeverity: WARNING, value: 650 }, { alertSeverity: CRITICAL, value: 1500 }] } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Update (PUT) -> dashboardUpdate mutation The dashboardUpdate mutation allows you to update an existing dashboard by providing the existing dashboard guid and the new configuration. Similarly to creating a dashboard, the mutation tries to be self-explanatory, but you can look up the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Update previously created dashboard to 1 page and 1 widget per page mutation { dashboardUpdate(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\" dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Delete (DELETE) -> dashboardDelete mutation The dashboardDelete mutation allows you to delete an existing dashboard by providing its entity guid. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Delete previously created dashboard mutation { dashboardDelete(guid:\"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { status errors { type description } } } Copy",

      "body": "This doc contains tutorials on how to use NerdGraph to programmatically manage some New Relic API keys. For general information about New Relic keys, see API keys. Overview of feature description You can use the API keys UI to create and manage keys. Alternatively, you can use NerdGraph's ApiAccess field to programmatically create and manage the following types of keys: User keys License keys, including: General license key (used for APM, infrastructure monitoring, more) Browser key (for browser monitoring) One common use case for this feature is the ability to create and manage license keys to let you rotate keys for security purposes. Note that you can't use this NerdGraph functionality to manage or delete your original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage the ones you've created. Notes about this functionality: All mutations can accept multiple keys as arguments, and will return details about successful changes and errors. See examples below for details. All mutations (create, update and delete) will result in an NrAuditEvent that can be queried for auditing purposes. For details, see Audit events. Regarding license keys: License keys are categorized by NerdGraph as ingest keys. This is because their main use is to allow data ingest. You can create up to 1,000 keys of each license key type, which allows for key rotation. You can't manage or delete original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage keys you've created. Before using examples Things to note before using these example queries: The examples below use license keys (aka ingest keys), but you can query user keys in similar ways, replacing the ingest-key-specific fields with user-key-specific fields. To understand the data structure, we recommend experimenting with queries using the GraphiQL explorer. You can also create, view, and delete user keys using the UI. Create keys You can create multiple keys in a single mutation, for multiple accounts and key types. Note that the mutation can return successfully created keys as well as any errors encountered trying to create keys. Example of creating a key: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {ingest: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ingestType: BROWSER, name: \"Browser Key\", notes: \"A note.\"}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Here's an example of using this query to create a user key: Create a user key To create a user key, you'd change the above query slightly, in the keys section: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {user: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, userId: YOUR_USER_ID}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Copy Update keys The update mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. mutation { apiAccessUpdateKeys(keys: {ingest: {keyId: KEY_ID, name: \"Updated name\", notes: \"A new note!\"}}) { updatedKeys { id key type name notes } errors { message } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Delete keys The delete mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. Deleted keys will no longer grant access to New Relic systems and will no longer be returned by queries to the API access GraphQL API. mutation { apiAccessDeleteKeys(keys: {ingestKeyIds: INGEST_KEY_ID}) { deletedKeys { id } errors { message } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Query keys You can access ingest and user keys by querying a single key or all keys, scoped to the actor. If querying for a single key, you must provide the key ID and type (INGEST or USER). Querying for multiple keys is done via a key search, which uses a mandatory types list and an optional scope to filter results. User keys belonging to other users will be obfuscated in the results. Single key example query: query { actor { apiAccess { key(id: INGEST_KEY_ID, keyType: INGEST) { key name type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } Copy Key search example query: query { actor { apiAccess { keySearch(query: {types: INGEST, scope: {ingestTypes: BROWSER}}) { keys { name key type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remainig events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation . These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is the preferred API but if you are using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "When we say auto-telemetry, we’re not talking about cars — we’re talking about automatically collecting telemetry data for your Kubernetes clusters. With our Pixie integration, you no longer have to manually instrument your clusters or change code. With one install command, you get observability into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads. No language agents required. Pixie, New Relic's open source observability tool for Kubernetes applications, collects telemetry data using eBPF, a virtual machine-like construct in the Linux kernel. eBPF makes it easy to collect similar data about your clusters and workloads as with traditional New Relic language agents, but now without needing to update your code. Live debugging with Pixie shows a service graph listing the namespaces and the node that are available on the current cluster. Simply put, Auto-telemetry with Pixie offers the quickest option for getting observability into your Kubernetes services. Why it matters Our Pixie integration gives you the best of both worlds: Pixie’s fast and simple Kubernetes observability coupled with New Relic One’s incident correlation, intelligent alerting, and long-term retention. You’ll get visibility into HTTP services using golden signals, HTTP transactions, database transactions, distributed tracing, and JVM metrics. You can operate, debug, and scale your Kubernetes clusters based on the information you learn about how your clusters and services are running. Using the New Relic Explorer, you can see key metrics and events at every level, starting with the cluster, and diving down into namespaces, deployments, and pods. You can quickly spot anomalous behavior, and where it’s happening. And then dive deeper using embedded visualizations of your Pixie data. Quickly identify hot spots with Flamegraph. On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, answer questions like what SQL requests your app is making or which services are talking to each other. Install Auto-telemetry with Pixie Use our guided installation process to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie. This deploys Pixie with New Relic's Kubernetes integration on your cluster. You don't need to do any further configuration or installation to start using Pixie. If you want to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie on multiple clusters, re-run the guided install for each additional cluster. Before you begin Review this Pixie data security overview for actions to take to secure your data. Make sure you have sufficient memory: Pixie requires 2Gb of memory per node. Install from the beginning of the guided install process Open our New Relic One guided install. Select the account you want to use for the guided install, and click Continue. Note: if you have a single account, you won't see this option. Select Kubernetes and then continue with step one in the next section. Install from the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file If you arrived in the guided installation process by following a link from Pixie or from within New Relic, your steps begin here. Select the account and cluster for the install. If needed, select a namespace. Important Currently, Pixie performs best on clusters with up to 100 nodes (exceeding 100 nodes can lead to excessive memory usage and scripts failing to run). Friendly reminder: autoscaling can quickly drive up your node numbers. If Pixie is already running on your cluster, expand the Advanced options section and select the appropriate check box. We strongly recommend enabling Pixie auto update to maintain the latest Pixie version. Click Continue. Select the data you want to gather, observe, and debug, and click Continue. On the Choose install method page, copy the Helm command that's provided, and then run it on your command line. Helm installs a bundle containing the New Relic infrastructure agent, an integration to gather Prometheus metrics and Kubernetes events, and the Pixie integration. The deployment takes a few minutes to complete. To see the status of the install to the cluster, run kubectl get pods -n newrelic. Click Continue to open the Listening for data page. When you get the message, See your data, click Kubernetes Cluster Explorer to see your cluster. Note that Auto-telemetry with Pixie might restart after installation. This is caused by the auto update feature. Explore your cluster In the cluster explorer, you can get a quick overview of the nodes in your cluster, including CPU, memory, and storage, as well as the status of each pod (healthy, warning, or critical). You can also find out what services are running in each container, their latency, throughput, and error rate. For more information about using the cluster explorer, see Navigate the Kubernetes cluster explorer. Tip Containers might be listed for up to four hours after they get decommissioned. You can query the Pixie data in New Relic One and create dashboards for at-a-glance monitoring. Find the data model and sample queries here. Investigate usage spikes with Flamegraph Debugging is orders of magnitude easier when you can quickly see what your application is doing. Flamegraph, a Pixie always-on visualization, requires no instrumentation, redeploying, or recompiling. It works for compiled languages - Go, C+, Rust, to name a few. Flamegraph tells you in a glance what functions your application is spending time on, and where you have hot spots. Flamegraph is especially useful for hierarchical resource use, like disk usage and CPU utilization. For more information on how to read Flamegraph, see the Pixie documentation. Debug live On the Live debugging with Pixie tab, run PxL scripts — scripts written in Pixie's PxL language — to view live data captured through eBPF. Select the script drop-down and then select a script to run in the tab. (For best results, select a time range that is recent in the time picker.) Scripts enable you to debug: Traffic in multiple formats: HTTP and HTTPs (including encrypted), DNS, Postgres, MySQL, Cassandra, Redis (currently supporting SQL and HTTP in beta) Kubernetes services and their throughput, error rate, and latency statistics Service maps to learn which services are talking to each other Network traffic maps to learn which nodes are talking to each other JVM data If you don't find the script you need, you can write your own PxL scripts. Find more information about available scripts in Pixie's open source repo.",

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in the stream of data coming into New Relic. The stream of data that comes into New Relic is called a signal. You can control what part of the signal is alerted on through NRQL conditions. These NRQL condition alerts are processed by the streaming algorithm. The NRQL query provides the signal filter for all of your incoming data. Tip You can read more about the streaming alerts platform in this Explorers Hub post. Why it matters Alerts violations are easy when they're caused by a specific event happening, but trickier when looking for events not happening. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional offset delay allows for slower data to come through before it's processed. Once the aggregation window plus the offset time have elapsed, New Relic groups the aggregated data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation isn't triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation window A specific amount of time when the filtered data (or its absence) can accumulate in this window. Evaluation offset A time delay to ensure data points are placed in the correct aggregation window. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools you can use to more effectively alert on your streaming data, giving you greater control and reducing the number of false alerts notifications. They are: Loss of signal detection Gap filling Aggregation window duration customization Offset evaluation Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with None, the last value received, or a static value. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Aggregation window In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before using the aggregation function to evaluate the data. A longer aggregation window gives straggling data points more time to arrive before evaluating that data. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 1 second and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Offset evaluation For data that consistently takes longer to arrive, you can use offset evaluation to consistently delay the NRQL condition evaluation. Waiting longer increases accuracy, but also increases latency. The offset time value is the number of aggregation windows you want to use. The duration for each window is set in the Aggregation window field. For example, if your aggregation window is 1 minute and your Offset evaluation is 3, then a straggling data point will have about 3 minutes to arrive before it might be dropped. In other words, streaming alerts will always keep 3 aggregation windows in the queue, waiting 1 minute before evaluating each window and adding a new one. The current default is 3.",

Baseline alerting is useful for creating conditions that: Only notify you when data is behaving abnormally. Dynamically adjust to changing data and trends, including daily or weekly trends. In addition, baseline alerting works well with new applications when you do not yet have known behaviors. How it works When you choose a data source (for example, an APM metric) for a baseline condition, we'll use the past values of that data to dynamically predict the data's near-future behavior. The line of that predicted future behavior for that value is called a baseline. It appears as a dotted black line on the preview chart in the baseline condition UI. You'll use the baseline alert condition UI to: Adjust how sensitive the condition is to fluctuations in the data source. Set the behavior that will trigger a violation (for example: \"deviating for more than five minutes\"). Set whether you want the condition to check for upper violations, lower violations, or both.

Set the preview chart to either 2 days or 7 days of displayed data. (Not applicable for NRQL alert conditions.) Use the slider bar to adjust the Critical threshold sensitivity, represented in the preview chart by the light gray area around the baseline. The tighter the band around the baseline, the more sensitive it is and the more violations it will generate. Optional: You can create a Warning threshold (the darker gray area around the baseline). For NRQL alerts, see the allowed types of NRQL queries. If the alert condition applies to multiple apps, you can select a choice from the dropdown above the chart to use different metrics. (Not applicable for NRQL alert conditions.) Faceted baseline conditions NRQL alerts conditions support faceted baselines. In the chart legend, click a time series to scope it to a single facet. Once you've run a faceted NRQL query for a baseline condition, you can scope your results to a single baseline. Click Return to full timeseries list to go back to seeing all your facets. The single time series shows the baseline, threshold band, and one or more violation regions, if there are any. Baseline rules and settings Here are some details about how the UI works: Rules governing creation of baseline The algorithm for baseline conditions is mathematically complex. Here are some of the major rules governing its predictive abilities: Data trait Baseline rules Age of data On initial creation, the baseline is calculated using between 1 to 4 weeks of data, depending on data availability and baseline type. After its creation, the algorithm will take into account ongoing data fluctuations over a long time period, although greater weight is given to more recent data. For data that has only existed for a short time, the baseline will likely fluctuate a good deal and not be very accurate. This is because there is not yet enough data to determine its usual values and behavior. The more history the data has, the more accurate the baseline and thresholds will become. Consistency of data For metric values that remain in a consistent range or that trend slowly and steadily, their more predictable behavior means that their thresholds will become tighter around the baseline. Data that is more varied and unpredictable will have looser (wider) thresholds. Regular fluctuations For shorter-than-one-week cyclical fluctuations (such as weekly Wednesday 1pm deployments or nightly reports), the baseline algorithm looks for these cyclical fluctuations and attempts to adjust to them. Baseline direction: select upper or lower ranges You can choose whether you want the condition to violate for behavior that goes above the baseline (\"upper\") or that goes below the baseline (\"lower\"), or that goes either above or below. You choose these with the Baseline direction selector. Example use cases for this: You might use the Upper setting for a data source like error rate, because you generally are only concerned if it goes up, and aren't concerned if it goes down. You might use the Lower setting for a data source like throughput, because sudden upward fluctuations are quite common, but a large sudden downswing would be a sign of a problem. Here are examples of how large fluctuations in your data would be treated under the different baseline direction settings. The red areas represent violations. Preview chart: select 2 or 7 days When setting thresholds, the preview chart has an option for displaying Since 2 days ago or Since 7 days ago. These selections are not the time period used to compute the baseline; they are only the time range used for a preview display. For more about the time range used to calculate the baseline, see the algorithm rules.",

      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why some services are raising alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the error alerts in your services. Step 1 of 8 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal have opened critical violations for high error percentages: Tip If you don't see all the same alerts, don't worry. The simulated issues happen at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. The deployment has created an alert condition for cases where a service's error percentage rises above 10% for 5 minutes or longer. A critical violation means that the service's conditions violate that threshold. Begin your investigation by selecting the Telco-Web Portal service name. Step 2 of 8 You're now on the web portal's APM summary page. The top graph, Web transactions time, shows you the service's response times. By default, it also displays periods of critical violation. On the right-hand side of the view, Application activity shows when violations opened and closed: From the left-hand navigation, select Events > Errors to learn more about the errors: At the bottom of the view, the Errors table shows you what errors occurred in the service along with number of times each error occurred. In this scenario, the only error in the service has the following message: bash Copy An error occurred during a downstream request to http://35.182.223.70:7001/api/inventory detail:response code 500 This is a helpful message that explains that the web portal made a request to another service, raised an error, and responded with a response code of 500, indicating an Internal server error. Since this message tells you that the error occurred while the web portal was making an outbound request, use distributed tracing to better understand the issue. Select Monitor > Distributed tracing from the left-hand navigation. Step 3 of 8 Distributed tracing provides end-to-end information about a request. In this case, you're looking for a request to the web portal that raised an error, so that you can better understand what happened during that request. Filter the table, by selecting the Errors column header twice, to order by descending counts: Select the first row in the table: This trace gives a lot of information about what happened with the request once the web portal received it. One of the things that the trace reveals is that the web portal made a GET request to Telco-Login Service and received an error. The trace indicates an error by coloring the text red. Select the row (called a span) to see more information about the request to the login service: Expand Error details to see the error message: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic Interesting! This message says that, at the time that the web portal made the GET request to the login service, the login service was not ready to accept traffic. Inspect the login service to dive further into the root cause of these cascading errors. Return to the APM page, and select Telco-Login Service. Step 4 of 8 Notice that the APM summary for Telco-Login Service has similar red flags to the ones in the web portal: Web transactions time has a red error indicator, and Application activity shows critical violations. More than that, the times that the errors occurred in both services match up (around 10:53 AM, in this example). Step 5 of 8 Web transactions time, in APM, shows that requests to the login service spend all their time in Java code. So, in the left-hand navigation, open Monitor > JVMs: Java Virtual Machines, or JVMs, run Java processes, such as those used by the login service. This view shows resource graphs for each JVM your service uses. Change the timeslice to look at data for the last 3 hours, so you can get a better idea of how the service has been behaving: Notice, in Heap memory usage, that the line for Used Heap rises consistently over 30 minute intervals. About two-thirds of the way through each interval, the line for Committed Heap (the amount of JVM heap memory dedicated for use by Java processes) quickly rises to accommodate the increasing memory demands. This graph indicates that the Java process is leaking memory. Step 6 of 8 Your Java process is leaking memory, but you need to understand the extent of the leak's impact. Navigate to the login service's host infrastructure view to dive a little deeper. First, go to the Telco-Login Service summary page and turn off Show new view: Then, scroll to the bottom of the page, and select the host's name: Right now, you can only select the host's name from the old version of the UI (we're working on it). So, make sure you toggle off Show new view. In this infrastructure view, Memory Used % for Telco-Authentication-host consistently climbs from around 60% to around 90% over 30-minute intervals, matching the intervals in the JVM's heap memory usage graph: Therefore, the memory leak effects the login service's entire host. Click and drag on Memory Used % to narrow the timeslice to one of the peaks: Now, compare this graph with the login service's Errors graph to see how they relate. Step 7 of 8 Open New Relic in a new tab. From APM, select Telco-Login Service. Then, navigate to Events > Errors. By comparing these graphs, you see that the memory percentage reached its peak at 10:25 AM (in this example) and then dropped off. You also see that errors started occurring in the login service just after that, at 10:26 AM. The message for those errors is the same one you saw earlier: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic This suggests that the memory leaks cause the application to fail for a time. To understand the error a bit more, select the error class from the table at the bottom of the view: The stack trace shows that the service raised an UnhandledException from a function called EnsureAppIsStarted: With the information you've collected so far, you can conclude that Telco-Login Service's Java code has a memory leak. Also, the login service restarts the application when it runs out of memory, and it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests while the app is restarting. You also know the login service is effecting the web portal, because that is what introduced you to this problem, but does the issue effect any other services? Step 8 of 8 Visualize service dependencies using service maps. First, navigate back to APM, and from Telco-Login Service, select Monitor > Service map: Both Telco-Web Portal and Telco-Warehouse Portal depend on Telco-Login Service. So, when the login service goes down, you start seeing errors in both portals. Extra Credit Use the same steps you used to investigate issues in the web portal to confirm there are issues in the warehouse portal. Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal raise alerts during critical violations The login service's Java processes leak memory When the login service's host, Telco-Authentication-host, runs out of memory, it restarts the login application While the login application is restarting, it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests When the web portal and the warehouse portal make requests to the login service while it's restarting, they receive errors and raise errors of their own Now, as a Telco Lite developer, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the memory leak. Congratulations! Learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the high response times in your services. Step 1 of 6 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that the response time for Telco-Warehouse Portal is 43 seconds, much higher than the response times in other services: On the APM page, select the Telco-Warehouse Portal service name to see a summary of that service. The top graph in the summary view shows Web transactions time: You see several peaks, reaching almost 50,000 milliseconds—or 50 seconds! From this graph, you can actually gain a little more insight by toggling the colored components beneath the graph. For example, select Node.js: The graph changes to show only what the Node.js component contributes to the overall response time—less than 100 ms, in this example. Now, select Web external and deselect Node.js: External web traffic is the primary contributor to the high response times. That's a good start, but it doesn't tell the whole story. Next, dive deeper to find out which external service is causing the issue. Step 2 of 6 So, you know that Web external is the culprit of the high response times, but it's hard to tell why. External web traffic is all the requests made from your service to other services. This means you should look into what external requests that the warehouse portal makes to try to understand exactly what external service is the bottleneck. From the left-hand navigation, select Monitor > Distributed tracing: This view shows you requests to the warehouse portal. Select a request from the table at the bottom of the view to see a trace through that request: This trace shows that one external request contributes almost all of the total trace duration. Specifically, an external request to the Telco-Fulfillment Service contributes over 99% of the overall response time. This is good news! You own the fulfillment service, which means you can drill down for even more information. Select the offending row (called a span), and then select Explore this transaction: Step 3 of 6 You're now looking at the __main__:inventory_item transaction overview. Because you know that some part of this transaction is slow, you can use this overview to narrow your focus even further. Similar to how you modified the warehouse portal APM graph, you can look specifically at the components of this transaction to understand where the root cause of the slowness is. Another way to view this information is to scroll down to the Breakdown table in that same view: Function/__main__:inventory_item, a Python function, contributes over 99% of the overall response time. At this point, you know that Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow. You also know that the issue in the fulfillment service is local because over 99% of the request is spent in Python code, not external services. Navigate to the fulfillment service's summary page to look at the service as a whole, instead of this single transaction: Step 4 of 6 Scroll down on this view to familiarize yourself with the graphs it shows, such as Throughput and Error rate. At the bottom of the page, you can see a table with the fulfillment hosts. You can't currently drill into a specific host in the new UI (we're working on it), but you can in the old UI. Toggle Show new view to off and select the host link: Step 5 of 6 Now, you're looking at graphs in the infrastructure view for that service's host. Notice that CPU % has a lot of high spikes. Click and drag on the graph from the start of a spike to the end of it to narrow the timeslice to the period when CPU utilization goes up: If you compare this graph to the fulfillment service's transaction graph you looked at earlier, you'll see that soon after __main__:inventory_item begins executing, the CPU utilization of the host sharply rises to 100%! Step 6 of 6 Now, you understand the problem causing slow response times in the warehouse portal, but you don't know the extent of the issue. Using service maps, you can see all your services that depend on the fullfillment service. Navigate to the service map under APM > Telco-Fulfillment Service: This map shows you the fulfillment service's incoming and outgoing dependencies. Not only is Telco-Warehouse Portal dependent on the fullfillment service, but so is Telco-Web Portal! Select the web portal node to see that the fulfillment service also affects the web portal's response times: Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow The fulfillment service's Python function contributes over 99% of the response time Soon after the Python function starts executing, the host's CPU utilization spikes up to 100% The fulfillment service also affects Telco-Web Portal response times Now, as the developer behind the fulfillment service, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the CPU spikes. Congratulations! You can learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, you can tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

      "body": "With the data explorer you can navigate all your data visually, without any NRQL knowledge. Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Tip To use the data explorer and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces query interfaces to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From data explorer you can access query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Clone your dashboard You can clone your dashboard clicking the clone icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, cloned dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you clone a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the clone is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you clone it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Access the query builder to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.12\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostConditions directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your main.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add main.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. Terragrunt is a thin wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state. In this guide, you will use Terragrunt to generate your Terraform configurations, create files with Terragrunt, and reuse the Terragrunt configuration to manage multiple environments. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic Infrastructure agent for your host. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: You will also need to install Terragrunt to follow this guide: bash Copy $ brew install terragrunt To follow the examples in this guide, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 6 Create a new configuration Terragrunt is a wrapper that provides extra tooling for your Terraform configurations. In the next steps, you will create a new configuration using Terragrunt, Terraform, and New Relic. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terragrunt-config && cd terragrunt-config In the new directory, create a terragrunt.hcl file, create a ./src directory, and create a ./environments directory: bash Copy $ touch terragrunt.hcl $ mkdir src $ mkdir environments Inside of your environments folder, create a folder named dev. In the ./src directory, create a main.tf and provider.tf files: bash Copy $ mkdir environments/dev $ touch src/main.tf $ touch src/provider.tf In the provider.tf file add the appropriate Terraform and New Relic provider configuration information: terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } Copy In the main.tf add a New Relic alert policy named DemoPolicy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Copy In the ./environments/dev directory create a new file named terragrunt.hcl bash Copy $ cd ./environments/dev/ $ touch terragrunt.hcl Within the dev folder update the terragrunt.hcl file by adding the following include statement. The include statement tells Terragrunt to use any .hcl confgiuration files it finds in parent folders. include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } Copy Next, add a Terraform block to provide Terragrunt with a Terraform source reference. terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Now you need to configure the provider with your New Relic account details. You will need your New Relic user API key and account ID. provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you have a single account: The account ID is displayed on the API keys page. If your organization has multiple accounts: From one.newrelic.com, select Entity explorer and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page. Tip Documentation about the New Relic provider is provided on the Terraform doc site. Update the provider.tf file to define the New Relic account variables that will help keep the Terraform configuration dynamic. variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy In your terminal, change directories to the environments/dev folder and run the command terragrunt init: bash Copy $ terragrunt init Terraform init sets up a bit of context, sets up environment variables, and then runs terraform init. You will see the following output: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. [terragrunt] [/Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev] 2021/02/02 13:30:31 Copying lock file [output] from /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev/.terragrunt-cache/e-PoBgWhdv3v8QGOtDQxS_WeYu4/ 69zjIFUfApJiUt8gFmi-6-dcPe8/.terraform.lock.hcl to /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy $ terragrunt plan Terragrunt starts to run but pauses to ask for the inputs to the New Relic account variables added to the provider.tf file. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2/02 13:32:08 Running command: terraform plan var.newrelic_account_id Enter a value: Interrupt received. Exit the terragrunt plan process with CTRL+C . In the environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl file, add an inputs block to provide the values for your New Relic account variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy The updated terragrunt.hcl only has the include, terraform, and inputs block include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Now, when you run terragrunt plan, Terragrunt will provide the input block's values, no longer prompting the command line for values. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Run terragrunt apply. After Terraform finishes process, check your New Relic account for the new Demo Policy. Step 2 of 6 Adding to your configuration Now that you have a basic New Relic configuration created, add configurations built in the Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides in this step. Tip If you haven't done the previous developer guides, you can copy the configurations for this section from the Terragrunt Intro Github Repo. Update the main.tf to include the additional terraform configurations. Update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy You have added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. To clone the module from GitHub, run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply. After Terraform is done processing, You will see your Demo Policy now has two conditions in your New Relic account and one alert channel attached. Step 3 of 6 Using your Environment as a Terragrunt Variable Using Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you are running to the name of the data you are creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create a new input for env_name inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy in the main.tf file add a new variable for 'env_name' variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Using string interpolation, add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks. resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to the configuration name. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Currently, the environment variable name is hardcoded into the root terragrunt.hcl file. You want to avoid having your variables hardcoded, using a terragrunt built-in function will pass the value. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use the path_relative_to_include() built-in function and pass the value has the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output, the env_name variable will have the entire ./environments/dev/ path. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Next, update the terragrunt.hcl to only include 'dev' as the env_name variable. Adding a locals block creates a local variable, using the replace built-in function will remove the unwanted parts of the relative path, and update the inputs block to use the local variable. locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output the env_name variable will now have 'dev:' added. Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Step 4 of 6 Storing the State Remotely At the moment, the state file is local. The next steps will update your Terraform configurations to remove the local state file and use a file stored remotely in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, various state files will need to be store in separate S3 buckets, not to override each other. Terragrunt allows you to generate files on the fly. Adding the remote_state block into the root level terragrunt.hcl file, you will generate a new file named backend.tf. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"my-terraform-state\" key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true } } Copy After adding the remote_state block, you will need to give the configuration for the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state. Tip To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Now, update the remote_state block to provide your S3 bucket and update the key to use the local environment variable created previously. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Next, run terragrunt plan. If you look in the Amazon S3 bucket, you will see a folder named envs. Within the envs folder is a directory called devs containing terraform.tfstate file. Tip To see the files created by Terragrunt, look inside of the ./environments/dev directory. There is a hidden directory named terragrunt-cache. Within the terragrunt-cache directory, you will see the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Step 5 of 6 Creating a New Environment Now that you have a working configuration for your dev environment, you will create a new environment reusing the dev configurations in the next steps. In the environments directory, create a new folder names nonprod. In the nonprod folder, create a new terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl In the nonprod terragrunt.hcl file copy over the configuration from the environment terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you are using a different account for your nonprod environment, you can update the inputs with a new New Relic account ID and API key. Inside of your nonprod directory, run terragrunt init then run terragrunt apply. In the output, you will see Terraform has created a new set of resources. The new resources should have the nonprod name prefixed. Step 6 of 6 Terragrunt has created two environments, but there is no difference between them other than the name. Adding variables in the configurations allows your configurations to be more dynamic. In the next steps, you will add variables to your configurations. In the main.tf add new variables for the Host Conditions modules cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage values: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy In the main.tf update the HostConditions module values to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Run terragrunt plan. In the output, the HostConditions values have changed to use the variable defaults. Next, you want to pass the values into your environment configurations by adding the inputs block variables. In the nonprod/terragrunt.hcl file, add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy Run terragrunt apply. In your New Relic account, you will see a new policy with configurations changed based on the environment. Conclusion Congratulations! You've used Terragrunt to generate your New Relic configurations and manage multiple environments. Review the Terragrunt Intro Example, New Relic Terraform provider documentation, and Terragrunt quick start to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Every time you deploy an application, you hope that it's efficient and error-free. The reality, however, is usually quite different. You might introduce a bug in a release, overlook an edge case, or rely on a broken dependency. These issues, and others, can result in bad user experiences. In this guide, you: Use the open-source New Relic demo-deployer to spin up the infrastructure for Acme Telco Lite, a fictional company. This demo scenario is part of our Demo Catalog and will simulate real-world issues in a controlled, demo environment Use New Relic to understand those issues from the perspective of a Telco Lite developer Use the deployer to tear down the resources you create Welcome to Acme Telco Lite! Acme Telco Lite is a mock telecom business that maintains an eCommerce website for its customers. The site's architecture has eight, interconnected microservices, plus a simulator: The simulator isn't part of the Telco Lite infrastructure, but it is part of the demo deployment. It runs scenarios against the application to create web traffic and generate interesting data in New Relic. Set up your environment Before you begin, follow the Prerequisites guide from the deployer's GitHub repository for a detailed walkthrough of how to set up your environment. For this guide, you can choose between Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host your deployment. The guide steps you through: Installing Docker & pulling the demo-deployer image locally Creating a user config file containing credentials for New Relic and your cloud provider Downloading a .pem key file (if your cloud provider is AWS) Once you're all set up, deploy Acme Telco Lite. Deploy Telco Lite It's time to deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services using demo-deployer. Copy the url for the demo that corresponds to the cloud provider you chose when you set up your environment: AWS Telco Lite Demo Azure Telco Lite Demo GCP Telco Lite Demo Follow the Deployment guide in the Demo Catalog repository for a thorough explanation of how to use the deployer in a local Docker environment. When you run the deployment script, make sure to pass the url you copied for <demo-url>. Tip Since Telco Lite contains several services, the deployment can take over half an hour.

Use New Relic to diagnose these issues, which are simultaneously affecting your services: Issue 1: The Warehouse Portal has abnormally high response times Issue 2: Multiple services are raising error alerts Tip Don't worry if you don't see all the same alerts. The simulator triggers issues at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. Tear down Telco Lite When you're finished diagnosing all the issues effecting Telco Lite, follow the Teardown guide in the deployer's repository to tear down the services you created in your cloud provider. If you're still exploring, don't tear down your services, or you'll have to deploy them again later. Conclusion Congratulations, you're done! Throughout this tutorial, you: Used the demo-deployer to deploy Telco Lite to the cloud Used New Relic to investigate simulated issues in Telco Lite services Tore down all the infrastructural resources you created throughout this tutorial Hopefully, you learned a lot about using New Relic to investigate issues in your services.

      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why some services are raising alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the error alerts in your services. Step 1 of 8 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal have opened critical violations for high error percentages: Tip If you don't see all the same alerts, don't worry. The simulated issues happen at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. The deployment has created an alert condition for cases where a service's error percentage rises above 10% for 5 minutes or longer. A critical violation means that the service's conditions violate that threshold. Begin your investigation by selecting the Telco-Web Portal service name. Step 2 of 8 You're now on the web portal's APM summary page. The top graph, Web transactions time, shows you the service's response times. By default, it also displays periods of critical violation. On the right-hand side of the view, Application activity shows when violations opened and closed: From the left-hand navigation, select Events > Errors to learn more about the errors: At the bottom of the view, the Errors table shows you what errors occurred in the service along with number of times each error occurred. In this scenario, the only error in the service has the following message: bash Copy An error occurred during a downstream request to http://35.182.223.70:7001/api/inventory detail:response code 500 This is a helpful message that explains that the web portal made a request to another service, raised an error, and responded with a response code of 500, indicating an Internal server error. Since this message tells you that the error occurred while the web portal was making an outbound request, use distributed tracing to better understand the issue. Select Monitor > Distributed tracing from the left-hand navigation. Step 3 of 8 Distributed tracing provides end-to-end information about a request. In this case, you're looking for a request to the web portal that raised an error, so that you can better understand what happened during that request. Filter the table, by selecting the Errors column header twice, to order by descending counts: Select the first row in the table: This trace gives a lot of information about what happened with the request once the web portal received it. One of the things that the trace reveals is that the web portal made a GET request to Telco-Login Service and received an error. The trace indicates an error by coloring the text red. Select the row (called a span) to see more information about the request to the login service: Expand Error details to see the error message: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic Interesting! This message says that, at the time that the web portal made the GET request to the login service, the login service was not ready to accept traffic. Inspect the login service to dive further into the root cause of these cascading errors. Return to the APM page, and select Telco-Login Service. Step 4 of 8 Notice that the APM summary for Telco-Login Service has similar red flags to the ones in the web portal: Web transactions time has a red error indicator, and Application activity shows critical violations. More than that, the times that the errors occurred in both services match up (around 10:53 AM, in this example). Step 5 of 8 Web transactions time, in APM, shows that requests to the login service spend all their time in Java code. So, in the left-hand navigation, open Monitor > JVMs: Java Virtual Machines, or JVMs, run Java processes, such as those used by the login service. This view shows resource graphs for each JVM your service uses. Change the timeslice to look at data for the last 3 hours, so you can get a better idea of how the service has been behaving: Notice, in Heap memory usage, that the line for Used Heap rises consistently over 30 minute intervals. About two-thirds of the way through each interval, the line for Committed Heap (the amount of JVM heap memory dedicated for use by Java processes) quickly rises to accommodate the increasing memory demands. This graph indicates that the Java process is leaking memory. Step 6 of 8 Your Java process is leaking memory, but you need to understand the extent of the leak's impact. Navigate to the login service's host infrastructure view to dive a little deeper. First, go to the Telco-Login Service summary page and turn off Show new view: Then, scroll to the bottom of the page, and select the host's name: Right now, you can only select the host's name from the old version of the UI (we're working on it). So, make sure you toggle off Show new view. In this infrastructure view, Memory Used % for Telco-Authentication-host consistently climbs from around 60% to around 90% over 30-minute intervals, matching the intervals in the JVM's heap memory usage graph: Therefore, the memory leak effects the login service's entire host. Click and drag on Memory Used % to narrow the timeslice to one of the peaks: Now, compare this graph with the login service's Errors graph to see how they relate. Step 7 of 8 Open New Relic in a new tab. From APM, select Telco-Login Service. Then, navigate to Events > Errors. By comparing these graphs, you see that the memory percentage reached its peak at 10:25 AM (in this example) and then dropped off. You also see that errors started occurring in the login service just after that, at 10:26 AM. The message for those errors is the same one you saw earlier: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic This suggests that the memory leaks cause the application to fail for a time. To understand the error a bit more, select the error class from the table at the bottom of the view: The stack trace shows that the service raised an UnhandledException from a function called EnsureAppIsStarted: With the information you've collected so far, you can conclude that Telco-Login Service's Java code has a memory leak. Also, the login service restarts the application when it runs out of memory, and it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests while the app is restarting. You also know the login service is effecting the web portal, because that is what introduced you to this problem, but does the issue effect any other services? Step 8 of 8 Visualize service dependencies using service maps. First, navigate back to APM, and from Telco-Login Service, select Monitor > Service map: Both Telco-Web Portal and Telco-Warehouse Portal depend on Telco-Login Service. So, when the login service goes down, you start seeing errors in both portals. Extra Credit Use the same steps you used to investigate issues in the web portal to confirm there are issues in the warehouse portal. Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal raise alerts during critical violations The login service's Java processes leak memory When the login service's host, Telco-Authentication-host, runs out of memory, it restarts the login application While the login application is restarting, it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests When the web portal and the warehouse portal make requests to the login service while it's restarting, they receive errors and raise errors of their own Now, as a Telco Lite developer, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the memory leak. Congratulations! Learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

      "body": "With the data explorer you can navigate all your data visually, without any NRQL knowledge. Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Tip To use the data explorer and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces query interfaces to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From data explorer you can access query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Access the query builder to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in the New Relic One Catalog, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Install and configure the New Relic One CLI, before starting this one. A Nerdpack is a package that contains all the files that make up a New Relic One application or visualization. Nerdpacks include files for metadata, Nerdlets, assets, and more. To create a Nerdpack, use the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack When nr1 prompts for a component name, use \"ab-test\" and watch the tool create the foundations of your Nerdpack. Once it's finished, explore the files it created for you. Root directory At the root level, you have a directory called ab-test. Everything inside this directory is part of the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls ab-test README.md nerdlets nr1.json package.json launchers node_modules package-lock.json Readme.md provides instructions for creating Nerdpack elements and serving your application locally. This and nr1 --help are useful if you forget how to interact with your Nerdpack using the command line tool. Javascript files package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules are important for running your JavaScript application, but aren't unique to Nerdpacks. You can learn about these modules from JavaScript courses should you need to tweak them. For now, take a look at nr1.json, one of the most relevant files in this directory. Metadata file nr1.json is the Nerdpack's metadata file, containing a schema type, unique identifier, a display name, and a description. Since you’re building a New Relic One application for running and analyzing A/B tests, update the package's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and set the description to \"A/B test your application using New Relic One\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"311bcd0c-f7eb-4285-afed-4219179bf91d\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"A/B test your application using New Relic One.\" } nr1.json Copy It's good to describe your application's purpose, especially if you're going to publish your application for others to use. Next, look at the launchers and nerdlets subdirectories. Launchers launchers is a directory because you can create multiple launchers for your New Relic One application. nr1 create only created one launcher for your Nerdpack and called it \"ab-test-launcher\". Inside its directory, there are two files: icon.png is an image that represents the application nr1.json is the launcher's metadata file Use \"A/B Test Launcher\" for the launcher's displayName and \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\" for the description in nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"ab-test-launcher\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test Launcher\", \"description\": \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\" } launchers/ab-test-launcher/nr1.json Copy Notice that the launcher has a rootNerdletId. This identifies the Nerdlet that the launcher opens when it's selected. This Nerdpack has only one Nerdlet, called ab-test-nerdlet, but some Nerdpacks may have multiple. Make sure that you set the rootNerdletId to the Nerdlet you want the launcher to open. Nerdlets The nerdlets directory contains all the Nerdlets that make up your New Relic One application. Since ab-test-nerdlet is the only Nerdlet in this Nerdpack, there is only one subdirectory. In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, there are three files: index.js is the JavaScript file that contains your Nerdlet component styles.scss holds the Sass stylesheet for your Nerdlet nr1.json contains the Nerdlet's metadata Update your Nerdlet's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and description to \"Control and view results of your A/B test\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"Control and view results of your A/B test\" } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Now, you've customized your Nerdpack, Nerdlet, and launcher with informative display names and descriptions, but what does your application actually do? Check out index.js to see what your default Nerdlet looks like: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, ab-test-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you have AbTestNerdletNerdlet, which nr1 created for you. It's a React component that renders a first-level welcome heading. Because this is the root Nerdlet, as specified in your launcher's nr1.json file, when you click on your launcher in the New Relic platform, the launcher will open a view that displays this heading. Tip In this lesson, you used nr1 create to create a Nerdpack, complete with a launcher and a Nerdlet. If you want to create another Nerdlet or Launcher in your Nerdpack, you can also do that with nr1 create: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdlet $ nr1 create --type launcher You can even skip the --type flag and select an option from a list: bash Copy $ nr1 create ? What kind of component do you want to create? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit. nerdpack ❯ nerdlet - create a/an Nerdlet artifact inside your Nerdpack. launcher catalog visualization In the next lesson, you'll learn how to serve your Nerdpack locally and see your app in action!

      "body": "If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin Before you begin, we recommend first reading about permissions. To start building, you must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

Observe your platform New Relic One gives you full access to the data from all the entities in your stack. Go to the New Relic Explorer at one.newrelic.com to see a full list of entities, identify overall behaviors, filter them to locate sources of performance issues, or plan improvements for your system. Search accounts and entities Access Quick find clicking the button at the top right corner of the New Relic One UI. Some details about your search: You can search across all your New Relic accounts with cross-account access. Entities that cease to exist are available in search for eight days. If your organization has multiple accounts, use the account picker at the top left corner to select accounts. Use chart and query features You can add most charts to a new or existing dashboard. Here are some query and chart features available across all or most of the platform: If you want to... Do this... Start querying your data Mouse over Browse data and select metrics, events, logs, or traces for a direct access to any of those types of data. Also, at the top of any UI page, select Query your data to access the data explorer and query builder. View a chart's query For some charts, you can view the NRQL query used to generate that chart. This can help you understand a chart better or use it as the basis for a new query. Choose time range Drag across a section of a chart to zoom in on that time range. Or, use the time picker in the top right corner of the UI to select pre-set time ranges or set a custom one. View chart details Mouse over a chart to see a pop-up with more detail. For some charts, selecting a point on the chart will take you to a UI page with more information about that metric. Hide or return chart elements To hide or unhide a displayed chart element, select that element's name below the chart. The chart display will adjust to reflect the absence or presence of that element. Share with teammates Here are some options for sharing New Relic UI pages and visualizations. If you want to... Do this... Share UI pages and dashboards To share an entire New Relic UI page, click Share near the top of the UI to copy the URL. Share charts If New Relic charts are built with NRQL queries, they have a menu that exposes various options, including sharing options like Get as image and Get chart link. Some notes about sharing: The person you share with may not have access to view the data from that account. To solve that, someone on your team with New Relic user management abilities must add that person to the account. If someone can't access a custom dashboard, it may be that it is set to private. Read more about dashboard permissions. Some sharing options have associated time ranges, which may impact later viewings of it. For example, if you use a chart's Get chart link option and that chart is set to 'Last 30 minutes', when viewed it will show the last 30 minutes, not the time range displayed when it was shared. To share a specific time range, you must select that time range in the UI. Smooth navigation: Customize your bar and access the shortcuts Select the edit icon at the right end of the navigation bar to customize your view. Home, Explorer, Browse data, Dashboards, and Alerts & AI are fixed, but you can favorite up to six more elements to display on the bar as well. The rest will go on the More group. Navigation shortcuts are a faster way to find entities and apps that are relevant to you. Mouse over any menu item for quick access to your favorite entities, those you recently visited, or just to search without having to navigate to a specific section. If you click on an entity, you can choose to open it in the same browser tab or in a new one. Adjust account and user settings To adjust account settings and user preferences, and to get support and docs links, use the account dropdown, located at the top right of the UI, beside your user name.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we're upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Features You can scroll down to the transition details, but first here are some features we've added that show how New Relic One dashboards are a clear improvement over Insights dashboards. Improved query abilities With New Relic One, you get: Ability to query many accounts from the same widget: New Relic One lets you query across all your associated accounts in one place. Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. This includes a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL query. Improved visualizations Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. Facet linking: You can filter your dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. There's also support for cases. Learn more. More charts or widgets in an area: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience. Join us and make the switch to New Relic One! Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps The Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs In July of 2021, the Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated and replaced with NerdGraph functionality. For more on this change, and tips on how to migrate, see NerdGraph API for dashboards. Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you.",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced query builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating browser, mobile, and synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's query builder or the GraphQL API. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use query builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How to modify existing entity types or create new ones How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic which matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. Tip For more information on how to modify existing entity types or create new ones please refer to our Entity Synthesis documentation. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you are aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "APM reports metric data in the form of metric timeslice data, and you can use NRQL to query, facet, and alert on this type of data. To explore timeslice data in the data explorer, see Explore your metrics. Why query metric timeslice data? We report metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data we call metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile, and browser (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Historically, this type of data couldn't be queried via our query language, NRQL. But now we are converting popular APM metrics from metric timeslice data to more-detailed dimensional metric data, which opens them up for querying via NRQL and via our NerdGraph API. This capability allows you to create powerful, in-depth custom visualizations of these important APM metrics. And this includes being able to query your custom metrics. Important You cannot query timeslice metrics in conjunction with dimensional metrics or event data. Any query involving newrelic.timeslice.value or an apm.* metric can only return APM metrics. Where to query? We recommend querying APM metric timeslice data using New Relic One query builder in advanced mode. This experience offers full NRQL functionality, and also gives helpful auto-complete suggestions and feedback on query errors. You can also: Make NRQL queries using our NerdGraph (GraphQL) API Alert on NRQL queries using NRQL alert conditions How to construct a query In APM, some charts have the option to view the NRQL query that generated that chart. This can be a good option for understanding how to query metrics. The NRQL query examined below is slightly modified from the error rate chart on the APM summary page. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE (entity.guid = 'AN_ENTITY_GUID') AND (transactionType = 'Web') SINCE 1 day ago TIMESERIES Copy Here is a breakdown of how the parts of this query work: Query segment What does it do? FROM Metric Metric is one of our core data types, and metric timeslice data is stored as this data type. For general tips on querying Metric data, see Metric query examples. SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) This math generates a count of errors out of a total count of transaction metrics. This query uses the converted metric names. Note that you can use other aggregator functions. WHERE (entity.guid = 'AN_ENTITY_GUID') You must specify at least one data source. You can select a single entity's GUID, as shown here, or you can select multiple sources. This query uses entity.guid, but you can also use appId or appName. AND (transactionType = 'Web') Sets the transaction type to web, meaning that background/non-web transactions won't be counted. SINCE 1 day ago Selecting a time range. TIMESERIES This optional clause displays the results in a time-based chart. For general information on NRQL syntax, including FROM, FACET, and TIMESERIES, see Intro to NRQL. For more queries, see Query examples. How metric timeslice data is converted The conversion of original APM metric timeslice metrics into dimensional metrics that are available for querying is an ongoing process and isn't complete. If you don't see a metric you're looking for in this section, see Generic queries. Here are how the original APM metric timeslice metrics are converted into dimensional metrics: Metric timeslice structure Dimensional metric structure APM metric names are represented as single strings of segments separated by forward slashes. For example, the “Datastore/statement/MySQL/users/select” metric represents the time spent in a select database operation on the users table. A single dimensional metric named apm.service.datastore.operation.duration represents the entire group of datastore metrics. This metric has three attributes representing the data values encoded into the metric name, datastoreType, table and operation: datastoreType = ‘MySQL’ table = ‘users’ operation = ‘select’ Some of the APM metrics made available as dimensional metrics: Metric name Description Attributes apm.service.cpu.usertime.utilization Time spent in user-mode code percentage apm.service.datastore.operation.duration Response time for database calls broken out by table operations datastoreType, table, operation apm.service.error.count Summary error count metrics transactionType apm.service.external.host.duration Response time for external calls broken out by external host name external.host apm.service.instance.count Count of the number of agent instances apm.service.memory.physical Process memory in MB apm.service.transaction.apdex Apdex scores per transaction transactionName, transactionType apm.service.transaction.duration Response time per transaction keyTransactionName, transactionName, transactionType apm.service.transaction.error.count Error counts per transaction keyTransactionName, transactionName, transactionType apm.service.transaction.external.duration External call response time by transaction type transactionType Learn how to see all metrics available to you. To understand more about the general structure of metric timeslice data, including some common examples, see Metric timeslice data. Attributes These attributes are available in addition to the metric-specific attributes listed in the APM metrics table above. Name Description appName The name of the application. appId The ID of the application. entity.guid The GUID of the application. host The host of the monitored process. host.bootId The ID of the boot of the host, if available. host.displayName The display_name of the host, if it was set in the agent. instanceName For Java APM agents, host : port metricName The name of the dimensional metric. metricTimesliceName The timeslice name of the legacy metric. scope (Optional) The timeslice name of the legacy metric that this metric is \"scoped\" to. Metrics with a scope belong to it--their measurements apply to the context of the metric named in the scope attribute. See below for examples. Generic queries with the newrelic.timeslice.value metric For metrics that haven't been converted to dimensional metrics, or for your own custom metrics, we have a dimensional metric named newrelic.timeslice.value. Important We recommend using the dimensional metrics from the table above when possible. When to use newrelic.timeslice.value? Given a metric timeslice name, you can query to see if it has a converted dimensional metric equivalent with this syntax: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE metricTimesliceName = 'Datastore/statement/MySQL/test/select' Copy If the only metric name returned is newrelic.timeslice.value, you'll need to query your data using this general approach. Get available metrics To get a list of available metrics for an application, you can use a query like: SELECT uniques(metricTimesliceName) FROM Metric WHERE appName='YOUR_APP_NAME' AND newrelic.timeslice.value IS NOT NULL Copy Facet on a wildcarded metric name segment Some metric timeslice names include attribute values as segments of the metric name. For example, our APM agents report metrics by tracking the duration of external calls using this format: External/{externalHost}/all Copy Here, {externalHost} represents the host name for the outbound network call. Here's an example of a generic newrelic.timeslice.value query of a custom metric that facets on a wildcarded metric segment: FROM Metric SELECT count(newrelic.timeslice.value) WHERE appName = 'MY APP' WITH METRIC_FORMAT 'Custom/Labels/{action}' TIMESERIES FACET action Copy In this query, {action} creates a temporary attribute, action, which is then used by FACET action. You can use any name you want, because it's only an attribute that exists for the duration of the query. You should choose a name that does not conflict with an existing attribute name. Recommended aggregator functions Recommended NRQL aggregator functions include: apdex average sum count rate uniques Query examples Some examples of querying metric timeslice data: Facet by multiple app names This query uses WHERE… IN to specify two applications and then facet by them: FROM Metric SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'Web throughput' WHERE appName IN ('MY_APPLICATION', 'MY_OTHER_APPLICATION') AND (transactionType = 'Web') FACET appName TIMESERIES Copy Throughput-per-minute rate This query displays requests-per-minute chart using the rate function: FROM Metric SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'HttpDispatcher requests_per_minute' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND (transactionType = 'Web') TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago Copy Facet by host-related attributes This query displays a requests-per-minute chart faceted by host name: FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.transaction.duration) as 'HttpDispatcher requests_per_minute' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND (transactionType = 'Web') TIMESERIES SINCE 3 hours ago FACET host LIMIT 20 Copy Instead of using host, you can facet by other host-related attributes, like host.bootId. Query of average duration of a metric This queries the average duration for a metric using average: FROM Metric SELECT average(apm.service.transaction.duration) as 'HttpDispatcher average duration' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND (transactionType = 'Web') TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago Copy Break down average time spent in a transaction by its component segments This query breaks down the average duration of single transaction (in this case, the show action in the UsersController of a Rails app named MY_APPLICATION) by the top 20 individual segments (database queries, external service calls, garbage collection time, etc.). It reproduces much of the \"Application breakdown\" chart as seen on the Transactions page In New Relic One for a service entity: FROM Metric SELECT average(newrelic.timeslice.value, exclusiveTime: true) as 'duration, seconds' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND scope = 'Controller/users/show' LIMIT 20 FACET metricTimesliceName TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago Copy",

Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds, and install any of our agents or integrations. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. While we provide you with an out of the box experience to see your data with curated dashboards, you can tailor the access to your data and custom the visibility in several ways, including in the UI or via API. Important To better understand your data stored in New Relic, see Data types. Our open door to your data Regardless of your experience with New Relic, we’ll help you discover, understand and visualize your data. You... Then do this... Just installed an agent and want to see your data in New Relic. Browse your data easily without building queries. With the data explorer, you can understand the data we’ve stored, see its cardinality, or build charts in a few clicks. Know what data is available, but you want to understand more about what else is coming with that data. If you’re an advanced user, use our query builder to tailor the data you want to retrieve. Have a specific question and you want to deep dive on the data to get the answer. Refine your NRQL query to dig down to the bottom of your issues. Want to build a dashboard. Create a custom dashboard easily from the data explorer or the query builder. Browse your data in the UI New Relic One offers several experiences that don't require knowledge of NRQL or any query language. On the UI, go to the Query your data button, or click the Browse data dropdown, then select the data type (metrics, events, logs, and traces) you want to explore. For events and metrics, use the data explorer, an intuitive data navigator to create visualizations. From the explorer you can switch to the query builder to see and refine your query. Distributed tracing query: a specialized UI for querying traces. Logs query: a specialized UI for querying New Relic Logs data. Query data in the UI If you're ready to do more than browsing data, become an all-hands actor and personalize your queries in the New Relic UI. Use query languages, including our New Relic query language or our PromQL-style query language, to edit queries with full flexibility. For example, you can add more WHERE clauses, modify the returned value, change to other types of visualizations, etc. Tip Are you new to querying languages? Start browsing data in the data explorer, then turn to the query builder to see the query you built, and refine it. There are two ways to write your own queries to retrieve data and build charts: Query builder in NRQL mode: Query using New Relic query language (NRQL), the same language we use to build most of our UI experiences, and the most advanced way of querying data in New Relic. Query builder in PromQL-style mode: Write basic queries using a PromQL-style query. Query data via API When getting into the New Relic platform is not an option, you can use APIs to retrieve and query your data in New Relic. For example, you can run NRQL (our query language) queries with NerdGraph (our GraphQL API). For more information, see the introduction to New Relic APIs.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "New Relic One has some basic UI functions that are widely available across the platform. Understanding these features will help you find and analyze your data more easily. Observe your platform New Relic One gives you full access to the data from all the entities in your stack. Go to the New Relic Explorer at one.newrelic.com to see a full list of entities, identify overall behaviors, filter them to locate sources of performance issues, or plan improvements for your system. Search accounts and entities Access Quick find clicking the button at the top right corner of the New Relic One UI. Some details about your search: You can search across all your New Relic accounts with cross-account access. Entities that cease to exist are available in search for eight days. If your organization has multiple accounts, use the account picker at the top left corner to select accounts. Use chart and query features You can add most charts to a new or existing dashboard. Here are some query and chart features available across all or most of the platform: If you want to... Do this... Start querying your data Mouse over Browse data and select metrics, events, logs, or traces for a direct access to any of those types of data. Also, at the top of any UI page, select Query your data to access the data explorer and query builder. View a chart's query For some charts, you can view the NRQL query used to generate that chart. This can help you understand a chart better or use it as the basis for a new query. Choose time range Drag across a section of a chart to zoom in on that time range. Or, use the time picker in the top right corner of the UI to select pre-set time ranges or set a custom one. View chart details Mouse over a chart to see a pop-up with more detail. For some charts, selecting a point on the chart will take you to a UI page with more information about that metric. Hide or return chart elements To hide or unhide a displayed chart element, select that element's name below the chart. The chart display will adjust to reflect the absence or presence of that element. Share with teammates Here are some options for sharing New Relic UI pages and visualizations. If you want to... Do this... Share UI pages and dashboards To share an entire New Relic UI page, click Share near the top of the UI to copy the URL. Share charts If New Relic charts are built with NRQL queries, they have a menu that exposes various options, including sharing options like Get as image and Get chart link. Some notes about sharing: The person you share with may not have access to view the data from that account. To solve that, someone on your team with New Relic user management abilities must add that person to the account. If someone can't access a custom dashboard, it may be that it is set to private. Read more about dashboard permissions. Some sharing options have associated time ranges, which may impact later viewings of it. For example, if you use a chart's Get chart link option and that chart is set to 'Last 30 minutes', when viewed it will show the last 30 minutes, not the time range displayed when it was shared. To share a specific time range, you must select that time range in the UI. Smooth navigation: Customize your bar and access the shortcuts Select the edit icon at the right end of the navigation bar to customize your view. Home, Explorer, Browse data, Dashboards, and Alerts & AI are fixed, but you can favorite up to six more elements to display on the bar as well. The rest will go on the More group. Navigation shortcuts are a faster way to find entities and apps that are relevant to you. Mouse over any menu item for quick access to your favorite entities, those you recently visited, or just to search without having to navigate to a specific section. If you click on an entity, you can choose to open it in the same browser tab or in a new one. Adjust account and user settings To adjust account settings and user preferences, and to get support and docs links, use the account dropdown, located at the top right of the UI, beside your user name.",

With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Features You can scroll down to the transition details, but first here are some features we've added that show how New Relic One dashboards are a clear improvement over Insights dashboards. Improved query abilities With New Relic One, you get: Ability to query many accounts from the same widget: New Relic One lets you query across all your associated accounts in one place. Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. This includes a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL query. Improved visualizations Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. Facet linking: You can filter your dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. There's also support for cases. Learn more. More charts or widgets in an area: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience. Join us and make the switch to New Relic One! Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps The Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs In July of 2021, the Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated and replaced with NerdGraph functionality. For more on this change, and tips on how to migrate, see NerdGraph API for dashboards. Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you.",

      "body": "If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin Before you begin, we recommend first reading about permissions. To start building, you must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

      "body": "Tag your Nerdpack versions to track and subscribe to them. Untag versions to prevent subscriptions or hide Nerdpacks from the catalog. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions To tag a Nerdpack version, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can tag them. Tag a version After you've published a Nerdpack version to the New Relic One catalog, you can tag it with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 2 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. Here, you tagged version 1.0.0 as DEV. Now, you, and other users on your account, can use this tag: You see the tag as an option to subscribe to when you add the Nerdpack to your account If you subscribe to the DEV tag and it gets updated later—say, DEV is applied to version 1.0.1—you automatically get upgraded to the new version without having to subscribe again. Important One of the features of tagging release versions is that users who are subscribed to a tag automatically get updates when that tag is used for another version. This means that if a user is testing one version, say 1.0.0, and you apply that same tag to another version, say 1.0.1, that user will see version 1.0.1 in their account, and they can no longer access the Nerdpack they were testing before. Often times, this is the expected behavior, but make sure you consider this side effect when you use tags. Step 2 of 2 View your Nerdpack's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 5 hours ago DEV This output confirms your DEV tag on version 1.0.0. Untag a version As you build more versions of your Nerdpack, you may update your tags to newer versions. However, you can also remove a tag from your Nerdpack with nr1. Step 1 of 3 From your Nerdpack's root directory, view your registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ---- 2.0.0 a few seconds ago DEV 1.0.1 8 minutes ago BETA, STABLE 1.0.0 6 hours ago Here, you see that version 1.0.0 has no tags, version 1.0.1 has two tags, BETA and STABLE, and version 2.0.0 has one tag, DEV. Step 2 of 3 Remove the BETA tag from your Nerdpack versions: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:untag --tag=BETA ✔ Removed nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 tag BETA. Step 3 of 3 Verify that the tag was removed from your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- -------------- ---- 2.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV 1.0.1 13 minutes ago STABLE 1.0.0 6 hours ago Resolve issues with tagging a Nerdpack version Sometimes, when you tag to a Nerdpack version, you may come across issues. Whether you can't tag your Nerdpack or you can't untag your Nerdpack, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Publish your Nerdpack If you try to tag your Nerdpack without first publishing it, you'll get an error: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV › Error: A downstream error occurred. This error message doesn't say much, but you can use the --verbose option to see more information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV --verbose init version: @oclif/command@1.8.0 argv: [ '--tag=DEV', '--verbose', [length]: 2 ] dist/metadata.json does not exist. package.json will be used instead. Using profile account-1234567 Request: POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Data: mutation nerdpackTagVersion( nerdpackId: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", versionTag: tag: \"DEV\", version: \"1.0.0\" } ) nerdpackId tags version } } Headers: 'API-Key': '<YOU USER KEY>', 'Content-Type': 'application/graphql' } This more verbose error message shows the GraphQL that runs behind the scenes for nr1 nerdpack:tag. The important part of the message here is: bash Copy dist/metadata.json does not exist. package.json will be used instead. The dist directory is created when you publish your app. So, because it hasn't been published yet, this directory doesn't exist and nr1 falls back to package.json to look for details about your Nerdpack. But, because the UUID in your package.json isn't in the New Relic registry, the command failed. So, before you tag your versions, publish them to the registry: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV Tip Remember that you can also tag a version at the same time you deploy it! bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag=DEV Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack You can only remove tags that have no subscribers. If you try to remove a tag that users are subscribed to, you'll get an error: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 2.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 3 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 2.0.0 an hour ago DEV 1.0.1 an hour ago 1.0.0 6 hours ago $ nr1 nerdpack:untag -t DEV › Error: A downstream error occurred.

Unsubscribe, then try to remove the DEV tag again: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. $ nr1 nerdpack:untag --tag=DEV ✔ Removed nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 tag DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 2.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 3 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 2.0.0 an hour ago 1.0.1 an hour ago 1.0.0 6 hours ago",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add tables, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you added a variety of charts to your A/B test application. These charts presented different facets of information about your A/B test, and they behaved independently from one other. In this lesson, you’ll create a new pair of line charts and learn how to synchronize their behaviors. Before you write any new code, consult your design guide to understand the role that these new charts will play in your application: In the design guide, there is a line graph under each of the tables you created in the last lesson. These line graphs show the version-specific response times for newsletter signup requests. Now, you’ll build two more line charts, but this time, you’ll group them with a ChartGroup and specify that their values are measured in milliseconds. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-a-chart-group/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named page-views.js: bash Copy $ touch page-views.js Step 3 of 9 In this new file, create a component called VersionPageViews to hold a LineChart, which shows the number of times a page is viewed: import React from 'react'; import { LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Notice the new attribute in the series' metadata fields: units_data. This attribute describes the unit type for a specified data axis. In this case, you set the unit type for the y axis to 'MS', which stands for milliseconds. Other options for unit types, include: 'PERCENTAGE', 'TIMESTAMP', and 'BYTES_PER_SECOND'. Step 4 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In index.js, import ChartGroup from nr1 and group your VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <ChartGroup> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </ChartGroup> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Because the tables are conceptually related, as they show contrasting performance metrics over the same timeslice, it makes sense to group them in a ChartGroup. This means that the two charts behave synchronously. For example, when you hover over one chart, the other chart shows a hover indicator at the same x coordinate. Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the LineChart components synchronized in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Tip Each of the chart component types you've used in this lesson have had different series configurations. Most chart components share the same metadata attributes, like LineChart and PieChart, but differ in their data formats. It's helpful to be aware of the different data formats, for when you create your own charts. You can read more about the data formats in the chart component documentation. Now your application is filled with charts, but it doesn't look great. The charts are stacked on top of one another in an unhelpful way. In the next lesson, you'll learn about the user interface components from the SDK and how you can use them to organize your charts. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. When you're ready, continue on to the next lesson: Add user interface components to your application.",

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you easily get StatsD-format data into New Relic. You can also add any arbitrary tags (key-value pairs) to your data. Once your metrics are in New Relic, you can query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Requirements This integration uses our Metric API and our Event API to ingest data. To use these APIs, you'll need an Insert API key. The integration adheres to the Metric API requirements and data limits. The default rate limit is 100,000 data points per minute (DPM). If you think you're missing metrics or sending more than 100K DPM, see Request data changes. To see if your account is hitting the rate limit, run the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' FACET category, message LIMIT 100 since 1 day ago Copy Install This section will explain how to do a standard install. If you want to run StatsD in Kubernetes, see Kubernetes install. To install the StatsD integration, run the following command and include your New Relic account ID and New Relic Insert API key. This generates a TOML configuration file used by gostatsd. docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy If your account is in the EU data center region, add this to the above command: -e NR_EU_REGION=true \\ Copy After installing, you can: Do optional additional configuration Define your metrics Add custom tags to your data Create alerts Install for Kubernetes Here are examples of Kubernetes manifests for deployment and service objects: Kubernetes manifest examples Below are examples of Kubernetes manifests to deploy StatsD in a Kubernetes environment and create a StatsD service named newrelic-statsd. You need to insert your account ID and your license key. deployment.yml: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: selector: matchLabels: app: newrelic-statsd replicas: 2 revisionHistoryLimit: 2 template: metadata: labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: containers: - name: newrelic-statsd image: newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 env: - name: NR_ACCOUNT_ID value: \"NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID\" - name: NR_API_KEY value: \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy service.yml: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: newrelic-statsd port: 80 targetPort: 8125 protocol: UDP selector: app: newrelic-statsd Copy For configuration details, see Kubernetes configuration. Configure In the install procedure, you run nri-statsd with environment variables, and this generates a TOML configuration file. Additionally, you can set these configuration options: Configuration options Description expiry-interval string If a metric is not updated for this amount of time, we stop reporting that metric. Default is 5m. If you want to send the metrics only if the value was updated between the flush intervals, configure this to 1ms. To never expire metrics, set it to 0. percent-threshold list of integers Specifies the percentiles used for metrics aggregation. Default: 90. metrics-addr string Indicates address on which to listen for metrics. Default: :8125. Tip To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the StatsD integration you must define the following endpoints in the custom configuration: address = 'https://gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/ $NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' Copy address-metrics = 'https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' Copy Here are some examples of customizing configuration by overwriting the default configuration: Example of custom configuration # Specify after how long do we expire metrics, default:5m expiry-interval = '1ms' # percent-threshold specify a list of percentiles for metrics aggregation, default:90 percent-threshold = [90, 99] backends='newrelic' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy Disable timer sub-metrics: By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. If you want to disable those metrics you can do it by adding a disabled-sub-metrics configuration section and set true for the ones you want disabled. Here's an example: # disabled-sub-metrics configuration section allows disabling timer sub-metrics [disabled-sub-metrics] # Regular metrics count=false count-per-second=false mean=false median=false lower=false upper=false stddev=false sum=false sum-squares=false # Percentile metrics count-pct=false mean-pct=false sum-pct=false sum-squares-pct=false lower-pct=false upper-pct=false Copy Docker: overwrite default configuration To overwrite the default nri-statsd configuration while running in a container, you can mount a configuration file inside the container. You can adopt the following template as needed for your situation. Example: backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To run the container with the file mounted in the appropriate path: docker run \\ ... -v ${PWD}/nri-statsd.toml:/etc/opt/newrelic/nri-statsd.toml \\ ... newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Kubernetes: overwrite default configuration The best approach to configure nri-statsd running in Kubernetes is to use a configMap and mount the configMap into the container. (This is a similar process to mounting the configuration file in Docker.) Example: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-statsd-config namespace: default data: nri-statsd.toml: | backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = '$NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To use the configMap, declare a volume on your deployment spec template and then declare a volumeMount on your container spec. Example: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment spec: template: spec: containers: .... volumeMounts: - mountPath: /etc/opt/newrelic/ name: nri-statsd-config volumes: - name: nri-statsd-config configMap: name: nri-statsd-config Copy Metric format The integration receives metrics using the StatsD protocol. Optionally, the sample rate can be configured and tags can be added. Here's the metric data format we use: <metric name>:<value>|<type>|@<sample rate>|#<tags> Copy Here are explanations of these fields: Field name Description < metric name> string Required. Name of the metric. < value> string Required. The metric type: c = counter g = gauge ms = timer @ < sample rate> float Optional for simple counters or timer counters. When many metrics must be sent, you can use sampling to reduce network traffic. The downside is a reduction in the resolution of the data. An example of how this would work for sample rates below 1: If you set this to 0.1, the counter would send a measurement one out of every 10 times. # < tags> string Optional. Tags attached to your metrics are converted into attributes (key-value pairs). For more on tagging options, see Tags. Metric types Here are the types of metrics and how to format them: Counter A counter measures the number of occurrences of an event. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. A counter can be incremented or decremented during the same flush interval by adding a sign to the value. In the following example, the counter value will be 2: counter:4|c counter:-2|c Copy At each flush, the current count is sent and reset to 0. If the count is not updated, at the next flush it will send the value 0. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Here’s an example of a counter that is being sampled 1 out of 10 times: counter:4|c@0.1 Copy Gauge A gauge represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include temperature, CPU usage, and memory. Here's an example: temperature:40|g Copy If the gauge is not updated, at the next flush it will send the previous value. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Timer The timer metric type measures timing data. By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. These are sent as sub-metrics in the following format: <metric_base_name>.std_dev <metric_base_name>.median <metric_base_name>.summary <metric_base_name>.sum_squares <metric_base_name>.mean <metric_base_name>.per_second Copy The configured percentiles will generate the following metrics. The percentile threshold value will be attached as a tag. <metric_base_name>.sum_squares.percentiles <metric_base_name>.sum.percentiles <metric_base_name>.count.percentiles <metric_base_name>.upper.percentiles <metric_base_name>.mean.percentiles Copy The percentile threshold can be tweaked with the percent-threshold config option. These can be controlled through the disabled-sub-metrics configuration section. Add tags (attributes) You can add tags to your data, which we save as attributes (key-value pairs). There are two options for adding tags: Add default tags that apply to all metrics: These apply to all metrics. They are fixed and don't change over time. Add metric-level tags: These apply to specific metrics and allow the value to be changed between two submits. Add default tags that apply to all metrics Add tags to metrics and events by defining an environment variable in the startup command. Here's an example that would create two tags: -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" Copy Here's that environment variable used in the startup command: docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Add metric-level tags When defining the metric format, you can add tags using this format: <bucket name>:<value>|<type>|#<tags> Copy In this example, <tags> is a comma-separated list of tags. Tags format is: simple or key:value. Here's an example NRQL query that includes a custom tag: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE environment = 'production' Copy Create alerts You can alert on StatsD data using NRQL alert conditions. Alert example This procedure walks you through sending some sample data and then creating an alert condition using that data. First, send this data to New Relic’s StatsD container: echo \"prod.test.num:32|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Next, create a NRQL alert condition using this query: SELECT latest(prod.test.num) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'prod.test.num' Copy Here's an image showing creating this NRQL alert condition. Notice that the sample data sent in is represented by the blue dot on the upper right of the chart. Now we can create the alert condition with these settings: When you create the NRQL alert condition, be sure to set the Condition name. If a metric with a value above 50 is sent, then an incident is created and notified. The incident is closed automatically after 24 hours. To test that the alert is working, run this command: echo \"prod.test.num:60|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Find and use data To query your data, you'd use any New Relic query option. For example, you might run a NRQL query like: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'myMetric' and environment = 'production' Copy For more on how to query the Metric data type, see Query metric data. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version If you already had the CLI, update it: bash Copy $ nr1 update Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start. You’re ready to build an application with the New Relic One CLI! Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the New Relic One catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published to the catalog, you can view it by visiting the Apps page of New Relic: From the catalog UI, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top right of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app in the catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

      "body": "Subscribe to a Nerdpack to use it in the New Relic platform. Unsubscribe from Nerdpacks you no longer use. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions To subscribe to a Nerdpack, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can subscribe to them: Publish your Nerdpack Tag your Nerdpack if it's published and doesn't yet have a tag Subscribe to a Nerdpack Subscribe to a published Nerdpack, with either the web UI or the nr1 CLI, to use it in your account. Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack under New Relic One catalog: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the New Relic One catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel. Tip nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:unset. Read the nr1 subscription:unset documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:unset --help Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you subscribe to a Nerdpack, you may run into issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

      "info": "Intro to New Relic One SDK",
      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: allows you to configure your Nerdlet and write to your Nerdlet's URL state.",

      "body": "In your application, you can display data in charts, like those used elsewhere in New Relic's user interface. The New Relic One SDK provides React components for different chart types. Once you decide the kind of data you want to present, either from New Relic or some other source, you supply that data to your chart, using props. Query New Relic data In some cases, you want to fetch data from New Relic's database. For example, you may want to display a line chart which plots the number of transactions your application receives over time. With your chart component, set the accountId and query props to query your New Relic data using NRQL: <LineChart accountId={1234} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" />; Copy Alternatively, you can fetch data with a NrqlQuery and set the data prop: <NrqlQuery accountId={1234} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\"> {({ data }) => <LineChart data={data} />} </NrqlQuery>; Copy If you're looking to visualize New Relic data, such as your web application's response times or your server's throughput, querying data in your charts is the way to go. But what if you want to create charts that aren't focused on New Relic data? The data prop is flexible enough that you can supply any arbitrary data, as long as it matches the standardized format. Craft custom data Whether you use custom data sets or the results of a NrqlQuery, a chart's data prop must be an array of objects where each object has both of the following fields: metadata: Defines how the chart presents its data data: An array of data points that appear on the chart For example, create a chart consisting of a line between two points by supplying two x-y coordinates in its data field: const data = [ { metadata: { id: 'series-1', name: 'My series', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0, }, { x: 20, y: 10, }, ], }, ]; <LineChart data={data} />; Copy This LineChart plots a line between coordinates (0, 0) and (20, 10). Use x-y coordinates for all two-dimensional chart formats. For other formats, which you'll learn more about later, use other types of data points. Because data accepts an array, you can supply two series to the same chart: const data = [ { metadata: { id: 'series-1', name: 'My series', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0, }, { x: 20, y: 10, }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'series-2', name: 'My second series', viz: 'main', color: 'red', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 50, }, { x: 20, y: 100, }, ], }, ]; <LineChart data={data} />; Copy In this example, you create a single chart with two series. The first series contains the line from the last example. The second series contains a line between points (0, 50) and (20, 100). When using two series in a single chart, like this, you may want to define how the chart represents each series. Use metadata to define those elements. Metadata A series's metadata defines certain features of the series, itself, such as how it should be displayed in your chart. metadata consists of the following attributes: Attribute Description id The series's identifier. Two series having the same id are considered the same series, regardless of where they are located. In general, use a unique id for each series. However, if you use the same series for multiple charts, keeping the id consistent can help with some cross-chart functionality, like simultaneously highlighting multiple charts. name The series's name. name is used in legends, tooltips, and other areas to indicate which series you’re looking at. color The series's color. Most visualizations use this value to differentiate series. Some visualizations, like BillboardChart or JsonChart, ignore it. Use any valid CSS color representation, such as #RRGGBB, hsl(HHH, SS%, LL%), or rgba(RR, GG, BB, .AA). Avoid tweaking the alpha value, when possible, because charts use alpha to highlight or dim certain series. viz The series's visual style. While you most often use main, this field accepts several options: main: Show the series based on chart's type. For instance, a LineChart shows the series as a line, and an AreaChart shows the series as an area. line: Show the series as a line, regardless of the chart's type. This setting applies only to AreaChart and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. area: Show the series as an area, regardless of the chart's type. This setting applies only to LineChart and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. event: Show the series as an event, regardless of the chart's type. Charts represent an event as a vertical area behind the main visualization. Events are often used to show alerts. This setting applies only to AreaChart, LineChart, and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. target-line: Show the series as a vertical line. This setting applies only to AreaChart, LineChart, and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. units_data You can assign a unit type to each axis on a chart. The chart will present data according to the unit type you set with units_data. To set unit_data, pass a JSON object with maps the axis to one of the following unit types: UNKNOWN: The chart displays the series with no special units. COUNT: Each value in the chart represents a count. The chart formats values with their International System prefix. For example, \"k\" represents thousands, \"M\" represents millions, and \"G\" represents billions. PERCENTAGE: Each value in the chart represents a percentage. Typically, you provide values ranging from 0 to 1. The chart formats a value of 1 as \"100%\", a value of 2 as \"200%\", and a value of 0.01 as \"1%\". MS: Each value in the chart represents some number of milliseconds. The chart represents values higher than 1 as a human-readable time duration. For example, 60000 is represented as \"1 minute\". The chart represents values lower than 1 using SI prefixes. For example, 0.001 is represented as 1 μs. TIMESTAMP: Each value in the chart represents a timestamp, the number milliseconds since midnight UTC on January 1, 1970, the UNIX Epoch. The chart formats each value as a date. BITS: Each value in the chart represents some number of bits. The chart formats these values using \"b\". When upscaling, the chart will display decimal prefixes instead of binary ones. For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kb\". BITS_PER_SECOND: Each value in the chart represents some number of bits per second. The chart formats these values using \"b/s\". When upscaling, the chart will display decimal prefixes instead of binary ones. For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kb/s\". BYTES: Each value in the chart represents some number of bytes. The chart formats these values using \"B\". For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kB\". BYTES_PER_SECOND: Each value in the chart represents some number of bytes per second. The chart formats these values using \"B/s\". For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kB/s\". So, to represent the y-axis for your series in bits, set the y-value in units_data: { \"units_data\": { \"y\": \"BITS\" } } Data While a data series can contain any arbitrary values, a chart only uses values which adhere to its type. So, create your data points according to the chart type: Series Type Example Description Unidimensional [{ \"y\": 10 }, { \"y\": 20 }] The chart plots data points using y values. Use this format with BarChart, BillboardChart, PieChart, StackedBarChart. Two-dimensional [ { \"x\": 10, \"y\": 20 }, { \"x\": 20, \"y\": 30 } ] The chart plots data points using x and y values. Use this format with AreaChart, LineChart, ScatterChart, SparklineChart, Funnel [{ \"label1\": 10, \"label2\": 20 }] The chart plots data according to labels. Use this format with FunnelChart. Table [{ \"jobType\": \"SIMPLE\", \"count\": 18 }] The chart plots data according to table columns. You must specify table columns in the metadata. Use this format with TableChart. Event [ { \"x0\": 0, \"x1\": 5 }, { \"x0\": 10, \"x1\": 15 } ] The chart plots the event's width based on x0 and x1 values. Histogram [ { \"x0\": 10, \"x1\": 20, \"y\": 100 }, { \"x0\": 30, \"x1\": 40, \"y\": 150 } ] The chart plots the series's width based on x0 and x1 and height based on y. Use this format with HistogramChart and HeatmapChart. Tip JsonChart is a special case because it processes any valid data. For example, you can set an arbitrary JSON object for the chart's data: const data = { data: [ { id: 1, name: 'Foo', price: 123, tags: ['Bar', 'Eek'], stock: { warehouse: 300, retail: 20, } } ], } <JsonChart data={data} /> Copy Special States In previous sections, you learned that a chart's data is an array of series. But you can use special values to present special chart states: null or undefined: Indicates the chart is “loading” its data. In this state, the chart shows a placeholder data set. []: Indicates there is no data to show. The chart states, \"No chart data available\". Configure your chart As you've seen, you use query or data to supply data to your chart, but you can configure other aspects of your chart, too, such as visual settings and click and hover event listeners. Read the documentation for the chart you're using for more specific information. Chart Groups Under some circumstances, you might want to synchronize events, such as dragging or scrubbing, across multiple charts. To do this, use a ChartGroup. All charts in a ChartGroup synchronize their events: <ChartGroup> <Stack> <StackItem> <LineChart accountId={1} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago\" /> </StackItem> <StackItem> <AreaChart accountId={1} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Synthetics SINCE 1 day ago\" /> </StackItem> </Stack> </ChartGroup>; Copy Ideally, group charts that are conceptually related, and separate charts that are conceptually unrelated. Next Step Read the documentation specific to the chart you'd like to use to learn specifics about that chart's behavior and configuration.",

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type. Use SegmentedControl and SegmentedControlItem to switch between the two chart types. Tip To learn more about the components available in the New Relic One SDK, go to our Intro to New Relic One SDK.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One app catalog. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github.

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] }, \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

Observe your platform New Relic One gives you full access to the data from all the entities in your stack. Go to the New Relic Explorer at one.newrelic.com to see a full list of entities, identify overall behaviors, filter them to locate sources of performance issues, or plan improvements for your system. Search accounts and entities Access Quick find clicking the button at the top right corner of the New Relic One UI. Some details about your search: You can search across all your New Relic accounts with cross-account access. Entities that cease to exist are available in search for eight days. If your organization has multiple accounts, use the account picker at the top left corner to select accounts. Use chart and query features You can add most charts to a new or existing dashboard. Here are some query and chart features available across all or most of the platform: If you want to... Do this... Start querying your data Mouse over Browse data and select metrics, events, logs, or traces for a direct access to any of those types of data. Also, at the top of any UI page, select Query your data to access the data explorer and query builder. View a chart's query For some charts, you can view the NRQL query used to generate that chart. This can help you understand a chart better or use it as the basis for a new query. Choose time range Drag across a section of a chart to zoom in on that time range. Or, use the time picker in the top right corner of the UI to select pre-set time ranges or set a custom one. View chart details Mouse over a chart to see a pop-up with more detail. For some charts, selecting a point on the chart will take you to a UI page with more information about that metric. Hide or return chart elements To hide or unhide a displayed chart element, select that element's name below the chart. The chart display will adjust to reflect the absence or presence of that element. Share with teammates Here are some options for sharing New Relic UI pages and visualizations. If you want to... Do this... Share UI pages and dashboards To share an entire New Relic UI page, click Share near the top of the UI to copy the URL. Share charts If New Relic charts are built with NRQL queries, they have a menu that exposes various options, including sharing options like Get as image and Get chart link. Some notes about sharing: The person you share with may not have access to view the data from that account. To solve that, someone on your team with New Relic user management abilities must add that person to the account. If someone can't access a custom dashboard, it may be that it is set to private. Read more about dashboard permissions. Some sharing options have associated time ranges, which may impact later viewings of it. For example, if you use a chart's Get chart link option and that chart is set to 'Last 30 minutes', when viewed it will show the last 30 minutes, not the time range displayed when it was shared. To share a specific time range, you must select that time range in the UI. Smooth navigation: Customize your bar and access the shortcuts Select the edit icon at the right end of the navigation bar to customize your view. Home, Explorer, Browse data, Dashboards, and Alerts & AI are fixed, but you can favorite up to six more elements to display on the bar as well. The rest will go on the More group. Navigation shortcuts are a faster way to find entities and apps that are relevant to you. Mouse over any menu item for quick access to your favorite entities, those you recently visited, or just to search without having to navigate to a specific section. If you click on an entity, you can choose to open it in the same browser tab or in a new one. Adjust account and user settings To adjust account settings and user preferences, and to get support and docs links, use the account dropdown, located at the top right of the UI, beside your user name.",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced query builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating browser, mobile, and synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's query builder or the GraphQL API. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use query builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

In this guide, you learn how to: Use the nr1 CLI to generate a default visualization Run your visualization locally where you can quickly test and iterate Publish your visualization to the New Relic One catalog Add your visualization to a dashboard Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create a new visualization Use nr1 to generate the boilerplate for a new visualization. Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called my-awesome-visualization, in a Nerdpack, called my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name my-awesome-visualization ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ... my-awesome-nerdpack ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-awesome-nerdpack is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization my-awesome-visualization is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another. Step 4 of 4 In index.js, change your component's Radar.fillOpacity: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 } from 'recharts'; 10 import {Card, CardBody, HeadingText, NrqlQuery, Spinner, AutoSizer} from 'nr1'; 11 12 export default class MyAwesomeVisualizationVisualization extends React.Component { 13 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 14 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One app catalog. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl.

Step 3 of 8 Serve your Nerdpack locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve If you're still serving your Nerdpack from the last lesson, you need to stop it with CTRL-X and serve it again to reflect changes to nr1.json. Step 4 of 8 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The nerdpacks=local query string directs the UI to load your visualization from the local server. Step 5 of 8 Open the Apps page: Step 6 of 8 Go to Custom Visualizations, which is favorited by default: Step 7 of 8 In Custom Visualizations, find and click your visualization: Step 8 of 8 Notice the new Select chart configuration option: Selecting a chart type doesn't effect your visualization. This is because you first need to introduce the selectedChart property to the visualization component. Then, you use selectedChart to determine the chart type to render. Replace your SegmentedControl with the configurable property Step 1 of 5 Open your visualization's index.js file. You'll be working here for the rest of the guide.

      "info": "Build a \"Hello, World!\" app and publish it to New Relic One",
      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in the New Relic One Catalog, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the New Relic One catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published to the catalog, you can view it by visiting the Apps page of New Relic: From the catalog UI, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top right of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app in the catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One app catalog. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another. Step 4 of 4 In index.js, change your component's Radar.fillOpacity: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 } from 'recharts'; 10 import {Card, CardBody, HeadingText, NrqlQuery, Spinner, AutoSizer} from 'nr1'; 11 12 export default class MyAwesomeVisualizationVisualization extends React.Component { 13 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 14 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Before you begin Explore our custom visualization guides and build your first visualization.

The SegmentedControl and RadarChart are at the top of the view, but if you scroll down, you'll see your new Treemap: Switch between charts with your component's state Use state.selectedChart to determine which chart to show: the RadarChart or the Treemap. Step 1 of 1 Destructure this.state to access selectedChart as a separate constant. Then, compare selectedChart to CHART_TYPES.Radar. If they are the same, render a RadarChart. Otherwise, render a Treemap: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 'Radar': 'radar', 24 'Treemap': 'treemap' 25 } 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in the New Relic One Catalog, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Fetch data from a third-party service, before starting this one. In this course, you're building a New Relic One application. This application shows telemetry data from a demo service that is running an A/B test so that it can reveal that data in charts, like a dashboard. Your New Relic application is different than a dashboard, however, because it does more than show New Relic data. It pulls external data, provides UI components and functionality, and even has its own small data stores. The purpose of this New Relic application is to present context so you can better understand the A/B test results and how those results tie in to your business objectives. So far, you've built all your charts, organized them for improved usability, provided them with real data, and more. There are some final improvements you can make, using Platform API components. In this lesson, you learn how to use values in the New Relic platform state. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-platform-state-context/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, add a PlatformStateContext.Consumer to your NewsletterSignups component's render() method: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Notice that NrqlQuery uses a constant called ACCOUNT_ID. Instead of hardcoding an account identifier in your Nerdlet, you can use accountId from the platform URL state. Step 3 of 10 PlatformStateContext.Consumer provides access to the platform's URL state. This context contains an important value you'll use in your app, called timeRange. Notice that your NrqlQuery uses a SINCE clause that identifies the historical timeframe your query should fetch data from. Right now, that SINCE clause is set to 30 MINUTES AGO. With timeRange, you can use the platform's time picker to make this timeframe adjustable. Step 4 of 10 Utilize the platform state's timeRange: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, NewsletterSignups uses platformState.timeRange instead of a hardcoded SINCE clause. While NrqlQuery components accept a convenient timeRange prop, not every component does. You can still use timeRange in other contexts by accessing duration, begin_time, or end_time: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { console.log(platformState.timeRange.duration); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>; Copy Step 5 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test. Step 6 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 7 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 10 View your application: Your NrqlQuery now uses the platform state's timeRange, but your chart probably still shows the last 30 minutes. Why? Where does the timeRange in platform state come from? The time picker sits on the right side of your application's navigation bar: Change this value and see your chart update: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 9 of 10 Update VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Of all the charts in your New Relic One application, these three charts are the ones that should update with the time picker. The others, Total subscriptions per version, Total cancellations per version, Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions, Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, show total values over time. So, hardcoding their SINCE clauses to 7 DAYS AGO makes sense, as this is a reasonable time period for the purposes of this course. Step 10 of 10 While still serving your Nerdpack locally, view your NR1 app to see your charts updating with the time range you choose: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now that you're basing your queries off the platform state, some of your charts are dynamic in their time ranges. This is a great improvement because it allows you to adjust your charts to show data from any particular point in time, which is useful for tying data to business outcomes. The Platform API components offer a lot more functionality, too, including the ability to navigate the user to another place in New Relic. You'll learn how to do this in the next lesson.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorage from your nerdlet, before starting this one. Throughout this course, you're building a New Relic One application that gathers telemetry data from a demo web service that's running an A/B test on a newsletter signup form. The purpose of your New Relic One application is to help you understand how design changes impact the number of high quality newsletter subscriptions your service gets. The business objective, to increase your service's high quality newsletter subscriptions, relies primarily on three key pieces of information: Number of page views per version Number of subscriptions per version Number of cancellations Cancellations are important because if one design version of your newsletter signup form results in a high number of subscriptions but also a high number of cancellations, then those subscriptions are not as valuable. In previous lessons, you gathered data for page views and subscriptions from New Relic's database (NRDB), but you still need cancellation data. Your demo application does not report cancellation data to New Relic, so you need to fetch that data from an external source. We've provided a service at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations to return fake cancellation data for the purposes of this course. If you visit this URL in your browser, you'll see a brief message: \"Unauthorized\". This is because we created this service with a requirement that whoever requests its data must pass an Authorization header with the bearer token ABC123. So before you can request cancellation data from api.nerdsletter.net, you need to implement a few new behaviors in your application: Provide a mechanism for inputting an authorization token Persist the authorization token in a secure data store To input your authorization token, you'll use a Modal with a TextField. The secure data store you'll use is called NerdStorageVault. It's different from NerdStorage, which you used in the last lesson, because it only supports user storage and encrypts its data. Store your API token Step 1 of 3 Change to the add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 3 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, initialize state in AbTestNerdletNerdlet with a null token default: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Your Nerdlet uses this token state to manage the authorization token you'll later pass to the third-party service. However, a component's state is not a long-term solution for data management. For that, you need NerdStorageVault. Step 3 of 3 Implement a method, called storeToken(), which mutates NerdStorageVault data, and bind that method to the AbTestNerdletNerdlet instance: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy When you call storeToken() with a new token value, your Nerdlet uses NerdGraph APIs to mutate NerdStorageVault data for the api_token key. If the request to NerdGraph is successful, storeToken() updates state.token so that the new token is locally accessible. Unlike NerdStorage, which has query and mutation components for your convenience, NerdStorageVault has no components in the SDK. Instead, you have to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to interact with it Important It's important to remember that NerdStorageVault is limited to the user scope. Any other users of your New Relic One application will have their own NerdStorageVault data. This means that even other users on your account will need to enter their token separately. Query your API token Step 1 of 2 First, create methods and state to show and hide your API token prompt: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy state.hideTokenPrompt determines whether or not the prompt is visible. Now, you need a mechanism for revealing the prompt, which is hidden by default. Step 2 of 2 Query NerdStorageVault for your api_token: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, in componentDidMount(), you've queried NerdGraph for your api_token data. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that's called when your component is mounted in the component tree. This means that early in it's setup process, your application will request your api_token. If the NerdGraph query responds successfully with your token from NerdStorageVault, it sets the token in state. Otherwise, it shows the prompt so that you can enter a token. This is great for storing an initial token, but what if you enter the wrong token or the API changes? You need a way reveal the prompt on-demand. Next, you'll create the actual token prompt and a button to manually invoke the prompt. Create your token prompt Step 1 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named token-prompt.js: bash Copy $ touch token-prompt.js Step 2 of 9 In this new file, create a button that allows you to enter a new token on demand: import React from 'react'; import { Button } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenButton receives showPrompt() in its props and calls that method when its Button is clicked. Step 3 of 9 Create a token prompt using a Modal with a TextField: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenPrompt renders a Modal with a TextField, a Button, and an explanatory prompt. You use the Modal to enter your API token. It also provides basic error handling if you try to submit the form with no token value. It's important to distinguish the token in AbTestNerdletNerdlet.state and the token in ApiTokenPrompt.state. The token in your Nerdlet's state is the current token that your Nerdlet knows about. It's this token that matches what's in NerdStorageVault. The token in ApiTokenPrompt.state is a fluid value that changes as you update the text in the TextField. When you press Submit in the modal, ApiTokenPrompt submits its token to your Nerdlet's storeToken() method. Then, storeToken() mutates NerdStorageVault with the new token. You also implemented a few methods to improve the user experience: keyPress() submits the token when the RETURN key is pressed showTokenError() and hideTokenError() remind the user that they must enter a token before submitting the form Step 4 of 9 Export your components, so you can use them in your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } export { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import ApiTokenButton and ApiTokenPrompt and add them to render(): import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; import { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } from './token-prompt'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you visit your application for the first time, the prompt is automatically revealed. Enter \"ABC123\" in the TextField, as that's the token that the third-party service expects. Once you submit your token and your Nerdlet hides the prompt, click Update API token at the bottom of your New Relic One application to reveal it again: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Pass your API token to TotalCancellations Step 1 of 3 In index.js, pass the API token to TotalCancellations so you're prepared to make a request to the third-party service: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; import { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } from './token-prompt'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <TotalCancellations token={this.state.token} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 2 of 3 In total-cancellations.js, log the token to your browser console: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { lastToken: null } } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) this.setState({lastToken: this.props.token}) } } render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy Here, you've implemented another React lifecycle method, called componentDidUpdate(). Now, every time your Nerdlet's state.token changes, TotalCancellations gets a new token prop, which triggers componentDidUpdate(). In componentDidUpdate(), you check that the incoming token is not the same as the last token it knew about, which is stored in local state. If the incoming token is different, you log a message with the new token and update state.lastToken. This logic prepares your code for a future change to use your API token in a request to a third-party service. Step 3 of 3 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see the log from TotalCancellations in your browser's console: If you change your token, you'll see another log from TotalCancellations with your updated token. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now you know how to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to manage data in NerdStorageVault! Remember, use NerdStorage for your New Relic One application's non-sensitive data and NerdStorageVault for the sensitive stuff like tokens, passwords, and other secrets. As a bonus, you created a way to manage your token in NerdStorageVault from the user interface. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component for later use. Whether it's been with NrqlQuery, AccountStorageQuery, AccountStorageMutation, NerdGraphQuery, or NerdGraphMutation, you've learned several ways to interact with New Relic data in your New Relic One application. But New Relic One applications aren't just another way to show New Relic data. The purpose of New Relic One applications is to show you how your software is helping you meet your business objectives. Sometimes, New Relic data is all you need to make that happen, but other times you need to look beyond New Relic for data to fill in the gaps.

      "body": "Problem JavaScript (JS) error events are compiled on the browser monitoring JS errors page. By default, they’re grouped by error message. When you select a single error event, you’ll see more detail in its Error Instances list. In some cases, one or more of the instances may not have a stack trace. Tip Instead, you’ll see the message, \"This error is likely coming from a third-party site and no stack trace is available.\" Solution Enabling cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) can eliminate this issue, exposing the full details of the JS error to your application and allowing the error's stack trace to be captured by the browser agent. There are many online resources that provide information on CORS enabling and settings. This MDN article has a detailed description of CORS, with a section on configuring response headers, and another on CORS settings attributes. The Enable CORS website has information how to enable CORS for various platforms. New Relic is not responsible for the accuracy of third-party websites. Caution This document is intended only as a general introduction to using CORS. Due to possible security concerns, we recommend research before implementing any changes that impact the security of your application or resources. The optimal CORS implementation will depend on the systems you are using and your security considerations. Here are general instructions on how to implement CORS: Add the Access-Control-Allow-Origin code to the response headers of any third-party assets that provide JavaScript to your app: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: YOUR_DOMAIN Copy Setting a domain, or multiple domains, will give those specific domains access to error trace details and other available resources. This MDN article may contain useful information on configuring response headers, such as adding multiple domains or using a wildcard in lieu of a domain. In your application, have the browser load JavaScript files using the CORS crossorigin attribute: <script src=\"EXTERNAL_LOCATION/script.js\" crossorigin> </script> Copy This MDN article may contain useful information on CORS settings attributes. Cause The most common cause of the missing stack trace problem is the same-origin policy. This is a security policy that prevents one web resource from accessing data from another resource unless they both have the same origin. In this context, origin is the combination of the URI scheme, the hostname, and the port number. The policy prevents malicious code from gaining access to other web resources. The same-origin policy is important for internet security, but it can make it more difficult for web resources to work together. Specifically, issues can arise if you have JS scripts hosted on Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) or other external locations. New Relic is able to see the errors coming from those scripts but is unable to access their data.",

Scope of support You can have confidence that the Products we make Generally Available are fully tested with the compatible environments outlined in New Relic Documentation. New Relic’s Global Technical Support provides assistance with the New Relic One Platform, and the features and capabilities inherent in the Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability, and Applied Intelligence Product lines. For issues within Third Party tools, or when tools in your infrastructure aren't working together properly, Global Technical Support may reach a point where we must refer New Relic users to such Third Party or community for assistance. Support includes Troubleshooting problems on the New Relic One Platform Assistance with issues during installation & upgrade in compatible environments Guidance on implementation and configuration in compatible environments Troubleshooting problems with ingesting data into New Relic General usage and best practice guidelines Identifying bugs with New Relic Products Assistance in English or Japanese Only (Japanese customer Terms of Service) Support does not include Unsupported or incompatible environments & frameworks Our Products are fully tested with the compatible environments and installation frameworks, and we’re here to help you through issues that may arise with our Products within these compatible environments and frameworks. We cannot support installation or configuration of our Products in environments or frameworks that do not meet established compatibility requirements. But if you're looking for help customizing New Relic for your particular environment, New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Software customizations We are eager to help troubleshoot issues with the Products and features we make generally available, and those categorized as New Relic’s Open Source Community Plus Projects. New Relic’s Global Technical Support does not support customizations, modifications, or extensions to our code. Customizations or extensions to New Relic’s Open Source Projects in other Project categories are supported by the developer community in GitHub. New Relic’s Expert Services is a team of highly skilled consultants that can assist with unique configurations or environments. Custom applications With New Relic One, users have the ability to extend beyond the curated dashboards and design custom applications tailored to your business. New Relic’s Global Technical Support team does not support custom applications. The New Relic Developer site provides guidance on building custom apps, and here are a growing number of open source apps that you can use to get started. Custom scripts & queries We are happy to help troubleshoot issues related to the New Relic One platform that may be causing issues with a script or query. We cannot provide solutions for specific script or query use cases. New Relic Documentation and New Relic University offer resources on how to construct custom scripts and queries.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add user interface components to your application, before starting this one. In previous hands-on lessons, you created all the charts from your design guide. Unfortunately, they aren’t laid out like they are in the design. The New Relic One SDK provides multiple solutions for organizing your components. The one you’ll learn about in this lesson is the Grid component. To arrange your charts, place them in a Grid. A Grid is a container you use to organize your content into 12-column rows. A GridItem is the building block for a Grid. You specify the columnSpan of a GridItem between 1 and 12 to determine how much of the row that the GridItem should cover. So, if you want a chart to stretch across the width of the view, you would place the chart in a GridItem with a columnSpan of 12. If you want twelve charts to fit in a single row, use a columnSpan of 1. Using the design guide as a base, you can plan how to organize your Grid: Once you’ve planned out how you’re going to arrange your columns, you can write some code to realize your plans. Step 1 of 6 Change to the add-a-grid/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import Grid and GridItem. Then, update your Nerdlet's render() method by placing each chart in a GrildItem. Finally, place all your items in a Grid: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy The columnSpan for each chart matches the layout plan. Every chart that takes up half the 12-column row has a columnSpan of 6, and every chart that takes up the whole row has a columnSpan of 12. Notice that each of the charts in the ChartGroup, but not the ChartGroup itself, is in a GridItem. A ChartGroup connects charts' behaviors, not their locations. Each chart fills its columnSpan because they use the fullWidth prop. fullWidth makes the chart fill its available horizontal space and GridItem.columnSpan restricts that space to some fraction of the row. Remove a fullWidth prop, and see how the chart reacts. Technical detail Notice the wrapper class applied to the Grid. We quietly provided some CSS styles to help make this app look great! This isn't a CSS course, so we won't cover everything we added, we'll just include the styles we intend for you to use in the code snippets. Just know that every UI component in the New Relic One SDK provides a className prop where you can provide a CSS class name. You can view the styles in nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see your charts styled and arranged in a grid. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. In just six steps, you significantly improved the readability and usability of your A/B test application, but you can take further steps to improve the usability of your charts. In the next lesson, you’ll add headings to your charts to remind yourself of what data each chart presents. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. When you're ready, continue on to the next lesson: Add chart headings.",

With your charts organized and descriptive headings above each one, your New Relic One application is becoming more usable. In this lesson, you'll continue that trend by creating descriptions for each design version in your A/B test. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-version-descriptions/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-version-descriptions/ab-test Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named description.js: bash Copy $ touch description.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a new React component, called VersionDescription, which uses a HeadingText and a BlockText to render a version description that you pass, using the description prop: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, HeadingText } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionDescription extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return ( <div> <HeadingText className=\"versionHeader\"> Version {this.props.version} </HeadingText> <BlockText className=\"versionText\"> {this.props.description} </BlockText> </div> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/description.js Copy You'll use this one class to create a version description for each design version in your A/B test.

You passed the description and version props, which correspond to a design version. You also added a horizontal rule to visually separate the descriptions from the charts in your app. For this, you added a GridItem with a columnSpan of 12, to stretch the rule the full width of the grid. Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-version-descriptions/ab-test.

      "body": "Taking some time to consider your headings and document titles will be time well spent. Titles and headings are not only important for search results, but they can make your docs easier to skim. For all headings and document titles, use sentence case. Use parallel construction Use parallel construction when naming headers. For example, use all nouns (\"Organization,\" \"Tone\"), all verbs (\"Create,\" \"Delete\"), etc. Keep it short, avoid -ing words For all headers, keep the title as short as possible. In particular, avoid headers that are more than a line long. As with all our writing, you should feel free to address the reader directly: Install the agent, for example, rather than Agent installation. You should also avoid -ing words, which add to character count without contributing clarity. Do not use h1 headings After you publish your doc, the Docs site will automatically use what you added to the Title field as the doc's level one heading (h1). To ensure that your doc is properly indexed for search, do not manually create additional h1 headings. If your doc's title is long and you would like a shorter title to appear in the sidebar menu, create a GitHub issue and we'll help you with that change. Use level two headings to identify chunks of information Organize chunks of information into sections with level two headings (##). For example: ## Create a new user [#create-new-user] Copy Important If you don't specify an ID manually, the site will use your header text as that header's ID (also known as anchor link). Create a manual ID to preserve links to that header if you change the header text. If you have too many level sections, consider splitting the document into multiple pages. Avoid using level three headings Avoid using ### headings unless it makes sense for the content or if the content is lengthy. Collapsers, tables, and other structural elements are often a better choice. Be particularly careful about level three headings that make a level two section longer than a single screen height. Here are two examples of good scenarios for using level three headings: Example #1: Events-to-metrics API doc Example #2: Infrastructure integration doc",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add version descriptions, before starting this one. In this course, you’re building an A/B test application in New Relic. The application presents a lot of data, through its charts, about the effectiveness of each design version you’re testing on your demo website. Ultimately, you’ll be able to use that data to decide which design is most effective and show that design to every user who visits your site. In this lesson, you’ll build a form into your application that lets you choose which design you want to show to every user of your site. Before writing any code, look at your design guide to review the section you’re going to build: This new section has three main components: A heading with instructional copy: \"Pick a version to end the test\" A component that you use to crown the winning version of the A/B test A button to confirm the winner that you selected Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-end-test-section/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named end-test.js: bash Copy $ touch end-test.js Step 3 of 10 In this new file, create a VersionSelector component to encapsulate a Select and its SelectItem child components: import React from 'react'; import { Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy VersionSelector renders a Select component with two choices. In each SelectItem, you specify a value prop. In this case, you use 'A' to represent version A and 'B' to represent version B. Step 4 of 10 Create another component for a Button you'll use to make your test as ended: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy This looks trivial, but it will encapsulate button logic as you iterate on your app code. Step 5 of 10 Create a final component for the entire section you'll use to mark the end of your test: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you create a Grid with three items. First, you create a GridItem that contains a HeadingText and spans all 12 columns. In the next row, you have two items: The VersionSelector component you created in the previous step A Button which reads \"End test\" These items each span one column, but instead of using columnSpan, they use a combination of columnStart and columnEnd to specify which columns they cover. Step 6 of 10 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, add EndTestSection to your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. However, you need to make a few improvements to this code. When you select a version, the selected value in the component doesn't change. You must control the value that Select displays using its value prop and onChange event handler. In the next lesson, you’ll update your code to persist your version choice in the Select component.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Persist the selected version, before starting this one. In this tutorial, you're building an A/B test application. The application surfaces data about an ongoing A/B test on your website, which you then use to decide which page design version is most effective at engaging users. As part of that overarching goal, you're building a section which allows you to end the test by deciding a winner of the experiment: Unfortunately, there are a few issues with the code and design for this section. By the end of this course, pressing End test will tell your website's backend server that every customer should see the version selected here. This is destructive behavior because it makes an irreversible change to your website. To account for the desctructiveness of pressing End test, you need to modify some features of your application: Make the button look important to catch your eye Prompt yourself with a confirmation message before ending the test to ensure you don't end it prematurely Show and hide your confirmation modal Step 1 of 12 Change to the present-confirmation-modal/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test This directory contains the code your application should have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 12 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, update the Button to use the DESTRUCTIVE styling: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Tip Read more about Button and its props on the New Relic developer site. Step 3 of 12 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test. Step 4 of 12 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 12 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 12 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: Now you've styled your button to convey its destructive consequences, but that's not enough to prevent you from accidentally clicking it. Next, you create a shield for your website's backend. This extra layer of protection requires you to confirm that you intend to end the test before actually doing so. Step 7 of 12 Add a Modal to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Your new modal contains a heading, a confirmation message, the winning design version, and two buttons. You'll explore some of these components later in this course. With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your new Modal: Tip Remember, while your server is running, it will update automatically when you save your code. The modal looks great, but it has three issues: It was present before you clicked End test You can't dismiss it It always says you selected \"Version A\", even if you didn't In the following steps, you'll correct all three of these issues. Step 8 of 12 In EndTestButton, initialize state with a value for modalHidden: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy modalHidden determines whether or not to hide the modal. The default value of modalHidden is true because you only want to show the modal when you select End test. Step 9 of 12 Supply modalHidden to the Modal: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy First, you've created a constructor to accept component props. This provides your component access to the modalHidden prop that you passed in EndTestSection. Then you provide the value of modalHidden to the Modal component's hidden prop. Tip Read more about Modal and its props on the New Relic developer site. Step 10 of 12 Add and bind two new methods to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Use closeModal and showModal to close and show your modal, respectively, depending on how a user interacts with the modal. Step 11 of 12 Show the modal when you click End test: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you've supplied showModal() as the callback for the Button component's onClick event. Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. The modal is hidden by default. Click End test to see the modal. Step 12 of 12 Close the modal from the Modal component's onClose callback and from the Yes, end test and No, continue test buttons: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Click End test. The modal opens and displays your confirmation message. Close the modal by clicking X at the top right, either of its buttons, or even in the dark space to its left. Notice that the modal says you chose \"Version A\", even if you choose \"Version B\". This is because \"Version A\" is hardcoded in the Modal text. Next, you'll make that dynamic. Use the version you selected in your modal Step 1 of 2 In EndTestSection, pass selectedVersion to the EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Now, you can access the selected version from the EndTestButton component's props. Step 2 of 2 Use selectedVersion in your confirmation message: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Select \"Version B\" from the menu. Click End test to see \"Version B\" in the confirmation modal: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Congratulations! You've done a lot of work and it shows in the usefulness of your application. You've created charts that show mocked data. You've organized your charts into a readable structure. You've added an interface for your users to interact with the test. Now, you need some real data. In the next lesson, you'll replace the mocked data in your charts with real data from your backend service.

      "body": "Mobile app crashes can result in users submitting negative reviews, which can affect your organization's reputation. Crashes can also result in users deleting your app altogether, which affects your organization's profitability. With the Crash analysis UI, you can identify and deal with one of the largest bottlenecks in the development lifecycle: the time it takes to resolve unanticipated exceptions. Use crash analysis features When your development team receives an emailed crash notification, they can select the email link to review detailed information about the crash in our user interface, or analyze chart data directly through a query. The individual Crash details page also includes tracking tools for your team to follow the issue from reporting to resolution. Our crash analysis feature helps developers to: Slice and dice your crash and network data (using groups and filters) to analyze trends leading to the crash. Understand a particular user's experience by using a custom attribute. Pinpoint when most crashes occur; for example, by filtering by Last Interaction, or by viewing the interaction trail in the Crash report page. Align issues with common characteristics in networks or devices. Examine specific problems in a crash report that may be buried in thread breakdown data, trace details, or the trail of user interactions in the crashed session. Quickly see trends from the Crash profiles tab. View the crash list To view the filterable Crash list in the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Crash analysis. OR To view the filterable Crash analysis page directly from the mobile app's Overview page, select the Crash occurrences chart's title. Use any of our standard page functions to drill down into detailed information; for example, zoom into any area of a chart. Use the crash analysis workflow To get the most out of mobile monitoring's Crash analysis UI, use this basic workflow. Start with the Crash rate percentage and Crash-free users percentage charts to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with crash time frames, or uneventful periods within the selected time period. Use the groups and filters to examine attributes (for crashes, devices, locations, or other custom attributes) in more detail. Use the Top 5 occurrences chart to identify patterns for the type of occurrence you selected from the groups and filters. Also correlate any general patterns for the selected type of occurrence to crash percentages that occurred during this time period. Optional: Query or share the chart data. Look for patterns in the Crash location table information, including location, exception type, date and number of occurrences, version, and number of users affected by the crash. Select a crash report from the table to view its interaction trail, its event trail, thread details for individual occurrences, attributes, and more. If necessary, resymbolicate or export the crash details to Xcode so you can debug your source code more easily. When finished, mark the crash occurrences as Resolved. Resolved crashes include a banner identifying who resolved the crash and when. Based on mobile monitoring's data retention policies, you can filter by resolved crashes when you need to track back to historical information. Crash percentages charts: See patterns immediately. Start with the Crash rate percentage and Crash-free users percentage charts to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with crashes in general. For example: Are there any spikes near a recent version release? Is there a time period when the percentage of users has been affected significantly by the crash? (If the Crash-free users percentage chart is empty, there were no user sessions during the selected time period.) Groups and filters: Slice and dice the crash data. You can select a group, and then filter to specific data, including: Group the crash list by type of crash, device, location, or other custom attributes. Show open crashes, resolved crashes, or all crashes. Use the time picker to adjust the currently selected time period. Filter by a specific Version or by one or more attribute Filter, such as Last Interaction, App Build, or any of the longer list of standard and custom attributes). The selected filters appear at the top of the UI page. Top five occurrences: Analyze specific characteristics. Use the Top 5 occurrences chart to identify what types of crashes and how many occurred during the selected time period. This chart shows the top five crash occurrences by the group and filters you select. For example, you can group by email address (if instrumented as a custom attribute), then filter down to a specific email to examine that user's experience. To filter or group by other attributes, use the search window, or select any of the available filters. For example, filter by type of crash, device, a specific location, or any custom attributes. To look for other historical patterns, change the selected time period. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Crash analysis: Here is an example of the Top 5 occurrences chart filtered by the Crash locations group. Select any groups or filters to analyze your crash data any way you want. Queries and image links: Query crash data and share charts with others. Mobile monitoring's Crash analysis charts use default attributes for mobile events, along with any custom attributes you have added to this event type. To view or share the data, click the ellipsis icon. Add to dashboard link: View the chart, and copy it to a new or existing dashboard. View query link: View the NRQL query used to calculate the chart data. Get as image link: Select this option to get a public URL of the chart, then share it using any media. Crash reports: Dive into the interaction trail, thread breakdown, and more. Supplementing the charts, the Crash report table lists crash types by location, and links them to relevant crash report details. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this crash type or exception occurred within the selected time period? What is the most recent exception message? Does a specific app version have a higher (or lower) number of users affected? When did the exception first and last occur? one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Crash analysis: Sort on any column to analyze patterns in the Crash reports table, then select any report to review crash details. Sometimes it may be more useful to examine crash report data from lowest to highest. For example: Which exception has the fewest number of occurrences? When did a particular exception start (Earliest occurrence)? You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of exceptions that matter the most to you and your teams.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you learned of a third-party service that you can use to fetch mock cancellation data for the Total cancellations per version chart in your New Relic One application. Even though the data in this service is fake, the real value of this lesson is learning how you can use third party services to supply data to your New Relic One application. If you make a request to the mock service with cancellation data (https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations) you'll see a response rejecting your request with a message that reads \"Unauthorized\": bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations Unauthorized This is because the Nerdsletter API requires an Authorization header. More specifically, you must pass a bearer token of ABC123 to gain authorized access to its data. If you make a request to the service with the header Authorization: Bearer ABC123, you'll get a successful response with the mocked cancellation data: bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations -H 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' {\"a\": 15, \"b\": 78} In the last lesson, you used NerdGraph to store this API token in your New Relic One application's NerdStorageVault data store. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component and logged its use to your browser's console. In this lesson, you follow up that log statement with a real request to the Nerdsletter API using your authorization token. Then, you supply the data from that external resource to your Total cancellations per version chart. Step 1 of 6 Change to the third-party-services/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/third-party-services/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 6 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js, make a request to api.nerdsletter.net with your API token. Save the results to state, and use that state in render(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { cancellations: [], lastToken: null } } generateChartData(data) { const cancellationsA = data ? data.a : 0; const cancellationsB = data ? data.b : 0; return [ { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsA }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsB }, ], }, ] } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`Requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) fetch( \"https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations\", {headers: {\"Authorization\": `Bearer ${this.props.token}`}} ).then( (response) => { if (response.status == 200) { return response.json() } else if (response.status == 401) { console.error(\"Incorrect auth header\") } else { console.error(response.text()) } } ).then( (data) => { if (data) { this.setState({ cancellations: this.generateChartData(data), lastToken: this.props.token }) } } ) } } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={this.state.cancellations} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy In this code, you initialize TotalCancellations.state.cancellations with zero for the y-value in each series instead of the previously hardcoded values. This helps to more realistically represent what the chart should show if your New Relic One app hasn't successfully requested data from the Nerdsletter API. Next, you use Javascript's fetch() function to make an HTTP request to the Nerdsletter API. You then pass your token in the request's Authorization header. If the request is successful, you update the cancellation data in TotalCancellations.state so that that data is reflected in the component's render method. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/third-party-service/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. If your token in NerdStorageVault is not \"ABC123\", then your console will show an error that reads, \"Incorrect auth header\": If you set the token to \"ABC123\", then Total cancellations per version updates to show the values from the third-party service: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great job! You've come a long way from running nr1 nerdpack:create for the first time. Take a look back at your design guide to see that your application now has everything from an interface and data perspective that you planned from the beginning: You've created eight charts with varying styles and supplied them with dynamic data from multiple sources. You've learned about the New Relic One SDK and used many of its components. You've even gathered data from a third-party service and mixed it seemlessly with your New Relic data to provide a complete look at how the competing versions in your A/B test perform against each other. From here, there is only one more set of APIs in the New Relic One SDK that you've yet to get your hands on: Platform APIs. These will come in handy in improving the usability of your New Relic One application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize NRQL data, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { this[index] = { endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, } }, data ) historicalData.data = data return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data, format it according to the TableChart specifications, and set it on historicalData.data. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add a grid, before starting this one. Organizing charts is one way to clarify the information you're trying to convey to your users. Headings are another. Since you have several charts on the same page, use headings to describe the information they show. To remember what data each chart presents, consult your design guide: The design guide details what data each chart shows. Use those details to craft useful headings for your charts. Step 1 of 6 Change to the add-chart-headings/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-chart-headings/ab-test Step 2 of 6 In newsletter-signups.js, page-views.js, past-tests.js, total-cancellations.js, total-subscriptions.js, and totals.js, import HeadingText and add a descriptive heading above the chart in each of your custom components: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } const versionBSignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-b-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 20 }, { x: 10, y: 5 }, { x: 20, y: 25 }, { x: 30, y: 45 }, { x: 40, y: 50 }, { x: 50, y: 35 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionASignups, versionBSignups]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [ { \"endDate\": \"12-15-2020\", \"versionADescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was green.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was blue.\", \"winner\": \"A\" }, { \"endDate\": \"09-06-2019\", \"versionADescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a carousel.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a grid.\", \"winner\": \"B\" } ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { const versionATotals = { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[versionATotals]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Notice the new <div> tag in each render(), which allows you to return multiple elements at once. Also, remember that we provided you a CSS stylesheet that styles the chartHeader class. You can look at nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss to see more. You don't need to modify your Nerdlet's render() method in index.js because your components encapsulate the new code. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see that your charts have descriptive headings. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Well done! You've created all the charts that are laid out in your design guide. You’ve also organized them into a neat grid and added headings so that the charts are intelligible. While chart headings helps you understand what each chart shows, it'd be nice to add descriptions to help you remember what each version in your A/B test represents. In the next lesson, you'll add a description for each design version. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add version descriptions, before starting this one. In this course, you’re building an A/B test application in New Relic. The application presents a lot of data, through its charts, about the effectiveness of each design version you’re testing on your demo website. Ultimately, you’ll be able to use that data to decide which design is most effective and show that design to every user who visits your site. In this lesson, you’ll build a form into your application that lets you choose which design you want to show to every user of your site. Before writing any code, look at your design guide to review the section you’re going to build: This new section has three main components: A heading with instructional copy: \"Pick a version to end the test\" A component that you use to crown the winning version of the A/B test A button to confirm the winner that you selected Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-end-test-section/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named end-test.js: bash Copy $ touch end-test.js Step 3 of 10 In this new file, create a VersionSelector component to encapsulate a Select and its SelectItem child components: import React from 'react'; import { Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy VersionSelector renders a Select component with two choices. In each SelectItem, you specify a value prop. In this case, you use 'A' to represent version A and 'B' to represent version B. Step 4 of 10 Create another component for a Button you'll use to make your test as ended: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy This looks trivial, but it will encapsulate button logic as you iterate on your app code. Step 5 of 10 Create a final component for the entire section you'll use to mark the end of your test: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you create a Grid with three items. First, you create a GridItem that contains a HeadingText and spans all 12 columns. In the next row, you have two items: The VersionSelector component you created in the previous step A Button which reads \"End test\" These items each span one column, but instead of using columnSpan, they use a combination of columnStart and columnEnd to specify which columns they cover. Step 6 of 10 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, add EndTestSection to your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. However, you need to make a few improvements to this code. When you select a version, the selected value in the component doesn't change. You must control the value that Select displays using its value prop and onChange event handler. In the next lesson, you’ll update your code to persist your version choice in the Select component. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Persist the selected version.",

      "body": "This document contains detailed descriptions of resources and procedures that are referenced in the New Relic .NET agent install procedures. Important This document is not meant to be read as a standalone document. For install instructions, see Introduction to .NET agent install. Microsoft's .NET profiler New Relic’s .NET agent relies on the Microsoft profiling API to report data from your .NET application. .NET monitoring solutions other than New Relic can use this profiling API. But only one service can use the profiler at a time. This means that if you have used a .NET monitoring service in the past and haven’t completely disabled/removed it, the profiler may still be in use, which will cause profiler conflicts when you try to enable the .NET agent. .NET agent download library The New Relic .NET agent download library contains install file packages that are referenced in specific install procedures. For more on these files, see the download library’s ReadMe file. Zip files for manual .NET agent install (Windows) To manually install the agent using a ZIP file, choose the correct file for the application you wish to monitor: Go to the .NET agent download site and get the file matching your application's runtime and architecture: .NET Framework (32-bit): newrelic-agent-win-x86-VERSION.zip .NET Framework (64-bit): newrelic-agent-win-x64-VERSION.zip .NET Core (32-bit): newrelic-netcore20-agent-win-x86-VERSION.zip .NET Core (64-bit): newrelic-netcore20-agent-win-x64-VERSION.zip Unzip the agent folder in the desired location. Set environment variables for the process you wish to monitor. Caution We do not recommend setting these environment variables globally. Setting these environment variables globally can cause all .NET processes running on the system to get instrumented and report to New Relic. If you are installing the agent manually, we expect that you have the means to set these environment variables only for the processes you wish to monitor. .NET Framework environment variables for manual install For .NET Framework, the following variables are required: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory COR_PROFILER_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll Copy .NET Core environment variables for manual install For .NET Core, the following variables are required: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory\\NewRelic.Profiler.dll Copy Restart your application. If using IIS, restart IIS. If your application is receiving traffic, data should appear within a few minutes. If it doesn't, see No data appears. Need for custom instrumentation After installing a .NET agent, most .NET application frameworks will automatically report data to your New Relic account. (See app framework compatibility: .NET Framework | .NET Core.) If your .NET application uses an application framework that is not automatically instrumented, or if the app has no framework (like a console app), after the install you will need to manually set up instrumentation of your app. Here are the steps to do that: Follow the relevant install instructions for your application and framework. Custom instrument your application to define what activity is reported to New Relic. Install-related environment variables A .NET agent install requires setting environment variables. For some install procedures (like for IIS-hosted .NET applications), these environment variables are set automatically. For other install procedures, you will have to manually set them. To see the required environment variables for both .NET Framework and .NET Core applications, see Environment variables. For installations requiring you to manually set environment variables, you can also set other configuration options via environment variables. Here's a look at two that are commonly set: License key. The environment variable for setting the New Relic license key is: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY = YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy You can also set this in the newrelic.config file or the app's config file. App name. Setting a meaningful application name is recommended, but you can also set this after install. The environment variable is: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME = YOUR_APP_NAME Copy You can also set this via the newrelic.config, the app's config file, or the API. Scriptable installers (Windows only) The scriptable installers are ZIP archives containing a PowerShell script for installing the .NET agent. There is a separate zip archive for .NET Framework versus .NET Core. Important We recommend using the MSI installer over the scriptable installer. If you want to automate your install, consider running the MSI installer from the command line. Scriptable installer for .NET Framework To use the scriptable installer to install the .NET agent for a .NET Framework app: Ensure you have administrator rights for your Windows admin group. For more details on this, see the permissions documentation. Download the scriptable installer package for .NET Framework from the download site. By downloading or using one of these packages, you agree to and accept the license terms. Unzip the package. Open a command shell and navigate into the unzipped package's folder. For a simple install with no options, use this command: .\\install.cmd -LicenseKey YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy To install with one or more additional options, use the format below. See table below for a description of the install options. install.cmd -LicenseKey YOUR_LICENSE_KEY [-NoIISReset] [-InstrumentAll] [-InstallPath PATH_TO_INSTALL] Copy If your application is receiving traffic, data should appear within a few minutes. If it doesn't, see No data appears. Install options Description LicenseKey Required. Your New Relic license key. NoIISReset Optional. Use this option to prevent the installer from initiating an IIS reset. Important If you use this option, you need to do an IIS reset manually before New Relic starts instrumenting any IIS-hosted applications. InstrumentAll Optional. By default, the .NET agent will instrument all IIS-hosted applications. Use this option to enable instrumentation of other types of .NET applications. InstallPath Optional. Use this option to choose a different installation location. The default install location is C:\\Program Files\\New Relic. Uninstalling the agent with the scriptable uninstaller: Tip You can add the Force option to the uninstall script to force an uninstall without prompting to restart IIS. Execute the following command to uninstall the .NET Framework agent: .\\uninstall.cmd Copy Scriptable installer for .NET Core Important Before installing the agent: Understand the agent requirements, including the permissions requirements. Note that admin rights in an elevated shell are required (specifically for selecting a custom log directory and performing an IISReset). Caution For security reasons, it is necessary to execute the installAgent.ps1 script as shown below, by prepending ./ to the script filename, rather than by prepending powershell to the script. If you execute the script by prepending powershell, and any of your supplied arguments (e.g. the install path or custom log path) have spaces in them, these arguments will be corrupted, which would lead to the agent being installed to a location other than the intended location, which could be unsecure. To use the scriptable installer to install the .NET agent for a .NET Core application: Ensure you have administrator rights for your Windows admin group. For more details on this, see the permissions documentation Download the .NET Core agent's scriptable installer package from the .NET agent download site . By downloading or using one of these packages, you agree to and accept the license terms. Unzip the package in the desired location. Open a command shell and navigate into the unzipped package's folder. You can install the agent either locally or globally: Local install For a simple install, with no options, use this command: ./installAgent.ps1 -destination PATH -installType global -licenseKey YOUR_LICENSE_KEY \\ [-appName \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\" -logDir \"PATH_TO_CUSTOM_LOG_LOCATION\"] Copy To install with one or more additional options, use the same command with desired options. For option descriptions, see table below. ./installAgent.ps1 -destination PATH -installType local -licenseKey YOUR_LICENSE_KEY \\ [-appName \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\" -logDir \"PATH_TO_CUSTOM_LOG_LOCATION\" -X86 -ResetIIS -Force] Copy Global install Important The global install will instrument all .NET Core processes on your system. Only choose the global install if you want all .NET Core processes monitored. For a simple install with no options, use this command: ./installAgent.ps1 -destination PATH -installType global -licenseKey YOUR_LICENSE_KEY \\ [-appName \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\" -logDir \"PATH_TO_CUSTOM_LOG_LOCATION\"] Copy To install with one or more additional options, use the same command with desired options. For option descriptions, see table below. ./installAgent.ps1 -destination PATH -installType local -licenseKey YOUR_LICENSE_KEY \\ [-appName \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\" -logDir \"PATH_TO_CUSTOM_LOG_LOCATION\" -X86 -ResetIIS -Force] Copy If your application is receiving traffic, data should appear within a few minutes. If it doesn't, see No data appears. Install options Description Destination Required. The location where the agent is installed. This can be an absolute or relative path. Wrapping quotes are required. InstallType Required. Determines whether this is a local (app-specific) or global (system-wide) install. LicenseKey Required. Your New Relic license key. AppName Optional. Sets the default application name associated with your agent installation. LogDir Optional. Sets a custom logging location for the agent. By default, the agent puts the logs directory in the install directory. X86 Optional. Installs the 32-bit version of the agent rather than the 64-bit version. New Relic does not recommend installing the 32-bit version of the agent globally. ResetIIS Optional. Performs an iisreset after the installation. Important Only use this if your .NET Core app is hosted via an IIS reverse proxy. Force Optional. Forces the installation process to overwrite a previous install or to install into an existing folder. Caution This overwrites any configuration customizations. New Relic recommends backing up your configuration file and any custom instrumentation files prior to forcing an over-install. Help Optional. Displays usage information for this script.",

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you learned of a third-party service that you can use to fetch mock cancellation data for the Total cancellations per version chart in your New Relic One application. Even though the data in this service is fake, the real value of this lesson is learning how you can use third party services to supply data to your New Relic One application. If you make a request to the mock service with cancellation data (https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations) you'll see a response rejecting your request with a message that reads \"Unauthorized\": bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations Unauthorized This is because the Nerdsletter API requires an Authorization header. More specifically, you must pass a bearer token of ABC123 to gain authorized access to its data. If you make a request to the service with the header Authorization: Bearer ABC123, you'll get a successful response with the mocked cancellation data: bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations -H 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' {\"a\": 15, \"b\": 78} In the last lesson, you used NerdGraph to store this API token in your New Relic One application's NerdStorageVault data store. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component and logged its use to your browser's console. In this lesson, you follow up that log statement with a real request to the Nerdsletter API using your authorization token. Then, you supply the data from that external resource to your Total cancellations per version chart. Step 1 of 6 Change to the third-party-services/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/third-party-services/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 6 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js, make a request to api.nerdsletter.net with your API token. Save the results to state, and use that state in render(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { cancellations: [], lastToken: null } } generateChartData(data) { const cancellationsA = data ? data.a : 0; const cancellationsB = data ? data.b : 0; return [ { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsA }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsB }, ], }, ] } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`Requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) fetch( \"https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations\", {headers: {\"Authorization\": `Bearer ${this.props.token}`}} ).then( (response) => { if (response.status == 200) { return response.json() } else if (response.status == 401) { console.error(\"Incorrect auth header\") } else { console.error(response.text()) } } ).then( (data) => { if (data) { this.setState({ cancellations: this.generateChartData(data), lastToken: this.props.token }) } } ) } } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={this.state.cancellations} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy In this code, you initialize TotalCancellations.state.cancellations with zero for the y-value in each series instead of the previously hardcoded values. This helps to more realistically represent what the chart should show if your New Relic One app hasn't successfully requested data from the Nerdsletter API. Next, you use Javascript's fetch() function to make an HTTP request to the Nerdsletter API. You then pass your token in the request's Authorization header. If the request is successful, you update the cancellation data in TotalCancellations.state so that that data is reflected in the component's render method. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/third-party-service/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. If your token in NerdStorageVault is not \"ABC123\", then your console will show an error that reads, \"Incorrect auth header\": If you set the token to \"ABC123\", then Total cancellations per version updates to show the values from the third-party service: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great job! You've come a long way from running nr1 nerdpack:create for the first time. Take a look back at your design guide to see that your application now has everything from an interface and data perspective that you planned from the beginning: You've created eight charts with varying styles and supplied them with dynamic data from multiple sources. You've learned about the New Relic One SDK and used many of its components. You've even gathered data from a third-party service and mixed it seemlessly with your New Relic data to provide a complete look at how the competing versions in your A/B test perform against each other. From here, there is only one more set of APIs in the New Relic One SDK that you've yet to get your hands on: Platform APIs. These will come in handy in improving the usability of your New Relic One application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add NrqlQuery components to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In this series, you're creating a New Relic One application, or NR1 app for short, that shows A/B test data in a variety of charts. Most of the charts need to show data that comes from a demo service you spun up at the beginning of this series. To refresh your memory on what you're building, review your design guide: In the last lesson, you supplied real data, which comes from New Relic's database, to the following charts: Newsletter subscriptions per version Version A - Page views Version B - Page views Total subscriptions per version Because you have experience querying subscription and page view data, you may feel ready to supply data to even more charts: Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions However, these charts are different than the charts you've supplied data to because they compare data from two different sources: subscription events and pageView events. In this lesson, you learn how to format data from multiple sources to exist in the same chart. Experiment with data in the Data explorer Step 1 of 6 From your New Relic homepage's top navigation menu, go to to the Data explorer: Here, you can experiment with subscription event and pageView event queries to make sure you fetch the right data in your app. Step 2 of 6 Select subscription from the Custom events menu: This queries NRDB for subscription event totals per minute over the last 30 minutes and shows that data in a chart: Step 3 of 6 Click Dimensions to see a list of the attributes associated with these subscription events: You can filter and group subscription events using these dimensions. For Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, you want to filter your subscription totals by page_version. Step 4 of 6 Click the NRQL query to navigate to the Query builder: Here, you can view and manually edit the query to fetch the data you need. Step 5 of 6 Add a WHERE clause to filter subscription totals by page_version: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Remove the TIMESERIES clause to fetch a count: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO Copy Modify the SINCE clause to see totals over the past week: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO Copy Click Run and see the data visualized in a billboard chart instead of a line chart: Step 6 of 6 Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions need a combined total of four data values: All-time subscription totals for version A All-time page view totals for version A All-time subscription totals for version B All-time page view totals for version B Experiment with the Query builder to discover the four queries which pull the right data. In the end, you'll come up with the following four queries: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'b' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = 'b' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO Copy technical detail Unlike other structured query languages, NRQL doesn't provide a mechanism for joining data across sources. This is why you have to perform two queries to get subscription event totals and pageView event totals. Until now, you've provided every chart with a single query. Here, you have to provide two queries per chart. In the remaining steps, you'll learn how to customize NrqlQuery results to merge data from multiple sources. Merge NRQL from multiple sources Step 1 of 9 Change to the customize-nrql-data/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/customize-nrql-data/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 9 In your Nerdlet's totals.js file, implement constructor() and the React lifecycle method componentDidMount() in VersionTotals: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { tableData: { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } } } componentDidMount() { NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[0].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[1].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[this.state.tableData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Here, you initialize your state in the component's constructor. The state has a single value, tableData, which holds series data and metadata for the TableChart. In componentDidMount(), you query the data that populates the data in this state. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that is called when a component is mounted in the component tree. You use this method, instead of the constructor, to query data because your logic, which requests data from New Relic, introduces side effects and sets state values, neither of which you should do in the constructor. In componentDidMount(), you use NrqlQuery in a new way. First, you specified the formatType to NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW because you're going to modify the data instead of supplying it directly to a chart Before, you used its JSX form in the render() method of a chart. Second, you called its query() method and handled the results in a then() callback, which logs them to the console. Step 3 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, create a constant called ACCOUNT_ID and pass it to VersionTotals: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/ Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 4 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/customize-nrql-data/ab-test. Step 5 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 6 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Navigate to your app in New Relic. Step 7 of 9 To view your logs, which are useful for uncovering errors in your application, turn on developer tools in your favorite browser and navigate to the Console: FireFox instructions Safari instructions Chrome instructions With your app on-screen, notice the NRQL data in the console: This console log tells you that you can find the data you're looking for, namely the subscription or pageView count, at data.raw.results[0].count. The next step is to store that count in state.tableData. Tip If something doesn't work, use these debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 8 of 9 In totals.js, store the query data in state: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { tableData: { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } } } componentDidMount() { NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[0].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[1].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[this.state.tableData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Pay close attention to the data you're accessing. The array indices are particularly important to get right. The subscription data should go to state.tableData.data[0].count because in tableData, it is the first element in the data array: data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], Copy By similar logic, page view data should go to state.tableData.data[1].count. Step 9 of 9 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID In this lesson, you learned how to use NrqlQuery.query() to fetch data from multiple sources and stitch them together into data your chart can use. Notice that there are still two charts in your NR1 application that use mock data: Total unsubscriptions per version Past tests Unfortunately, your demo application doesn't create custom New Relic events when a user unsubscribes from your newsletter or you end an A/B test. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to populate Past tests.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorage from your nerdlet, before starting this one. Throughout this course, you're building a New Relic One application that gathers telemetry data from a demo web service that's running an A/B test on a newsletter signup form. The purpose of your New Relic One application is to help you understand how design changes impact the number of high quality newsletter subscriptions your service gets. The business objective, to increase your service's high quality newsletter subscriptions, relies primarily on three key pieces of information: Number of page views per version Number of subscriptions per version Number of cancellations Cancellations are important because if one design version of your newsletter signup form results in a high number of subscriptions but also a high number of cancellations, then those subscriptions are not as valuable. In previous lessons, you gathered data for page views and subscriptions from New Relic's database (NRDB), but you still need cancellation data. Your demo application does not report cancellation data to New Relic, so you need to fetch that data from an external source. We've provided a service at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations to return fake cancellation data for the purposes of this course. If you visit this URL in your browser, you'll see a brief message: \"Unauthorized\". This is because we created this service with a requirement that whoever requests its data must pass an Authorization header with the bearer token ABC123. So before you can request cancellation data from api.nerdsletter.net, you need to implement a few new behaviors in your application: Provide a mechanism for inputting an authorization token Persist the authorization token in a secure data store To input your authorization token, you'll use a Modal with a TextField. The secure data store you'll use is called NerdStorageVault. It's different from NerdStorage, which you used in the last lesson, because it only supports user storage and encrypts its data. Store your API token Step 1 of 3 Change to the add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 3 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, initialize state in AbTestNerdletNerdlet with a null token default: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Your Nerdlet uses this token state to manage the authorization token you'll later pass to the third-party service. However, a component's state is not a long-term solution for data management. For that, you need NerdStorageVault. Step 3 of 3 Implement a method, called storeToken(), which mutates NerdStorageVault data, and bind that method to the AbTestNerdletNerdlet instance: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy When you call storeToken() with a new token value, your Nerdlet uses NerdGraph APIs to mutate NerdStorageVault data for the api_token key. If the request to NerdGraph is successful, storeToken() updates state.token so that the new token is locally accessible. Unlike NerdStorage, which has query and mutation components for your convenience, NerdStorageVault has no components in the SDK. Instead, you have to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to interact with it Important It's important to remember that NerdStorageVault is limited to the user scope. Any other users of your New Relic One application will have their own NerdStorageVault data. This means that even other users on your account will need to enter their token separately. Query your API token Step 1 of 2 First, create methods and state to show and hide your API token prompt: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy state.hideTokenPrompt determines whether or not the prompt is visible. Now, you need a mechanism for revealing the prompt, which is hidden by default. Step 2 of 2 Query NerdStorageVault for your api_token: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, in componentDidMount(), you've queried NerdGraph for your api_token data. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that's called when your component is mounted in the component tree. This means that early in it's setup process, your application will request your api_token. If the NerdGraph query responds successfully with your token from NerdStorageVault, it sets the token in state. Otherwise, it shows the prompt so that you can enter a token. This is great for storing an initial token, but what if you enter the wrong token or the API changes? You need a way reveal the prompt on-demand. Next, you'll create the actual token prompt and a button to manually invoke the prompt. Create your token prompt Step 1 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named token-prompt.js: bash Copy $ touch token-prompt.js Step 2 of 9 In this new file, create a button that allows you to enter a new token on demand: import React from 'react'; import { Button } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenButton receives showPrompt() in its props and calls that method when its Button is clicked. Step 3 of 9 Create a token prompt using a Modal with a TextField: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenPrompt renders a Modal with a TextField, a Button, and an explanatory prompt. You use the Modal to enter your API token. It also provides basic error handling if you try to submit the form with no token value. It's important to distinguish the token in AbTestNerdletNerdlet.state and the token in ApiTokenPrompt.state. The token in your Nerdlet's state is the current token that your Nerdlet knows about. It's this token that matches what's in NerdStorageVault. The token in ApiTokenPrompt.state is a fluid value that changes as you update the text in the TextField. When you press Submit in the modal, ApiTokenPrompt submits its token to your Nerdlet's storeToken() method. Then, storeToken() mutates NerdStorageVault with the new token. You also implemented a few methods to improve the user experience: keyPress() submits the token when the RETURN key is pressed showTokenError() and hideTokenError() remind the user that they must enter a token before submitting the form Step 4 of 9 Export your components, so you can use them in your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } export { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import ApiTokenButton and ApiTokenPrompt and add them to render(): import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; import { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } from './token-prompt'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you visit your application for the first time, the prompt is automatically revealed. Enter \"ABC123\" in the TextField, as that's the token that the third-party service expects. Once you submit your token and your Nerdlet hides the prompt, click Update API token at the bottom of your New Relic One application to reveal it again: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Pass your API token to TotalCancellations Step 1 of 3 In index.js, pass the API token to TotalCancellations so you're prepared to make a request to the third-party service: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests';

this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `;

} } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <TotalCancellations token={this.state.token} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 2 of 3 In total-cancellations.js, log the token to your browser console: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { lastToken: null } } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) this.setState({lastToken: this.props.token}) } } render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy Here, you've implemented another React lifecycle method, called componentDidUpdate(). Now, every time your Nerdlet's state.token changes, TotalCancellations gets a new token prop, which triggers componentDidUpdate(). In componentDidUpdate(), you check that the incoming token is not the same as the last token it knew about, which is stored in local state. If the incoming token is different, you log a message with the new token and update state.lastToken. This logic prepares your code for a future change to use your API token in a request to a third-party service. Step 3 of 3 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see the log from TotalCancellations in your browser's console: If you change your token, you'll see another log from TotalCancellations with your updated token. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now you know how to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to manage data in NerdStorageVault! Remember, use NerdStorage for your New Relic One application's non-sensitive data and NerdStorageVault for the sensitive stuff like tokens, passwords, and other secrets. As a bonus, you created a way to manage your token in NerdStorageVault from the user interface. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component for later use. Whether it's been with NrqlQuery, AccountStorageQuery, AccountStorageMutation, NerdGraphQuery, or NerdGraphMutation, you've learned several ways to interact with New Relic data in your New Relic One application. But New Relic One applications aren't just another way to show New Relic data. The purpose of New Relic One applications is to show you how your software is helping you meet your business objectives. Sometimes, New Relic data is all you need to make that happen, but other times you need to look beyond New Relic for data to fill in the gaps.

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the New Relic One catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in the catalog Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the New Relic One app catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Apps: From here, you can see your application under New Relic One catalog: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots... ✔ Screenshots uploaded ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release! Includes: - A variety of charts for understanding the test r... whatsNew.version: 1.0.0 All the information from catalog shows here. Step 3 of 3 View your app in the catalog: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public New Relic One catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Subscribe to your New Relic One application.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you used PlatformStateContext from the New Relic One SDK to look up the time range that the user selected from the app's time picker. Now, you'll learn about another component that interacts with the New Relic platform: navigation. The navigation component lets you open entities, navigate to entities, and build Location objects for entities from your Nerdlet. You can also use navigation for other Nerdlets and launchers. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-navigation/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In newsletter-signups.js, create a new method, called NewsletterSignups.openApmEntity(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. This method uses navigation.openStackedEntity() to display your demo application's APM entity in a stacked view. Notice openApmEntity() requires your ENTITY_GUID. You need to locate that ID and store it in a constant. Step 3 of 10 Navigate to APM: See metadata for your Newsletter service: Copy the entity's GUID: Create an ENTITY_GUID constant: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and the entity GUID you just copied, respectively. Now, openApmEntity() knows what entity to show. Next, you need to create a button to invoke this method. Step 4 of 10 Create a button to show your APM entity: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you've created a button and configured it to call openApmEntity() when it's clicked. Step 5 of 10 Import Stack and StackItem: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. You'll use Stack and StackItem to lay out the button on the far right side of the same row that the HeadingText is on. Step 6 of 10 Lay out the Stack: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <Stack fullWidth> <StackItem grow={true}> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> </StackItem> <StackItem> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> </StackItem> </Stack> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you used a full-width Stack to set up the layout for the row. To make the HeadingText fill the entire row except the width of the button, you used the StackItem.grow prop. Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. Click App performance: Now you see the stacked entity: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively Congratulations! You're finished writing all the code you'll write for your New Relic One A/B test application. Now, you have an application reporting New Relic data from your demo service that is running an A/B test. You've created several charts, buttons, and other UI elements. And you've organized your components into a readable and usable view. On top of the visuals, you've supplied data to your charts from multiple data sources in and outside of New Relic. You've created some backend functionality which utilizes your New Relic One application's own data store. You've also utilized the platform APIs for interacting with platform UI and showing a stacked entity view. You've really accomplished a lot throughout this course, so far. There are only a few things left to do! First, is to learn how to publish and subscribe to your New Relic One application so that it can run on our platform instead of your own local server. Second, is to learn how to deal with some common issues you might see in New Relic One application development.

      "info": "Build a \"Hello, World!\" app and publish it to New Relic One",
      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in the New Relic One Catalog, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add pie charts, before starting this one. In each hands-on lesson in this course, you have been adding something new to your A/B test application. You’ve spun up a new launcher and added multiple chart components to your Nerdlet. In this lesson, you’ll create two new TableChart components that display information about each version of your website, such as the ratio of customers who subscribe to those who unsubscribe. Review your design guide to understand where these tables will fit into your application: In this design guide, the TableChart components come after the pie charts you created in the last lesson. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-tables/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-tables/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named totals.js: bash Copy $ touch totals.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a component called VersionTotals to hold your first TableChart and some mock data: import React from 'react'; import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { const versionATotals = { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } return <TableChart data={[versionATotals]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy TableChart is different from PieChart and LineChart in three big ways. First of all, there are no color or viz metadata attributes in its series. TableChart has a standard visualization, so it ignores things like color, which don't apply. Second, the TableChart series have columns metadata attributes. columns determines the names of the columns on the table. Finally, TableChart series data use neither x nor y values. Instead, they use keys that match the table column and values that determine what goes into the row. Notice that VersionTotals takes a version prop and supplies it to the chart metadata's id and name fields. This allows you to use this same component to create a table for version A and B and eliminate duplicate code. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-tables/ab-test. Step 6 of 8 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 7 of 8 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the TableChart components displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Extra credit There is one more table in the design guide that records past tests. The columns for this table are: End Date: The end date for the test Version A Description: A description for version A Version B Description: A description for version B Winner: The version selected as the final design Try to build this table in your application with these column names and some fake data, without looking at a code sample. This practice will reinforce what you've learned in this lesson. If you need help, review the add-a-chart-group directory of the coursework repository, which corresponds to the next lesson in this course. This has the code for the PastTests component. Each chart you’ll add to your application throughout this course is unique in its type or in the data it presents. So far, you’ve created tables, pie charts, and a line chart, and they all function independently of one another. In the next lesson, you’ll create a couple more line charts, but this time they’ll function together. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. When you're ready, continue on to the next lesson: Add a chart group.",

Observe your platform New Relic One gives you full access to the data from all the entities in your stack. Go to the New Relic Explorer at one.newrelic.com to see a full list of entities, identify overall behaviors, filter them to locate sources of performance issues, or plan improvements for your system. Search accounts and entities Access Quick find clicking the button at the top right corner of the New Relic One UI. Some details about your search: You can search across all your New Relic accounts with cross-account access. Entities that cease to exist are available in search for eight days. If your organization has multiple accounts, use the account picker at the top left corner to select accounts. Use chart and query features You can add most charts to a new or existing dashboard. Here are some query and chart features available across all or most of the platform: If you want to... Do this... Start querying your data Mouse over Browse data and select metrics, events, logs, or traces for a direct access to any of those types of data. Also, at the top of any UI page, select Query your data to access the data explorer and query builder. View a chart's query For some charts, you can view the NRQL query used to generate that chart. This can help you understand a chart better or use it as the basis for a new query. Choose time range Drag across a section of a chart to zoom in on that time range. Or, use the time picker in the top right corner of the UI to select pre-set time ranges or set a custom one. View chart details Mouse over a chart to see a pop-up with more detail. For some charts, selecting a point on the chart will take you to a UI page with more information about that metric. Hide or return chart elements To hide or unhide a displayed chart element, select that element's name below the chart. The chart display will adjust to reflect the absence or presence of that element. Share with teammates Here are some options for sharing New Relic UI pages and visualizations. If you want to... Do this... Share UI pages and dashboards To share an entire New Relic UI page, click Share near the top of the UI to copy the URL. Share charts If New Relic charts are built with NRQL queries, they have a menu that exposes various options, including sharing options like Get as image and Get chart link. Some notes about sharing: The person you share with may not have access to view the data from that account. To solve that, someone on your team with New Relic user management abilities must add that person to the account. If someone can't access a custom dashboard, it may be that it is set to private. Read more about dashboard permissions. Some sharing options have associated time ranges, which may impact later viewings of it. For example, if you use a chart's Get chart link option and that chart is set to 'Last 30 minutes', when viewed it will show the last 30 minutes, not the time range displayed when it was shared. To share a specific time range, you must select that time range in the UI. Smooth navigation: Customize your bar and access the shortcuts Select the edit icon at the right end of the navigation bar to customize your view. Home, Explorer, Browse data, Dashboards, and Alerts & AI are fixed, but you can favorite up to six more elements to display on the bar as well. The rest will go on the More group. Navigation shortcuts are a faster way to find entities and apps that are relevant to you. Mouse over any menu item for quick access to your favorite entities, those you recently visited, or just to search without having to navigate to a specific section. If you click on an entity, you can choose to open it in the same browser tab or in a new one.

      "body": "Mobile app crashes can result in users submitting negative reviews, which can affect your organization's reputation. Crashes can also result in users deleting your app altogether, which affects your organization's profitability. With the Crash analysis UI, you can identify and deal with one of the largest bottlenecks in the development lifecycle: the time it takes to resolve unanticipated exceptions. Use crash analysis features When your development team receives an emailed crash notification, they can select the email link to review detailed information about the crash in our user interface, or analyze chart data directly through a query. The individual Crash details page also includes tracking tools for your team to follow the issue from reporting to resolution. Our crash analysis feature helps developers to: Slice and dice your crash and network data (using groups and filters) to analyze trends leading to the crash. Understand a particular user's experience by using a custom attribute. Pinpoint when most crashes occur; for example, by filtering by Last Interaction, or by viewing the interaction trail in the Crash report page. Align issues with common characteristics in networks or devices. Examine specific problems in a crash report that may be buried in thread breakdown data, trace details, or the trail of user interactions in the crashed session. Quickly see trends from the Crash profiles tab. View the crash list To view the filterable Crash list in the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Crash analysis. OR To view the filterable Crash analysis page directly from the mobile app's Overview page, select the Crash occurrences chart's title. Use any of our standard page functions to drill down into detailed information; for example, zoom into any area of a chart. Use the crash analysis workflow To get the most out of mobile monitoring's Crash analysis UI, use this basic workflow. Start with the Crash rate percentage and Crash-free users percentage charts to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with crash time frames, or uneventful periods within the selected time period. Use the groups and filters to examine attributes (for crashes, devices, locations, or other custom attributes) in more detail. Use the Top 5 occurrences chart to identify patterns for the type of occurrence you selected from the groups and filters. Also correlate any general patterns for the selected type of occurrence to crash percentages that occurred during this time period. Optional: Query or share the chart data. Look for patterns in the Crash location table information, including location, exception type, date and number of occurrences, version, and number of users affected by the crash. Select a crash report from the table to view its interaction trail, its event trail, thread details for individual occurrences, attributes, and more. If necessary, resymbolicate or export the crash details to Xcode so you can debug your source code more easily. When finished, mark the crash occurrences as Resolved. Resolved crashes include a banner identifying who resolved the crash and when. Based on mobile monitoring's data retention policies, you can filter by resolved crashes when you need to track back to historical information. Crash percentages charts: See patterns immediately. Start with the Crash rate percentage and Crash-free users percentage charts to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with crashes in general. For example: Are there any spikes near a recent version release? Is there a time period when the percentage of users has been affected significantly by the crash? (If the Crash-free users percentage chart is empty, there were no user sessions during the selected time period.) Groups and filters: Slice and dice the crash data. You can select a group, and then filter to specific data, including: Group the crash list by type of crash, device, location, or other custom attributes. Show open crashes, resolved crashes, or all crashes. Use the time picker to adjust the currently selected time period. Filter by a specific Version or by one or more attribute Filter, such as Last Interaction, App Build, or any of the longer list of standard and custom attributes). The selected filters appear at the top of the UI page. Top five occurrences: Analyze specific characteristics. Use the Top 5 occurrences chart to identify what types of crashes and how many occurred during the selected time period. This chart shows the top five crash occurrences by the group and filters you select. For example, you can group by email address (if instrumented as a custom attribute), then filter down to a specific email to examine that user's experience. To filter or group by other attributes, use the search window, or select any of the available filters. For example, filter by type of crash, device, a specific location, or any custom attributes. To look for other historical patterns, change the selected time period. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Crash analysis: Here is an example of the Top 5 occurrences chart filtered by the Crash locations group. Select any groups or filters to analyze your crash data any way you want. Queries and image links: Query crash data and share charts with others. Mobile monitoring's Crash analysis charts use default attributes for mobile events, along with any custom attributes you have added to this event type. To view or share the data, click the ellipsis icon. Add to dashboard link: View the chart, and copy it to a new or existing dashboard. View query link: View the NRQL query used to calculate the chart data. Get as image link: Select this option to get a public URL of the chart, then share it using any media. Crash reports: Dive into the interaction trail, thread breakdown, and more. Supplementing the charts, the Crash report table lists crash types by location, and links them to relevant crash report details. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this crash type or exception occurred within the selected time period? What is the most recent exception message? Does a specific app version have a higher (or lower) number of users affected? When did the exception first and last occur? one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions > Crash analysis: Sort on any column to analyze patterns in the Crash reports table, then select any report to review crash details. Sometimes it may be more useful to examine crash report data from lowest to highest. For example: Which exception has the fewest number of occurrences? When did a particular exception start (Earliest occurrence)? You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of exceptions that matter the most to you and your teams. Crash profiles: Quickly see key differences between crashed and crash-free accounts. Crash profiles provide quick, clear insight into your mobile crash data by surfacing any anomalies in your mobile application’s performance. Unexpected differences between attributes and behaviors are highlighted, illuminating key differences between crashed and crash-free accounts. You can quickly pinpoint key issues through drill-downs and filters for a fast, streamlined troubleshooting experience. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Exceptions> Crash analysis > Crash profiles: Compare crashed and crash-free sessions. Crash event trail: See all the events leading up to a crash. The mobile monitoring crash event trail shows you the events leading up to a crash of a mobile app. These can be events monitored by default, or custom events you've created. For more information, see Crash event trail. Examine crash report details: Export to Xcode or resymbolicate your source code. From the Crash report table, you can drill down into a specific Crash report. From here you can: Examine the interaction trail from session start through the crash event. Explore the related thread breakdown. Select Export crash details so you can examine source code using Xcode. Resymbolicate the crash report for easier debugging. File a ticket, and resolve the crash. one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Crashes > Crash report: This is an example of an interaction trail that includes the option to resymbolicate the crash occurrence. To analyze and debug your source code using Xcode, select Export crash details. Configure crash report email settings To learn how to configure email settings, see Email settings.",

      "body": "With the Errors UI in New Relic One, you can see the line of code that's causing a bad experience for your users, and get enough data to reproduce the issue so you can fix it. When you do, you’ll be able to confirm your fix is working in production. Use Errors in New Relic One to: Group and filter events to triage important errors. Get alert notifications about errors. Review stack traces, logs, and other details. Share the error information with charts and dashboards. Report new errors using instrumentation, prevent certain errors from being reported, and filter out noisy errors using expected errors. View the APM Errors page Important As of October 1, 2021, the APM Errors (classic) UI will be discontinued in favor of the New Relic One APM Errors UI. For more details, see our Explorers Hub post. To view the Errors page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app), then click the Error rate table's title on your selected app's Summary page. OR Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors. APM Errors UI: The Error rate chart always shows the rate for all errors, even if a filter is applied. To drill down further, use grouping and filter options for the Top 5 by count chart and Error traces table. Use the Instance dropdown to focus on a specific instance. Use the Errors workflow to identify problems Use this basic workflow to get the most out of the information you see from the Errors page. Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. Correlate any general patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. Use the groups and filters to examine the error events and attributes in more detail, and look for patterns with error messages, transaction names, or other groupings. Explore and share Error trace table information, including specific stack trace details, logs, and attributes (host, URL, user, custom attributes, etc.) Also review the Error profiles page to guide your investigation into which attribute values might be correlated to the cause of errors, by comparing the frequency of those values between transactions where the error did and didn't occur (only in the old UI). Error rate chart: See patterns immediately Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. For example, are there any spikes near a recent deployment? You may want to change the selected time period to look for other historical patterns. This chart always shows the overall error rate and count for the selected time period, even when you filter the rest of the page. If you want to focus your investigation on a particular type of error, use the Top 5 errors chart or the Error traces table. Top five errors: Correlate to alerts or find significant groupings Use the Top 5 errors chart to identify what error types and how many of those errors occurred during the same time period as the Error rate chart. For example: Is the error spike related to a specific exception class or transaction? Do the top errors point to a new host/container that recently got moved into production? Are the top error messages repeatedly about failed connections by hosts that you know are in a specific region of your organization? Have the chart backgrounds changed color to indicate an alert condition? (Light pink indicates the alert condition's Warning threshold, and dark pink indicates the Critical threshold.) If you want to... Do this... Change the \"top 5\" selection By default, Top 5 errors chart shows the top five errors by error class and transaction name. To group by other attributes, such as error message, host, or custom attribute, use the search bar. Explore or share error trend data The Top 5 errors chart uses error events, which include rich attribute data b default, along with any custom attributes you have added to the error event type. To examine this data in more detail, or to share it with others, select the View query or Add to dashboard links that appear when you click the chart's ... menu. Error traces: Find the line of code and data needed to reproduce the issue The Error traces table groups errors by the attributes you've selected, and links them to relevant detailed error traces. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this transaction/class (or custom grouping) occurred within the selected time period? What is the most recent error message? When did this error first and last occur? Sometimes it may be useful to sort error trace data other than from the most to fewest occurrences. You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of errors that matter the most to you and your teams. For example: Which error has the fewest occurrences (sort on Errors column)? When did a particular error stop (sort on Last occurred)? Once you find the group of errors you want to fix, click a row in the Error traces table to drill down into the stack traces and attribute data that help pinpoint the cause. Expected errors Reduce noisy errors by marking them as “expected errors”. Such errors won't affect reported error rate or Apdex metrics. See Manage errors for more details. Expected errors aren't shown by default on the Errors page. You can show them by turning on the Show N expected errors switch below the Group by bar. Errors outside transactions Using the New Relic agent API, you can record custom errors at any point in the execution of your code. Sometimes, such custom errors will occur when a transaction is not executing, such as in high-volume aynchronous code that doesn't handle an HTTP transaction. Errors outside transactions are shown by default on the Errors page, but you can hide them by turning off the Show N errors outside transactions switch below the Group by bar. Select the time period for error data Use the time picker to examine details of error events over the past week. The error events view is available for up to a seven-day window of data collected over the last eight days. You may notice slight differences in count if your time window is set to ending now. This occurs because the counts for the list and table may be requested at slightly different times as the page auto-refreshes.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add pie charts, before starting this one. In each hands-on lesson in this course, you have been adding something new to your A/B test application. You’ve spun up a new launcher and added multiple chart components to your Nerdlet. In this lesson, you’ll create two new TableChart components that display information about each version of your website, such as the ratio of customers who subscribe to those who unsubscribe. Review your design guide to understand where these tables will fit into your application: In this design guide, the TableChart components come after the pie charts you created in the last lesson. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-tables/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-tables/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named totals.js: bash Copy $ touch totals.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a component called VersionTotals to hold your first TableChart and some mock data: import React from 'react'; import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { const versionATotals = { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } return <TableChart data={[versionATotals]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy TableChart is different from PieChart and LineChart in three big ways. First of all, there are no color or viz metadata attributes in its series. TableChart has a standard visualization, so it ignores things like color, which don't apply. Second, the TableChart series have columns metadata attributes. columns determines the names of the columns on the table. Finally, TableChart series data use neither x nor y values. Instead, they use keys that match the table column and values that determine what goes into the row. Notice that VersionTotals takes a version prop and supplies it to the chart metadata's id and name fields. This allows you to use this same component to create a table for version A and B and eliminate duplicate code. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-tables/ab-test. Step 6 of 8 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 7 of 8 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the TableChart components displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Extra credit There is one more table in the design guide that records past tests. The columns for this table are: End Date: The end date for the test Version A Description: A description for version A Version B Description: A description for version B Winner: The version selected as the final design Try to build this table in your application with these column names and some fake data, without looking at a code sample. This practice will reinforce what you've learned in this lesson. If you need help, review the add-a-chart-group directory of the coursework repository, which corresponds to the next lesson in this course. This has the code for the PastTests component. Each chart you’ll add to your application throughout this course is unique in its type or in the data it presents. So far, you’ve created tables, pie charts, and a line chart, and they all function independently of one another. In the next lesson, you’ll create a couple more line charts, but this time they’ll function together. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. When you're ready, continue on to the next lesson: Add a chart group.",

In this course, you’re building an A/B test application for the New Relic platform. Previously, you learned about the New Relic One SDK and its component library. Now, It’s time for you to start building your application focusing first on chart components. Before you write any code, consult your design guide to remember what the application will look like when you finish: There are several charts you need to create, which may seem overwhelming at first, but take it one step at a time. The topmost chart, and the first you’ll create, is a line chart that shows the number of users who sign up for your newsletter and what version of your website they were shown.

The color metadata attribute takes any CSS-acceptable color format. Setting viz: 'main' means that you want to render the LineChart series as a line, the component's default display style. For the data prop in the LineChart component, you passed the two series in an array so that both are represented together. Finally, you used the chart’s fullWidth prop to stretch the chart’s width to fill the view. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and replace the default heading in your Nerdlet's render() method with your new component: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-your-first-chart/ab-test. Step 6 of 8 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 7 of 8 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the LineChart displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. In seven steps, you’ve breathed life into your New Relic One application. Instead of a bland “Hello world” message, your application now shows a colorful line chart with two mocked data series. These data series represent server-side traffic for each of the competing designs in your demo website. In the next lesson, you’ll build on this foundation by creating another chart type.

Change the appearance of your chart When you run your query in advanced (NRQL) mode or view your chart while using basic mode to specify data, the query builder analyzes your data and applies a chart type that fits your data. For some queries, you'll have several options of chart types to choose from. To change chart type, use the Chart type menu to the right of the current chart. Each type in the list has a tooltip with information about using that type. Example of the chart type menu, showing a tooltip. Customize your charts While we try our best to optimize how we display your data, sometimes you may have other needs. To this end, you can customize charts to display information at your convenience. Tip Customizations are available depending on the chart type. Format date and time Tip For table and billboard charts. Customize the date and time format for tables and billboards: for each type of data, you can select if you want to leave it as it is, or modify the format as Numeric or Date. If data is a timestamp, you can choose how to represent the date and time: For numbers, select if you want us to auto-format them, or chose the number of decimals you want to see. Customize the Y axis Tip For line and area charts. On line charts and area charts you can adjust the Y axis to display the data within certain values by setting a minimum and maximum value for the axis. If no customization option is selected, dashboards automatically displays the full Y axis from 0 to the top value plus a margin. Enable or disable the legend Tip For line and area charts, and histograms. For line charts, area charts, and histograms, you can disable or enable the legend. Remove the other groups facet Tip For bar and pie charts, and tables. When faceting on bar charts, pie charts, or tables, and if the number of faceting on queries is larger than 2,000, the Other groups facet aggregates the rest of facets. With this customization you can select whether to see Other groups, or remove it. More chart-specific features For more chart type-specific features, see Chart types. Chart share and view options Most charts have various options, including a chart-embed option, getting a chart as an image, and adding a chart to a dashboard.

      "body": "When building a query using the query builder, there are a variety of types of visualizations for presenting your data in the optimal format. This table contains all chart types. Whether a chart type is available for your query will be dependent on: The type of query (some query results don't match some chart types) The query mode (basic or advanced) Area chart An area chart shows a time series for a single attribute. The area chart type shows a time series for a single attribute. To enable an area chart, add a FACET to your query. Important You can add only one facet in basic mode. In advanced mode, you can use facet to add up to five attributes, separated by commas. Use the TIMESERIES function when you use a FACET in an NRQL query. Use an area chart when you want to View the measurement of a single attribute over a period of time that you specify. Avoid an area chart when you want to View a chart that contains more than a single attribute. The line chart type is a good option; you can view multiple attributes over a time range that you specify. The bar chart type gives you a comparison view between the attributes; it uses a total of each attribute for the time range you choose. Bar chart The bar chart shows comparisons among the categories returned in the query results. The bar chart compares a related set of values. To enable a bar chart, add a FACET clause to the query. Important You can add only one facet in basic mode. You can use FACET with up to 5 different attributes, separated by commas. Use a bar chart when you want to Create a chart that reports the total count of the data for a category over the specified time range. With the bar chart format, you can easily see the differences between each category. Avoid a bar chart when you want to Include measurements over a period of time. This chart type is not available when using a TIMESERIES clause. The line chart type is a good option for this visualization. Billboard The billboard chart type presents results as a single, highly-visible value. It's an option when your query returns a single number, such as from this query: SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView since 1 day ago Copy A billboard chart is useful for single-stat queries like the Apdex function. Use billboards to monitor values at a glance. Billboards can also be used to compare a single value across states. For instance, use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the same attribute across two different time frames. The billboard chart displays a single value in a large, easy to read font. To enable the data for a billboard chart, search for a single value. You can view multiple values by adding a facet from the dropdown. You can set Warning and Critical thresholds on billboards, which will highlight a chart in yellow or red. The threshold fields are on the right side of the chart edit pane, highlighted in yellow and red respectively. If you want to highlight a chart when a value falls below a given value rather than above it, set the Warning threshold higher than the Critical threshold. Tip Threshold fields will only be available for dashboards that present a single value. For instance, the use of a COMPARE WITH clause will disable the threshold settings in the edit pane. Use a billboard chart when you want to Monitor values, including thresholds for Critical and Warning states, in a large, easy-to-read font. Avoid a billboard chart type when You want to view data over a period of time. The line chart type is a better option for viewing data by time. Bullet chart Use the bullet chart type to represent progress to a target or goal, called the limit. To use this chart type, run a query that returns a single number, such as: SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The bullet chart displays a value compared against a limit. Bullet defaults to a limit that is twice the resulting query value. To adjust the limit, use the Limit field to enter another number. The bullet will adjust accordingly. Tip The bullet chart type can only be used for charts that present a single value. For example, a query using COMPARE WITH will not list bullet as an option. Use a bullet chart when you want to View a chart uses a large, easy-to-read font that helps you view the value quickly. Avoid a bullet chart when you want to View data that has more than a single value. Bar and line chart types may be better choices in this instance. Funnel Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data types that make up the steps toward a specified goal. A funnel allows you to ask, “Of the people that did (A), how many also did (B), and of the people that did (A) and (B), how many also completed (C)?” Sample funnel chart for a shopping site. In this example, you want to determine that of all the visitors that viewed the landing page, how many of them: Browsed the products. Then added one or more products to a shopping cart. And finally, purchased the item(s) in the shopping cart. Unlike other queries, you must use a SELECT funnel() statement in your query; the funnel chart type is not selectable from any other type of query. Additionally, the funnel chart type is only available for queries with eight steps or fewer. A funnel query that includes more than eight steps will only return the results as JSON. SELECT funnel(session, WHERE pageUrl like '%/index.html' AS 'Landing', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/browse/phones' AS 'Browse ', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/shoppingcart' AS 'Cart', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/checkout' AS 'Purchased') FROM PageView where appName = 'WebPortal' AND duration < 1 SINCE 1 week ago Copy Use a funnel when you want to You want to visually evaluate the paths that visitors take after they hit a page that you designate as a landing page. Avoid a funnel when you want to You only want counts for the attributes in the WHERE clause. You will not be able to choose funnel unless you use SELECT funnel in your query. Heat map The heat map displays data in a tabular format using color gradations to show frequency in specific time buckets. The heat map is a faceted distribution of values where color density represents the values displayed. To enable a heat map, use the Histogram() function with a numeric attribute and use FACET to add up to five attributes, separated by commas. See Histograms: View data distribution for more detailed information about histogram-based charts. Use a heat map when you want to View tabular data for multiple attributes over a period of time, with gradated colors instead of numerals. Avoid a heat map when you want to View the exact data for multiple attributes over a period of time. A line or bar chart may be an option. Histogram A histogram charts frequency across a series of value ranges. Use histograms to show the distribution of data across time buckets. See Histograms: View data distribution for more detailed information about histogram-based charts. Use a histogram when you want to Chart frequency of data over a series of values. Avoid a histogram when you want to View the same data as heat map or to view the data without the time buckets. JSON Use the returned JSON to review the raw data returned and to help develop integrations with New Relic. To implement integrations, use remote queries to return raw JSON as a service. To use this, select the Share menu and click Copy JSON. Example NRQL query: SELECT uniqueCount(name) FROM Transaction WHERE httpResponseCode = '200' TIMESERIES FACET appName LIMIT 10 SINCE 24 hours ago Copy Example JSON response: { \"metadata\": { \"contents\": { \"messages\": [], \"timeSeries\": { \"messages\": [], \"contents\": [ { \"function\": \"uniquecount\", \"attribute\": \"name\", \"simple\": true } ] }, \"bucketSizeMillis\": 1800000 }, \"eventTypes\": [ \"Transaction\" ], \"eventType\": \"Transaction\", \"openEnded\": true, \"messages\": [], \"beginTimeMillis\": 1556226069396, \"endTimeMillis\": 1556312469396, \"beginTime\": \"2019-04-25T21:01:09Z\", \"endTime\": \"2019-04-26T21:01:09Z\", \"guid\": \"5238a2c6-328d-a5ff-9185-7f3f04c42d1e\", \"routerGuid\": \"1aea2ec5-0be8-3a60-7554-851e1b016eb0\", \"rawSince\": \"24 HOURS AGO\", \"rawUntil\": \"NOW\", \"rawCompareWith\": \"\", \"facet\": \"appName\", \"offset\": 0, \"limit\": 10 }, \"facets\": [ { \"name\": \"RPM Combined Production\", \"beginTimeSeconds\": 0, \"endTimeSeconds\": 0, \"timeSeries\": [ { \"results\": [ { \"uniqueCount\": 415 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 1556226069, \"endTimeSeconds\": 1556227869, \"inspectedCount\": 4589471 }, [ { \"uniqueCount\": 1714 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 1556310669, \"endTimeSeconds\": 1556312469, \"inspectedCount\": 53341469 } ], \"total\": { \"results\": [ { \"uniqueCount\": 2651 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 0, \"endTimeSeconds\": 0, \"inspectedCount\": 5053841114 } }, \"performanceStats\": { \"inspectedCount\": 6088068932, \"responseTime\": 8077 } } ... Copy Line A line chart is useful for spotting trends over time. The line chart plots a timeseries for an attribute. When working in basic query mode, select a single attribute you can plot over time. When using NRQL, SELECT one or more attributes you can plot over time and then use the TIMESERIES function. Use a line chart when you want to Create a chart that lets you easily view trends over a specified time frame. Avoid a line chart when you want to View your data using one or more attributes and see the values associated with each attribute. A bar or table chart is an option. Pie chart A pie chart is the graphic representation of the table. It appears as an option for some functions when the FACET clause is used. To use this chart type, run a query that returns one value for each of a set of attributes. The pie chart maps a set of values as a portion of a whole. To enable pie chart, add a FACET from the dropdown. You can add only one FACET in basic query mode. If you're using NRQL, you can use FACET to add up to 5 attributes, separated by commas, and also include the TIMESERIES function. Pie charts are unavailable for the following aggregator functions: average, apdex, min, max, percentage, and percentile. For uniqueCount, percentages may add up to more than 100%. Use a pie chart when you want to Create a chart that that graphically presents a set of values as they relate to a whole. A pie chart is effective for displaying values for a time period, for example. Avoid a pie chart when you want to Present data that does not use values as they related to a whole, such as with line charts. Pie chart percentage problem When using a pie chart with the uniqueCount aggregator function, the percentages can add up to more than 100%. This is because the attributes being uniquely counted may be present in multiple facets. For example, in the query SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView FACET appName, a single unique user may use multiple apps. Each of these users are included in the unique value for each of the appropriate facets (apps), but the total number of unique users won't change. To solve this, use a bar chart or table to provide a more accurate visualization of uniqueCount data. Table A table is the standard view for a set of values related to a specific attribute (for example, the count of all page views by user agent name). By default, all tables are sortable by any one column. If you are using the FACET clause, the results will normally be returned as a table. Other features of tables: You can use a table as a shortcut to other dashboards. If a table is faceted by attribute, selecting an entry takes you to an existing dashboard filtered by that attribute. You can export a table chart to a CSV file. Details on this functionality: If a filter is applied to a dashboard, the download will only include the subset of data based on the filter. If a specific fixed time range is selected, the CSV includes the data for that time period. If you query with multiple attributes, the export includes columns for all FACETs in the query. For charts with a time range dependent on the present moment (for example, since 30 minutes ago), the data in the CSV is generated from the present moment, not from when the chart was initially generated. The table chart type, with its tabular format, works well for dashboards, as well as sharing the data for use in reports, for example. Use a table when you want to Create a text-compatible table consisting of your data. This table can be shared and used in reports or imported into spreadsheets, for example. Avoid a table when you want to View your data in a graphical format.",

Organizing charts is one way to clarify the information you're trying to convey to your users. Headings are another. Since you have several charts on the same page, use headings to describe the information they show. To remember what data each chart presents, consult your design guide: The design guide details what data each chart shows. Use those details to craft useful headings for your charts. Step 1 of 6 Change to the add-chart-headings/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-chart-headings/ab-test Step 2 of 6 In newsletter-signups.js, page-views.js, past-tests.js, total-cancellations.js, total-subscriptions.js, and totals.js, import HeadingText and add a descriptive heading above the chart in each of your custom components: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } const versionBSignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-b-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 20 }, { x: 10, y: 5 }, { x: 20, y: 25 }, { x: 30, y: 45 }, { x: 40, y: 50 }, { x: 50, y: 35 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionASignups, versionBSignups]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [ { \"endDate\": \"12-15-2020\", \"versionADescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was green.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was blue.\", \"winner\": \"A\" }, { \"endDate\": \"09-06-2019\", \"versionADescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a carousel.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a grid.\", \"winner\": \"B\" } ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { const versionATotals = { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[versionATotals]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Notice the new <div> tag in each render(), which allows you to return multiple elements at once. Also, remember that we provided you a CSS stylesheet that styles the chartHeader class. You can look at nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss to see more. You don't need to modify your Nerdlet's render() method in index.js because your components encapsulate the new code. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see that your charts have descriptive headings. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Well done! You've created all the charts that are laid out in your design guide. You’ve also organized them into a neat grid and added headings so that the charts are intelligible. While chart headings helps you understand what each chart shows, it'd be nice to add descriptions to help you remember what each version in your A/B test represents. In the next lesson, you'll add a description for each design version. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version If you already had the CLI, update it: bash Copy $ nr1 update Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start.

      "body": "Imagine you've developed a website and instrumented it with New Relic's Browser monitoring. New Relic's core feature set provides a lot of information, but you want something custom. You want to decide if a new design for your site will better engage your users. In other words, you want to A/B test a design and make a decision based on the data. For this task, you could create a New Relic One application, using React, the New Relic One software development kit, and the limitless power of modern web technologies. New Relic One applications are built with one of web development's most popular JavaScript libraries: React. Because you have freedom when writing React code, you can customize your app logic, design your own components, or take advantage of the abundance of open source component libraries. So, for your A/B test app, if you want to write custom logic to end the test based on results, you can do so. The New Relic One software development kit (SDK) allows you to create, serve, publish, and deploy applications to New Relic One. It also provides a host of React components for gathering data, presenting information, handling user interactions, and more. You use components like Button and Dropdown to create an interactive experience that looks and feels native to New Relic. You use Table and Chart components to display data from your New Relic account or elsewhere. When building your A/B test application, you'd use the SDK's NrqlQuery component to fetch Browser data from your account. With custom React code, SDK components, and the wide world of open source libraries, you can create your A/B test application in New Relic One. But before you create one for yourself, you might want to check the app catalog to see if someone has beaten you to it! If the catalog already had an app for that, you could add it to your account with a couple clicks, another benefit of creating apps in New Relic One. Throughout this course, you’re going to build a real-world New Relic One application for running and managing A/B tests. You’ll visualize Browser data for your competing designs, see historical data from past tests, and even choose a winning design and end the test, all from your New Relic One application! But before you get into the weeds of building charts and making http requests, you need to learn what New Relic One applications are made of.

You might introduce a bug in a release, overlook an edge case, or rely on a broken dependency. These issues, and others, can result in bad user experiences. In this guide, you: Use the open-source New Relic demo-deployer to spin up the infrastructure for Acme Telco Lite, a fictional company. This demo scenario is part of our Demo Catalog and will simulate real-world issues in a controlled, demo environment Use New Relic to understand those issues from the perspective of a Telco Lite developer Use the deployer to tear down the resources you create Welcome to Acme Telco Lite! Acme Telco Lite is a mock telecom business that maintains an eCommerce website for its customers. The site's architecture has eight, interconnected microservices, plus a simulator: The simulator isn't part of the Telco Lite infrastructure, but it is part of the demo deployment. It runs scenarios against the application to create web traffic and generate interesting data in New Relic. Set up your environment Before you begin, follow the Prerequisites guide from the deployer's GitHub repository for a detailed walkthrough of how to set up your environment. For this guide, you can choose between Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host your deployment. The guide steps you through: Installing Docker & pulling the demo-deployer image locally Creating a user config file containing credentials for New Relic and your cloud provider Downloading a .pem key file (if your cloud provider is AWS) Once you're all set up, deploy Acme Telco Lite. Deploy Telco Lite It's time to deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services using demo-deployer. Copy the url for the demo that corresponds to the cloud provider you chose when you set up your environment: AWS Telco Lite Demo Azure Telco Lite Demo GCP Telco Lite Demo Follow the Deployment guide in the Demo Catalog repository for a thorough explanation of how to use the deployer in a local Docker environment. When you run the deployment script, make sure to pass the url you copied for <demo-url>. Tip Since Telco Lite contains several services, the deployment can take over half an hour. When the deloyer is finished, you should see some output stating that the deployment was successful: bash Copy [INFO] Executing Deployment [✔] Parsing and validating Deployment configuration success [✔] Provisioner success [✔] Installing On-Host instrumentation success [✔] Installing Services and instrumentations success [INFO] Deployment successful!

View your services With your services running in the cloud, log in to New Relic and select APM from the top navigation to see how your services are holding up: Yikes! The alerts, high response times, and red-colored indicators suggest things aren't well. Use New Relic to diagnose these issues, which are simultaneously affecting your services: Issue 1: The Warehouse Portal has abnormally high response times Issue 2: Multiple services are raising error alerts Tip Don't worry if you don't see all the same alerts. The simulator triggers issues at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. Tear down Telco Lite When you're finished diagnosing all the issues effecting Telco Lite, follow the Teardown guide in the deployer's repository to tear down the services you created in your cloud provider. If you're still exploring, don't tear down your services, or you'll have to deploy them again later. Conclusion Congratulations, you're done!

      "body": "Problem Your New Relic's synthetic Simple, Scripted, or Scripted API (non-ping) monitor reported an error, but the application appears to have loaded correctly. For ping and simple monitor errors, see non-scripted monitor errors. Solutions Below are some of the most common non-ping monitor error messages. Simple or scripted browser errors Element A is not clickable at point (X, Y). Other element would receive the click: Element B Problem The synthetic script is attempting to .click() an element (Element A) at point (X,Y), but another element (Element B) is obscuring the target element. Solution Set a custom wait time, allowing time for a specific condition to be met. In this case, until the loading animation is no longer visible: .then(function() { return $browser.wait($driver.until.elementIsNotVisible($browser.findElement($driver.By.id('LOADING'))), 10000); }) Copy Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Tip This will not correct .click() issues caused by sticky headers or footers. In these instances, you may need to scroll manually to bring the target into view. Cause This happens if the target element, at the time of the .click() function, is obscured by: A loading overlay, modal, or pop-up An animation that reveals the target element A sticky header or footer Error: element not visible Problem The targeted element is not visible to the Selenium WebDriver. Solution Verify that the targeted element does not have the CSS properties of display: none or visibility: hidden applied. Cause Any element that has a CSS property of display: none or visibility: hidden will not be found by the Selenium WebDriver, as the script will only look for elements that are actually visible to a user. Error: no such element: Unable to locate element: <LOCATOR> Problem The Selenium WebDriver was unable to find this element in the visible DOM. Solution To resolve this problem: Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath where possible as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure, and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. If element is in an iframe, use $browser.switchTo().frame(<index or element reference>. Tip See the Selenium documentation for more information on switchTo() and TargetLocator() functions. Cause Common reasons for this error include: The targeted element is unable to be located by functions such as: $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) or $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [ , timeout: number This may be due to a timing issue. For example, the WebDriver is attempting to locate the element before the page has been loaded. Element is in an iframe, which is a separate document context. JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. NetworkError: Monitor produced no traffic Problem The API test or scripted browser monitor appears to be running but is returning this error. Solution Ensure that $http.get() or $browser.get() are being called appropriately and are generating traffic. For Scripted API monitors, if you are using a request option to spin up an un-instrumented HTTP agent under the hood, specify one of our instrumented HTTP agents using either of the agent request options below: $globalAgents.http $globalAgents.https Example: var options = { uri: 'https://www.newrelic.com', agent: $globalAgents.https, agentOptions: { 'rejectUnauthorized': false }, strictSSL: false }; function callback(err, res, body) { ... }; $http.get(options, callback); Copy Cause This occurs in scripted monitor runs when the HTTP client ($http in scripted api monitors) or Chrome browser ($browser in scripted browser monitors) is not used to generate HTTP traffic. In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by synthetic monitoring, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the monitor's settings. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assigned the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. StaleElementReferenceError: element is not attached to the page document Problem The target page has loaded, but there was a change to an element between the execution of an element locator and an action being executed on the element. Solution Set your scripted browser to wait until the page is settled before performing a findElement() action. This can be accomplished by setting a custom wait time, using the $browser.wait(fn, timeout) function prior to the findElement call, to wait for a condition that indicates a settled page state. This will make it less likely for DOM manipulation to cause a reference to go stale. Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Cause This error typically happens when the script attempts to .click() an element after using either the findElement() or waitForAndFindElement() function. If the DOM has changed between when the element locator was generated and the action was executed against the element, this error will occur because the actual element has changed. For example: the findElement() function is used to generate an element reference while the page’s script is actively manipulating the DOM. The DOM is then changed, causing the previously generated reference to become stale. The now out-of-date reference is used in an attempt to perform a .click() action, resulting in this monitor failure. Tip For more information, see the Selenium documentation on Stale Element Reference Exceptions. TaskTimedOut: task timed-out waiting for element to be located using: <LOCATOR> Problem The waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function failed to locate an element within the provided timeout. Solution Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath() where possible, as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. Cause The target element did not exist on the page when the waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function was called. This may be caused by the target page not being in the expected state. Common reasons for this error include: There is a legitimate issue with the target site. The element locator being used is incorrect. The target site has changed, requiring the revision of the Synthetics script. The previous action in the script did not successfully complete, causing the page to be in an unexpected state when the subsequent waitForAndFindElement() call was initiated. TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Problem The target page loaded successfully, but returned the error: TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Solution If the failures began suddenly, investigate any requests that could be blocking or delaying the page load event. If you are unsure which request is causing the error, use the timeline view to identify any long running HTTP requests. If the page is frequently unable to fully load within the current timeout, set a custom page load timeout using the $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) function. Cause The target page loaded successfully, but the page load event was not fired within the page load timeout set in the .pageLoadTimeout() function. There are a number of reasons you could see this error message, including: A blocked resource request on the page held up the page load. A resource request processed slower than normal due to an underlying network issue. A dependent resource on the page blocked the iframe load event. TypeError: $browser.isElementPresent is not a function Problem The function isElementPresent(), used by Synthetics monitors with a runtime >= 0.5.0, has been deprecated in Selenium 3. Solution To continue to use this function after depreciation you will need to create a custom version of this function, such as: return $browser.findElements(ele).then(function(found) { return found.length > 0; }); } Copy Example usage, which would return true: $browser .get(\"https://www.newrelic.com\") .then(function() { return isElementPresent($driver.By.id(\"nav_signup\")); }) .then(function(found) { return console.log(found); }); Copy Cause This can occur when attempting to use a scripted browser monitor script from an older monitor ( < = 0.4.1 runtime) with a newer monitor ( >= 0.5.0) runtime. Scripted API monitor errors JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout.

ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the Monitor Settings page. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes.

If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. SyntaxError: Unexpected token < Problem JSON.parse() was passed a string that begins with the < character and is likely HTML, instead of JSON. Solution Ensure the target endpoint is returning the expected response body. You can do this by logging the response body in the callback, before attempting to parse. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(body); // Log HTML response body, don't parse as JSON }); Copy Depending on the target API endpoint, you may need to include specific request headers to ensure that JSON is returned. Cause The script is attempting to use JSON.parse() on a response body after a request is made and is expecting the endpoint to return JSON, but HTML was returned instead. SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0 Problem JSON.parse() was passed an undefined parameter, but expected a JSON string. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } var bodyJson = JSON.parse(body); console.log(bodyJson); // Log response body }); Copy Cause This can occur in Scripted API monitors when a performing an API request, then attempting to parse the request response within the callback function. The response body is passed to JSON.parse() without checking if the response body is undefined first. An undefined response body is often caused by a request error. If there is no error handling to prevent code that parses the response body, this monitor failure will occur. TypeError: Cannot read property 'statusCode' of undefined Problem The response object (and thus response.statusCode) in an API request callback is undefined. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(response.statusCode); }); Copy Cause This error occurs when there was an error completing the API request (for example, unable to reach server, unable to resolve DNS). In these instances, the request was not completed so the response object in the callback function arguments is undefined. If there is no error handling to prevent code that checks response status code, this monitor failure will occur.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you learned of a third-party service that you can use to fetch mock cancellation data for the Total cancellations per version chart in your New Relic One application. Even though the data in this service is fake, the real value of this lesson is learning how you can use third party services to supply data to your New Relic One application. If you make a request to the mock service with cancellation data (https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations) you'll see a response rejecting your request with a message that reads \"Unauthorized\": bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations Unauthorized This is because the Nerdsletter API requires an Authorization header. More specifically, you must pass a bearer token of ABC123 to gain authorized access to its data. If you make a request to the service with the header Authorization: Bearer ABC123, you'll get a successful response with the mocked cancellation data: bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations -H 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' {\"a\": 15, \"b\": 78} In the last lesson, you used NerdGraph to store this API token in your New Relic One application's NerdStorageVault data store. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component and logged its use to your browser's console. In this lesson, you follow up that log statement with a real request to the Nerdsletter API using your authorization token. Then, you supply the data from that external resource to your Total cancellations per version chart. Step 1 of 6 Change to the third-party-services/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/third-party-services/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 6 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js, make a request to api.nerdsletter.net with your API token. Save the results to state, and use that state in render(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { cancellations: [], lastToken: null } } generateChartData(data) { const cancellationsA = data ? data.a : 0; const cancellationsB = data ? data.b : 0; return [ { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsA }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsB }, ], }, ] } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`Requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) fetch( \"https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations\", {headers: {\"Authorization\": `Bearer ${this.props.token}`}} ).then( (response) => { if (response.status == 200) { return response.json() } else if (response.status == 401) { console.error(\"Incorrect auth header\") } else { console.error(response.text()) } } ).then( (data) => { if (data) { this.setState({ cancellations: this.generateChartData(data), lastToken: this.props.token }) } } ) } } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={this.state.cancellations} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy In this code, you initialize TotalCancellations.state.cancellations with zero for the y-value in each series instead of the previously hardcoded values. This helps to more realistically represent what the chart should show if your New Relic One app hasn't successfully requested data from the Nerdsletter API. Next, you use Javascript's fetch() function to make an HTTP request to the Nerdsletter API. You then pass your token in the request's Authorization header. If the request is successful, you update the cancellation data in TotalCancellations.state so that that data is reflected in the component's render method. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/third-party-service/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. If your token in NerdStorageVault is not \"ABC123\", then your console will show an error that reads, \"Incorrect auth header\": If you set the token to \"ABC123\", then Total cancellations per version updates to show the values from the third-party service: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great job! You've come a long way from running nr1 nerdpack:create for the first time. Take a look back at your design guide to see that your application now has everything from an interface and data perspective that you planned from the beginning: You've created eight charts with varying styles and supplied them with dynamic data from multiple sources. You've learned about the New Relic One SDK and used many of its components. You've even gathered data from a third-party service and mixed it seemlessly with your New Relic data to provide a complete look at how the competing versions in your A/B test perform against each other. From here, there is only one more set of APIs in the New Relic One SDK that you've yet to get your hands on: Platform APIs. These will come in handy in improving the usability of your New Relic One application.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you used PlatformStateContext from the New Relic One SDK to look up the time range that the user selected from the app's time picker. Now, you'll learn about another component that interacts with the New Relic platform: navigation. The navigation component lets you open entities, navigate to entities, and build Location objects for entities from your Nerdlet. You can also use navigation for other Nerdlets and launchers. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-navigation/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In newsletter-signups.js, create a new method, called NewsletterSignups.openApmEntity(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. This method uses navigation.openStackedEntity() to display your demo application's APM entity in a stacked view. Notice openApmEntity() requires your ENTITY_GUID. You need to locate that ID and store it in a constant. Step 3 of 10 Navigate to APM: See metadata for your Newsletter service: Copy the entity's GUID: Create an ENTITY_GUID constant: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and the entity GUID you just copied, respectively. Now, openApmEntity() knows what entity to show. Next, you need to create a button to invoke this method. Step 4 of 10 Create a button to show your APM entity: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you've created a button and configured it to call openApmEntity() when it's clicked. Step 5 of 10 Import Stack and StackItem: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. You'll use Stack and StackItem to lay out the button on the far right side of the same row that the HeadingText is on. Step 6 of 10 Lay out the Stack: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <Stack fullWidth> <StackItem grow={true}> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> </StackItem> <StackItem> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> </StackItem> </Stack> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you used a full-width Stack to set up the layout for the row. To make the HeadingText fill the entire row except the width of the button, you used the StackItem.grow prop. Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. Click App performance: Now you see the stacked entity: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively Congratulations! You're finished writing all the code you'll write for your New Relic One A/B test application. Now, you have an application reporting New Relic data from your demo service that is running an A/B test. You've created several charts, buttons, and other UI elements. And you've organized your components into a readable and usable view. On top of the visuals, you've supplied data to your charts from multiple data sources in and outside of New Relic. You've created some backend functionality which utilizes your New Relic One application's own data store. You've also utilized the platform APIs for interacting with platform UI and showing a stacked entity view. You've really accomplished a lot throughout this course, so far. There are only a few things left to do! First, is to learn how to publish and subscribe to your New Relic One application so that it can run on our platform instead of your own local server. Second, is to learn how to deal with some common issues you might see in New Relic One application development. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Describe your app for the catalog.",

      "info": "Add a time picker to a sample application",
      "body": "This guide steps you through the process of adding access to our time picker in the sample transaction overview application. The sample application provides an overview of the telemetry data showing your account's transactions by application, average response time, HTTP response codes, and transaction errors. When you enable the time picker, users can specify the time range of data to view. We also have a 12 minute video that covers the steps below. Before you begin To develop projects, you need our New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete steps 1–4 of the CLI quick start. In step 1, be sure to make a copy of the number preceding your account name. This is your accound ID, and you’ll need it later. Important If you've already installed the New Relic One CLI, but you can't remember your account ID, start the CLI quick start again, and then click the Get your API key down arrow. The account ID is the number preceding your account name. For additional details, see Set up your development environment. Prepare the time picker sample code To get started, complete these steps to update the application UUID (unique ID) and run the sample application locally: Step 1 of 7 If you haven't already done so, clone the example applications from our how-to GitHub repo. bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git Step 2 of 7 Change to the directory nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet: bash Copy $ cd nr1-how-to/add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet Step 3 of 7 In your preferred text editor, open index.js. Step 4 of 7 Replace <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID> with your account id: Important Your account ID is available in the CLI quick start (see Before you begin). this.accountId = <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID>; Copy Step 5 of 7 Change to the add-time-picker directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/add-time-picker Step 6 of 7 Execute these commands to update the UUID and serve the sample application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 7 of 7 Once the sample application is successfully served, go to the local version of New Relic One (https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local) click Apps, and click Add Time Picker. After launching the Add Time Picker application, you see a dashboard that gives an overview of the transactions in your New Relic account: By default, the application shows your data within the last 60 minutes. If you toggle the time picker, it doesn't update the charts because the transaction overview application isn't connected to the New Relic One platform. It has no access to the data from the time picker. In the following sections, you'll add the time picker to the example application and add the time to the queries. Import the PlatformStateContext component The first step in adding the time picker is to import the PlatformStateContext component. Important If you need more details about the PlatformStateContext example that follows, see the APIs and components page Here's what the PlatformStateContext component does: Wraps all of the code within the return statement of the render method Makes a function call passing in the New Relic platform state Returns all of the code within our current return statement Complete these steps: Step 1 of 5 In a text editor, open /add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet/index.js. Step 2 of 5 Add the PlatformStateContext component to the end of the import statement so it looks like this: import { Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 3 of 5 Just below the current return insert this code for the PlatformStateContext component: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { return ( // ADD THE CURRENT RETURN CODE HERE ) }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> Copy Step 4 of 5 Move the current application code so it is under the return of the platformState function call. The return statement should now look like this: return ( <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> ); Copy Step 5 of 5 Add a console.log statement to make sure you are seeing appropriate data. Insert the following code inside the PlatformState return statement just before the opening tag for the <Grid> component: /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ console.log(platformState); Copy After you complete these steps, your browser console displays something like this: Add the time to the queries In your console, you should see some data from the New Relic platform state. Now you're ready to add timeRange data to update the charts in the transaction overview application. This step requires you to import the timeRangeToNrql utility method from the New Relic One community library. Important You can get more details on the New Relic One community library from our GitHub repo. This helper method takes your PlatformState.timeRange duration data, formats it from milliseconds, and returns a formatted SINCE statement to add to your NRQL. Step 1 of 4 Import the timeRangeToNrql method by inserting this line of code below the other import sections: Important You don't need to include the AccountDropdown from the community import example. import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; Copy Step 2 of 4 Pass the platformState to the timeRangeToNrql helper, and save its output as a since statement for later use: const since = timeRangeToNrql(platformState); Copy Step 3 of 4 After creating the since variable, go through the code in the PlatformStateContext return statement and concatenate the since variable in each of the existing chart component queries. Here's a TableChart example: <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview + since} />; Copy Step 4 of 4 After you update all of the chart components, confirm that the final index.js file looks similar to this: Important This completed sample code is in your nerdlet final.js. import React from 'react'; import { PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart, } from 'nr1'; import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.accountId = 1; } render() { const avgResTime = `SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES AUTO `; const trxOverview = `FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) as 'Transactions', apdex(duration) as 'apdex', percentile(duration, 99, 95) FACET appName `; const errCount = `FROM TransactionError SELECT count(*) as 'Transaction Errors' FACET error.message `; const responseCodes = `SELECT count(*) as 'Response Code' FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode `; return ( <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { /* Taking a peek at the platformState */ console.log(platformState); const since = timeRangeToNrql(platformState); console.log(since); return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount + since} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> ); } } Copy Summary When you completed all the steps in this example, you successfully implemented the time picker in your application by importing the PlatformStateContext component and accessing its timePicker data object.",

      "info": "Intro to New Relic One SDK",
      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add a grid, before starting this one. Organizing charts is one way to clarify the information you're trying to convey to your users. Headings are another. Since you have several charts on the same page, use headings to describe the information they show. To remember what data each chart presents, consult your design guide: The design guide details what data each chart shows. Use those details to craft useful headings for your charts. Step 1 of 6 Change to the add-chart-headings/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-chart-headings/ab-test Step 2 of 6 In newsletter-signups.js, page-views.js, past-tests.js, total-cancellations.js, total-subscriptions.js, and totals.js, import HeadingText and add a descriptive heading above the chart in each of your custom components: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } const versionBSignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-b-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 20 }, { x: 10, y: 5 }, { x: 20, y: 25 }, { x: 30, y: 45 }, { x: 40, y: 50 }, { x: 50, y: 35 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionASignups, versionBSignups]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [ { \"endDate\": \"12-15-2020\", \"versionADescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was green.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was blue.\", \"winner\": \"A\" }, { \"endDate\": \"09-06-2019\", \"versionADescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a carousel.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a grid.\", \"winner\": \"B\" } ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { const versionATotals = { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[versionATotals]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Notice the new <div> tag in each render(), which allows you to return multiple elements at once. Also, remember that we provided you a CSS stylesheet that styles the chartHeader class. You can look at nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss to see more. You don't need to modify your Nerdlet's render() method in index.js because your components encapsulate the new code. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see that your charts have descriptive headings. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Well done! You've created all the charts that are laid out in your design guide. You’ve also organized them into a neat grid and added headings so that the charts are intelligible. While chart headings helps you understand what each chart shows, it'd be nice to add descriptions to help you remember what each version in your A/B test represents. In the next lesson, you'll add a description for each design version. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

The sample application provides an overview of the telemetry data showing your account's transactions by application, average response time, HTTP response codes, and transaction errors. When you enable the time picker, users can specify the time range of data to view. We also have a 12 minute video that covers the steps below. Before you begin To develop projects, you need our New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete steps 1–4 of the CLI quick start. In step 1, be sure to make a copy of the number preceding your account name. This is your accound ID, and you’ll need it later. Important If you've already installed the New Relic One CLI, but you can't remember your account ID, start the CLI quick start again, and then click the Get your API key down arrow. The account ID is the number preceding your account name. For additional details, see Set up your development environment. Prepare the time picker sample code To get started, complete these steps to update the application UUID (unique ID) and run the sample application locally: Step 1 of 7 If you haven't already done so, clone the example applications from our how-to GitHub repo. bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git Step 2 of 7 Change to the directory nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet: bash Copy $ cd nr1-how-to/add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet Step 3 of 7 In your preferred text editor, open index.js. Step 4 of 7 Replace <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID> with your account id: Important Your account ID is available in the CLI quick start (see Before you begin). this.accountId = <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID>; Copy Step 5 of 7 Change to the add-time-picker directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/add-time-picker Step 6 of 7 Execute these commands to update the UUID and serve the sample application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 7 of 7 Once the sample application is successfully served, go to the local version of New Relic One (https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local) click Apps, and click Add Time Picker. After launching the Add Time Picker application, you see a dashboard that gives an overview of the transactions in your New Relic account: By default, the application shows your data within the last 60 minutes. If you toggle the time picker, it doesn't update the charts because the transaction overview application isn't connected to the New Relic One platform. It has no access to the data from the time picker. In the following sections, you'll add the time picker to the example application and add the time to the queries. Import the PlatformStateContext component The first step in adding the time picker is to import the PlatformStateContext component. Important If you need more details about the PlatformStateContext example that follows, see the APIs and components page Here's what the PlatformStateContext component does: Wraps all of the code within the return statement of the render method Makes a function call passing in the New Relic platform state Returns all of the code within our current return statement Complete these steps: Step 1 of 5 In a text editor, open /add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet/index.js. Step 2 of 5 Add the PlatformStateContext component to the end of the import statement so it looks like this: import { Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 3 of 5 Just below the current return insert this code for the PlatformStateContext component: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { return ( // ADD THE CURRENT RETURN CODE HERE ) }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> Copy Step 4 of 5 Move the current application code so it is under the return of the platformState function call. The return statement should now look like this: return ( <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> ); Copy Step 5 of 5 Add a console.log statement to make sure you are seeing appropriate data. Insert the following code inside the PlatformState return statement just before the opening tag for the <Grid> component: /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ console.log(platformState); Copy After you complete these steps, your browser console displays something like this: Add the time to the queries In your console, you should see some data from the New Relic platform state. Now you're ready to add timeRange data to update the charts in the transaction overview application. This step requires you to import the timeRangeToNrql utility method from the New Relic One community library. Important You can get more details on the New Relic One community library from our GitHub repo. This helper method takes your PlatformState.timeRange duration data, formats it from milliseconds, and returns a formatted SINCE statement to add to your NRQL. Step 1 of 4 Import the timeRangeToNrql method by inserting this line of code below the other import sections: Important You don't need to include the AccountDropdown from the community import example. import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; Copy Step 2 of 4 Pass the platformState to the timeRangeToNrql helper, and save its output as a since statement for later use: const since = timeRangeToNrql(platformState); Copy Step 3 of 4 After creating the since variable, go through the code in the PlatformStateContext return statement and concatenate the since variable in each of the existing chart component queries. Here's a TableChart example: <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview + since} />; Copy Step 4 of 4 After you update all of the chart components, confirm that the final index.js file looks similar to this: Important This completed sample code is in your nerdlet final.js. import React from 'react'; import { PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart, } from 'nr1'; import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.accountId = 1; } render() { const avgResTime = `SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES AUTO `; const trxOverview = `FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) as 'Transactions', apdex(duration) as 'apdex', percentile(duration, 99, 95) FACET appName `; const errCount = `FROM TransactionError SELECT count(*) as 'Transaction Errors' FACET error.message `; const responseCodes = `SELECT count(*) as 'Response Code' FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode `; return ( <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { /* Taking a peek at the platformState */ console.log(platformState); const since = timeRangeToNrql(platformState); console.log(since); return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount + since} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> ); } } Copy Summary When you completed all the steps in this example, you successfully implemented the time picker in your application by importing the PlatformStateContext component and accessing its timePicker data object.",

      "body": "This guide steps you through the process of adding the `NerdGraphQuery` component to a sample transaction overview application. This allows you to query data from your New Relic account and add it to a dropdown menu. NerdGraph is our GraphQL implementation. GraphQL has some key differences when compared to REST: The client, not the server, determines what data is returned. You can easily collect data from multiple sources. For example, in a single query, you can get account information, infrastructure data, and issue a NRQL request. Important Before completing this exercise, you can experiment with GraphQL queries in our NerdGraph API explorer. We also have a 14-minute video that covers the steps below. Before you begin To develop projects, you need our New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete steps 1–4 of our CLI quick start, and be sure to make a copy of your account ID from step 1 because you’ll need it later. Important If you've already installed the New Relic One CLI, but you can't remember your account ID, start the CLI quick start again, and then click the Get your API key down arrow. The account ID is the number preceding your account name. For additional details, see Set up your development environment. Prepare the sample code To get started, complete these steps to update the application UUID (unique ID) and run the sample application locally: Step 1 of 8 If you haven't already done so, clone the example applications from our how-to GitHub repo. Here's an example using HTTPS: bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git Step 2 of 8 Change to the directory use-nerdgraph-nerdlet: bash Copy $ cd nr1-how-to/use-nerdgraph/nerdlets/use-nerdgraph-nerdlet Step 3 of 8 In your preferred text editor, open index.js. Step 4 of 8 Replace <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID> with your account id: Important Your account ID is available in the CLI quick start (see Before you begin). this.accountId = <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID>; Copy Step 5 of 8 Change to the /nr1-howto/use-nerdgraph directory: bash Copy $ cd ../.. Step 6 of 8 If this is your first time executing this code run the below command to install all the required modules: bash Copy $ npm install Step 7 of 8 Execute these commands to update the UUID and serve the sample application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 Once the sample application is successfully served, go to the local New Relic One homepage (https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local), click Apps, and then click Use NerdGraph. After launching the Use NerdGraph application, you see a dashboard that gives an overview of the transactions in your account: Add the NerdGraphQuery component Now you can create a dropdown menu for changing the account the application is viewing. The first step is to import the NerdGraphQuery component into the application's index.js file. Important If you need more details about our example below, see the APIs and components page on https://developer.newrelic.com Step 1 of 3 Add the NerdGraphQuery component into the first StackItem inside of the return in the index.js file: <NerdGraphQuery query={query} variables={variables}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { console.log({ loading, error, data }); if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { return 'Error!'; } return null; }} </NerdGraphQuery>; Copy Step 2 of 3 The NerdGraphQuery component takes a query object that states the source you want to access and the data you want returned. Add the following code to your index.js file in the render method: Important In the browser console, you can see the data from your query returned in an object that follows the same structure of the object in the initial query. const query = ` query($id: Int!) { actor { account(id: $id) { name } } } `; Copy Step 3 of 3 To take the data returned by the NerdGraph query and display it in the application, replace the return null in the current NerdGraphQuery component with this return statement: return <HeadingText>{data.actor.account.name} Apps:</HeadingText>; Copy When you go back to the browser and view your application, you see a new headline showing the name of your account returned from NerdGraph: How to use NerdGraphQuery.query At this point, you have implemented the NerdGraphQuery component with the application's render method and displayed the return data within the transaction overview application. Here's what you need to do next: Query NerdGraph inside of the componentDidMount lifecycle method. Save the returned data for later use in the application. Step 1 of 2 This code takes the response from NerdGraph and makes sure the results are processed, stored into the application state, and logged to the browser console for viewing. Add this code into the index.js file just under the constructor: componentDidMount() { const accountId = this.state; const gql = `{ actor { accounts { id name } } }`; const accounts = NerdGraphQuery.query({query: gql}) //The NerdGraphQuery.query method called with the query object to get your account data is stored in the accounts variable. accounts.then(results => { console.log('Nerdgraph Response:', results); const accounts = results.data.actor.accounts.map(account => { return account; }); const account = accounts.length > 0 && accounts[0]; this.setState({ selectedAccount: account, accounts }); }).catch((error) => { console.log('Nerdgraph Error:', error); }) } Copy Step 2 of 2 After the data is stored into state, display a selection so users can change accounts and update the application. To do this, add this code to index.js for the second StackItem in the return statement: { accounts && ( <StackItem> <Select value={selectedAccount} onChange={(evt, value) => this.selectAccount(value)} > {accounts.map((a) => { return ( <SelectItem key={a.id} value={a}> {a.name} </SelectItem> ); })} </Select> </StackItem> ); } Copy Review the results of the NerdGraph query After you complete these steps, look at the application in your browser, and note the following: The dropdown menu now displays the data returned from the NerdGraphQuery.query and allows you to select an account. After you select a new account, the application shows data from the new selection. The final index.js file should have code similar to the code below. This completed sample is in your nerdlet final.js. import React from 'react'; import { PlatformStateContext, NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, HeadingText, Grid, GridItem, Stack, StackItem, Select, SelectItem, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart } from 'nr1' import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class UseNerdgraphNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.state = { accountId: <YOUR ACCOUNT ID>, accounts: null, selectedAccount: null, } } componentDidMount() { const accountId = this.state; const gql = `{ actor { accounts { id name } } }`; const accounts = NerdGraphQuery.query({ query: gql }) accounts.then(results => { console.log('Nerdgraph Response:', results); const accounts = results.data.actor.accounts.map(account => { return account; }); const account = accounts.length > 0 && accounts[0]; this.setState({ selectedAccount: account, accounts }); }).catch((error) => { console.log('Nerdgraph Error:', error); }) } selectAccount(option) { this.setState({ accountId: option.id, selectedAccount: option }); } render() { const { accountId, accounts, selectedAccount } = this.state; console.log({ accountId, accounts, selectedAccount }); const query = ` query($id: Int!) { actor { account(id: $id) { name } } } `; const variables = { id: accountId, }; const avgResTime = `SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES AUTO `; const trxOverview = `FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) as 'Transactions', apdex(duration) as 'apdex', percentile(duration, 99, 95) FACET appName `; const errCount = `FROM TransactionError SELECT count(*) as 'Transaction Errors' FACET error.message `; const responseCodes = `SELECT count(*) as 'Response Code' FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode `; return ( <Stack fullWidth horizontalType={Stack.HORIZONTAL_TYPE.FILL} gapType={Stack.GAP_TYPE.EXTRA_LOOSE} spacingType={[Stack.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} directionType={Stack.DIRECTION_TYPE.VERTICAL}> <StackItem> <NerdGraphQuery query={query} variables={variables}> {({loading, error, data}) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { return 'Error!'; } return <HeadingText>{data.actor.account.name} Apps:</HeadingText>; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </StackItem> {accounts && <StackItem> <Select value={selectedAccount} onChange={(evt, value) => this.selectAccount(value)}> {accounts.map(a => { return ( <SelectItem key={a.id} value={a}> {a.name} </SelectItem> ) })} </Select> </StackItem> } <StackItem> <hr /> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { /* Taking a peek at the platformState */ const since = timeRangeToNrql(platformState); return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={trxOverview+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={avgResTime+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={responseCodes+since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}> Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={accountId} query={errCount+since} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </StackItem> </Stack> ) } } Copy Summary Now that you've completed all the steps in this example, you've successfully queried data from your account using the NerdGraphQuery component in two methods: Using the NerdGraphQuery component inside the application's render method and then passing the returned data into the children's components.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Present an end test confirmation modal, before starting this one. In this series, you're building a full-fledged New Relic One application that ingests data from a demo service that's running an A/B test. The app shows the A/B test data in interesting ways so that you'll ultimately be able to choose whether Version A or Version B is more effective at accomplishing your business goal: to increase high-quality newsletter subscriptions. In past tutorials, you created charts to visualize your data, and you organized those charts so you can use and understand them. You also created a form in your app for ending your test once you're confident in the most effective version. Until now, though, you can't gauge which version is more effective because your charts have been showing mock data, such as: const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } Copy A chart's data prop is useful for supplying manually-crafted data like this or even reformatted third-party data. But for many of your charts, you want to show real-time New Relic data. For example, Newsletter subscriptions by version should show subscription data, which exists in New Relic's database, NRDB for short. To query NRDB, you first need to know what data you're looking for. Remember your demo backend service? Well, that service reports a subscription event to New Relic when a user subscribes to a newsletter from your site. You can view these subscription events in New Relic while your demo services are running. View Subscription Events in New Relic Before you query NRDB from your charts, experiment with querying data from New Relic's web interface. Step 1 of 3 From your New Relic homepage, go to to the Data explorer from the top navigation menu: Data explorer lets you explore your telemetry data: metrics events logs traces Since the backend submits newsletter subscriptions as events to New Relic, you can see them in this view. Step 2 of 3 Select subscription from the Custom events menu: This queries NRDB for subscription event totals per minute over the last 30 minutes and shows that data in a chart: Step 3 of 3 Click Dimensions to see a list of the attributes associated with these subscription events: You can filter and group subscription events using these dimensions. Notice the NRQL query above the chart. This shows the chart's underlying query, which is based on these dimensions. Click the page-version dimension to see the query change to group by FACET page_version: The Data explorer presents two options for filtering and sorting your data: User interface (UI) selections like the one you've just made New Relic Query Language (NRQL) The UI is useful for quickly filtering data, and it doesn't require you to know NRQL. For your New Relic One application, however, you need to use NRQL queries. Click the NRQL query to navigate to the Query builder: Here, you can view and manually edit the query to fetch the data you need. Update NewsletterSignups with a NrqlQuery Before you begin integrating New Relic data in your NR1 app, consult your design guide: Your New Relic One application has eight charts in total, including line charts, pie charts, and table charts. Each of these charts currently shows mock data, but they need to show real data to be useful. First, focus on querying data for the topmost chart: Newsletter subscriptions per version. With the query you've built in the Data explorer, you already have the data you need for this chart: Technical detail In your query, you fetch subscription totals (SELECT count(*) FROM subscriptions), group them by their page version (FACET page_version), and focus the timeseries to the past 30 minutes (SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES). Explore our documentation to learn more about NRQL queries. Next, you learn how to pass your NRQL query to your Newsletter subscriptions per version chart. Step 1 of 7 Change to the add-nrql-components/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nrql-components/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, update the LineChart in NewsletterSignups. Remove the mock data, and use the NRQL query you built in the Data explorer: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. In NrqlQuery, you set two props: accountId: The id for the account you query from query: The query to perform With these, your NR1 app can query the data you want to show in your chart. Tip There is a convenience prop for using NRQL to supply data to your charts, called query. If you'd rather not use the NrqlQuery component, try the query prop instead: <LineChart accountId={<YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID>} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" /> Copy Keep in mind you must still supply the accountId. Step 3 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nrql-components/ab-test. Step 4 of 7 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 7 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 7 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: Newsletter subscriptions by version now shows real data from New Relic's database rather than the mock data you defined before. Notice that your chart pulls data when your application loads, but does not continue pulling data while the application is open. You can fix this by adding another prop. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 7 of 7 Add a pollInterval: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. The pollInterval is the number of milliseconds between chart refreshes. Each time the chart refreshes, it queries fresh data from New Relic. In this case, you refresh every minute. Populate your PieChart with subscription event data Now that you've seen how to passed New Relic data to Newsletter subscriptions per version, it's time to move on to Total subscriptions per version. These two charts are similar in that they compare subscription event data grouped by version. The primary differences between Newsletter subscriptions per version and Total subscriptions per version are: One is a line chart and one is a pie chart One shows timeseries data and one shows all-time totals Step 1 of 2 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js, update the TestDistributions component, removing the mock data and populating the PieChart with the same NRQL query you used for Newsletter subscriptions per version but with different TIMESERIES and SINCE clauses: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, PieChart, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 7 DAYS AGO\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <PieChart data={data} fullWidth /> } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. You don't need the TIMESERIES clause because the pie chart only shows numerical data. You don't need the SINCE clause because Total subscriptions per version needs to show all-time subscription totals. Step 2 of 2 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: Total subscriptions per version now shows all-time subscription totals from both versions of your demo application. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Well done! You've configured some charts to query real subscription data from New Relic's database. Populate charts with pageView event data Consider the remaining charts that still use mock data: Total unsubscriptions per version Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions Version A - Page views Version B - Page views Past tests Some of these charts need to show page view data. Fortunately, your demo application creates a custom event for every page view like it does for subscriptions! Since Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions require data from two sources, ignore these for now and focus on Version A - Page views and Version B - Page views. Step 1 of 2 In page-views.js, remove the mock data from VersionPageViews and use a NrqlQuery component to supply a query: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 2 of 2 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: In these new queries, you fetch pageView custom events instead of subscription events. You also use a WHERE clause to filter to a particular page_version rather than a FACET to group by page_version. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Phew, that's a lot of queries, but your application looks great! You're now showing real data in four charts. Remember the two charts you ignored because they require data from two sources? Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions You have to handle these differently than you did for the charts you've been dealing with because NRQL has no method for querying data from multiple sources. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to supply data to these two charts. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "Loss of signal occurs when New Relic stops receiving data for a while; technically, we detect loss of signal after a significant amount of time has elapsed since data was last received in a time series. Loss of signal can be used to trigger or resolve a violation, which you can use to set up alerts. Gap filling can help you solve issues caused by lost data points. When gaps are detected between valid data points, we automatically fill those gaps with replacement values, such as the last known values or a static value. Gap filling can prevent alerts from triggering or resolving when they shouldn't. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. You can customize loss of signal detection and gap filling using NerdGraph. For example, you can configure how long to wait before considering the signal lost, or what value should be used for filling gaps in the time series. Here are some queries and examples you can use in our NerdGraph API explorer. In this guide we cover the following: Customize loss of signal detection Customize gap filling Customize your loss of signal detection Loss of signal detection opens or closes violations if no data is received after a certain amount of time. For example, if you set the duration of the expiration period to 60 seconds and an integration doesn't seem to send data for more than a minute, a loss of signal violation would be triggered. You can configure the duration of the signal loss and whether to open a violation or close it by using these three fields in NerdGraph: expiration.expirationDuration: How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives at our platform and not on data timestamps. The default is to leave this null, and therefore this wouldn't enable Loss of Signal Detection. expiration.openViolationOnExpiration: If true, a new violation is opened when a signal is lost. Default is false. To use this field, a duration must be specified. expiration.closeViolationsOnExpiration: If true, open violations related to the signal are closed on expiration. Default is false. To use this field, a duration must be specified. View loss of signal settings for an existing condition Existing NRQL conditions may have their loss of signal settings already configured. To view the existing condition settings, select the fields under nrqlCondition > expiration: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: NRQL_CONDITION_ID) { ... on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { id name nrql { query } expiration { closeViolationsOnExpiration expirationDuration openViolationOnExpiration } } } } } } } Copy You should see a result like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlCondition\": { \"expiration\": { \" closeViolationsOnExpiration \": false, \" expirationDuration \": 300, \" openViolationOnExpiration \": true }, \"id\": \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\", \"name\": \"Any less than - Extrapolation\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"SELECT average(value) FROM AlertsSmokeTestSignals WHERE wave_type IN ('min-max', 'single-gap') FACET wave_type\" } } } } } }, ... Copy Create a new condition with loss of signal settings Let's say that you want to create a new create a NRQL static condition that triggers a loss of signal violation after no data is received for two minutes. You would set expirationDuration to 120 seconds and set openViolationOnExpiration to true, like in the example below. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate( accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID condition: { name: \"Low Host Count - Catastrophic\" enabled: true nrql: { query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) from Transaction where appName='my-app-name'\" } signal { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: [{ threshold: 2 thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE thresholdDuration: 600 operator: BELOW priority: CRITICAL }] valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 expiration : { expirationDuration : 120 openViolationOnExpiration : true } } ) { id name } } Copy Update the loss of signal settings of a condition What if you want to update loss of signal parameters for an alert condition? The following mutation allows you to update a NRQL static condition with new expiration values. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate( accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID id: YOUR_STATIC_CONDITION_ID condition: { expiration: { closeViolationsOnExpiration : BOOLEAN expirationDuration : DURATION_IN_SECONDS openViolationOnExpiration : BOOLEAN } } ) { id expiration { closeViolationsOnExpiration expirationDuration openViolationOnExpiration } } } Copy Customize gap filling Gap filling replaces gap values in a time series with either the last value found or a static, arbitrary value of your choice. We fill gaps only after another data point has been received after the gaps in signal (after data reception has been restored). You can configure both the type of filling and the value, if the type is set to static: signal.fillOption: Type of replacement value for lost data points. Values can be: NONE: Gap filling is disabled. LAST_VALUE: The last value seen in the time series. STATIC: An arbitrary value, defined in fillValue. signal.fillValue: Value to use for replacing lost data points when fillOption is set to STATIC. Important Gap filling is also affected by expiration.expirationDuration. When a gap is longer than the expiration duration, the signal is considered expired and the gap will no longer be filled. For example, here's how to create a static NRQL condition with gap filling configured: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate( accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID condition: { enabled: true name: \"Example Gap Filling Condition\" nrql: { query: \"select count(*) from Transaction\" } terms: { operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL threshold: 1000 thresholdDuration: 300 thresholdOccurrences: ALL } valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimitSeconds: 28800 signal: { aggregationWindow: 60, evaluationOffset: 3, fillOption: STATIC, fillValue: 1 } } ) { id } } Copy",

Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query.

All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a New Relic APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. For more on faceting on multiple attributes, with some real-world examples, see this New Relic blog post. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions Here is a listing of the available functions in NRQL. The definitions below contain example NRQL queries. Aggregator functions Use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data in a NRQL query. Some helpful information about using aggregator functions: See the New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. Cohort analysis functions appear on the New Relic Insights Cohort analysis page. The cohort functions aggregate transactions into time segments. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add a section to end your test, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you created a section of your application that allows you to pick the most effective design from your A/B test. The goal of this section is to end the test once you’ve selected a winner: When you select a version from this form, the selection does not persist in the Select component. Now, it’s time to implement that behavior. Step 1 of 11 Change to the persist-selected-version/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/persist-selected-version/ab-test Step 2 of 11 In end-test.js, initialize EndTestSection.state with a default selectedVersion field: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 3 of 11 Pass the selectedVersion, as a prop, to VersionSelector: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 4 of 11 Supply the selectedVersion to your Select component in VersionSelector: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 5 of 11 Create a method, selectVersion(), that updates EndTestSection.state: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy You must bind selectVersion to the EndTestSection component so it can access state. Step 6 of 11 Pass the method to VersionSelector as a prop: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 7 of 11 Set selectVersion as the onChange callback in VersionSelector: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 8 of 11 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/persist-selected-version/ab-test. Step 9 of 11 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 10 of 11 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 11 of 11 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Voila! When you select a new version as the winner of the A/B test, that version is reflected in the menu. However, when you press End test, nothing happens.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Present an end test confirmation modal, before starting this one. In this series, you're building a full-fledged New Relic One application that ingests data from a demo service that's running an A/B test. The app shows the A/B test data in interesting ways so that you'll ultimately be able to choose whether Version A or Version B is more effective at accomplishing your business goal: to increase high-quality newsletter subscriptions. In past tutorials, you created charts to visualize your data, and you organized those charts so you can use and understand them. You also created a form in your app for ending your test once you're confident in the most effective version. Until now, though, you can't gauge which version is more effective because your charts have been showing mock data, such as: const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } Copy A chart's data prop is useful for supplying manually-crafted data like this or even reformatted third-party data. But for many of your charts, you want to show real-time New Relic data. For example, Newsletter subscriptions by version should show subscription data, which exists in New Relic's database, NRDB for short. To query NRDB, you first need to know what data you're looking for. Remember your demo backend service? Well, that service reports a subscription event to New Relic when a user subscribes to a newsletter from your site. You can view these subscription events in New Relic while your demo services are running. View Subscription Events in New Relic Before you query NRDB from your charts, experiment with querying data from New Relic's web interface. Step 1 of 3 From your New Relic homepage, go to to the Data explorer from the top navigation menu: Data explorer lets you explore your telemetry data: metrics events logs traces Since the backend submits newsletter subscriptions as events to New Relic, you can see them in this view. Step 2 of 3 Select subscription from the Custom events menu: This queries NRDB for subscription event totals per minute over the last 30 minutes and shows that data in a chart: Step 3 of 3 Click Dimensions to see a list of the attributes associated with these subscription events: You can filter and group subscription events using these dimensions. Notice the NRQL query above the chart. This shows the chart's underlying query, which is based on these dimensions. Click the page-version dimension to see the query change to group by FACET page_version: The Data explorer presents two options for filtering and sorting your data: User interface (UI) selections like the one you've just made New Relic Query Language (NRQL) The UI is useful for quickly filtering data, and it doesn't require you to know NRQL. For your New Relic One application, however, you need to use NRQL queries. Click the NRQL query to navigate to the Query builder: Here, you can view and manually edit the query to fetch the data you need. Update NewsletterSignups with a NrqlQuery Before you begin integrating New Relic data in your NR1 app, consult your design guide: Your New Relic One application has eight charts in total, including line charts, pie charts, and table charts. Each of these charts currently shows mock data, but they need to show real data to be useful. First, focus on querying data for the topmost chart: Newsletter subscriptions per version. With the query you've built in the Data explorer, you already have the data you need for this chart: Technical detail In your query, you fetch subscription totals (SELECT count(*) FROM subscriptions), group them by their page version (FACET page_version), and focus the timeseries to the past 30 minutes (SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES). Explore our documentation to learn more about NRQL queries. Next, you learn how to pass your NRQL query to your Newsletter subscriptions per version chart. Step 1 of 7 Change to the add-nrql-components/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nrql-components/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, update the LineChart in NewsletterSignups. Remove the mock data, and use the NRQL query you built in the Data explorer: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. In NrqlQuery, you set two props: accountId: The id for the account you query from query: The query to perform With these, your NR1 app can query the data you want to show in your chart. Tip There is a convenience prop for using NRQL to supply data to your charts, called query. If you'd rather not use the NrqlQuery component, try the query prop instead: <LineChart accountId={<YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID>} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" /> Copy Keep in mind you must still supply the accountId. Step 3 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nrql-components/ab-test. Step 4 of 7 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 7 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 7 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: Newsletter subscriptions by version now shows real data from New Relic's database rather than the mock data you defined before. Notice that your chart pulls data when your application loads, but does not continue pulling data while the application is open. You can fix this by adding another prop. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 7 of 7 Add a pollInterval: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. The pollInterval is the number of milliseconds between chart refreshes. Each time the chart refreshes, it queries fresh data from New Relic. In this case, you refresh every minute. Populate your PieChart with subscription event data Now that you've seen how to passed New Relic data to Newsletter subscriptions per version, it's time to move on to Total subscriptions per version. These two charts are similar in that they compare subscription event data grouped by version. The primary differences between Newsletter subscriptions per version and Total subscriptions per version are: One is a line chart and one is a pie chart One shows timeseries data and one shows all-time totals Step 1 of 2 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js, update the TestDistributions component, removing the mock data and populating the PieChart with the same NRQL query you used for Newsletter subscriptions per version but with different TIMESERIES and SINCE clauses: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, PieChart, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 7 DAYS AGO\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <PieChart data={data} fullWidth /> } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. You don't need the TIMESERIES clause because the pie chart only shows numerical data. You don't need the SINCE clause because Total subscriptions per version needs to show all-time subscription totals. Step 2 of 2 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: Total subscriptions per version now shows all-time subscription totals from both versions of your demo application. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Well done! You've configured some charts to query real subscription data from New Relic's database. Populate charts with pageView event data Consider the remaining charts that still use mock data: Total unsubscriptions per version Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions Version A - Page views Version B - Page views Past tests Some of these charts need to show page view data. Fortunately, your demo application creates a custom event for every page view like it does for subscriptions! Since Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions require data from two sources, ignore these for now and focus on Version A - Page views and Version B - Page views. Step 1 of 2 In page-views.js, remove the mock data from VersionPageViews and use a NrqlQuery component to supply a query: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 2 of 2 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: In these new queries, you fetch pageView custom events instead of subscription events. You also use a WHERE clause to filter to a particular page_version rather than a FACET to group by page_version. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Phew, that's a lot of queries, but your application looks great! You're now showing real data in four charts. Remember the two charts you ignored because they require data from two sources? Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions You have to handle these differently than you did for the charts you've been dealing with because NRQL has no method for querying data from multiple sources. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to supply data to these two charts. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize NRQL data, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { this[index] = { endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, } }, data ) historicalData.data = data return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data, format it according to the TableChart specifications, and set it on historicalData.data. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet.",

Before you build your New Relic One application, you need to spin up your demo services. This coursework depends on two important services: A web service that shows a newsletter signup form. The form's heading text alternates between two versions because you're performing an A/B test to determine which text leads to more high-quality subscriptions. A simulator service that sends steady traffic to the website so that you don't have to manually generate data To spin up your demo services, you first need to install Docker and Docker compose. Spin up your demo services Step 1 of 5 Clone the coursework repository from GitHub: bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course This repository contains code for creating NodeJS New Relic automations. It also contains a an app code directory for each lesson in the course. You'll use these directories to follow along with the course content. Step 2 of 5 Change to the demo directory, called ab-test-app: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/ab-test-app This directory contains configuration files and READMEs for using the demo. Step 3 of 5 Build and run the web service and simulator containers, using docker-compose: bash Copy $ NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=<your New Relic license key> docker-compose up -d Important Make sure you replace <your New Relic license key> with your actual license key. Once it's finished, view the website at localhost:3001: Step 4 of 5 Visit New Relic, and navigate to APM in the top navigation menu. Select Newsletter from the list of instrumented services: You may have to wait a minute or two for New Relic to recieve data from your demo services. Once it's ready, you'll see transaction data, such as performance, throughput, and an Apdex score: Step 5 of 5 To spin down your demo services, run docker-compose down from your ab-test-app directory: bash Copy $ docker-compose down Now you're ready to build your New Relic One application!

      "body": "One way for users to access your Nerdlet is by creating a launcher. The launcher opens a Nerdlet from the Apps page in New Relic. You can also provide access to your Nerdlet from an entity in your account. In this guide, you'll learn how to attach your Nerdlet to your entities. Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install and configure the New Relic One CLI Create a Nerdpack Step 1 of 5 Update your CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 5 Create a Nerdpack with the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name entity-nerdlet This results in a Nerdpack, called entity-nerdlet, which consists of a launcher, called entity-nerdlet-launcher, and a Nerdlet, called entity-nerdlet-nerdlet. Step 3 of 5 Serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ cd entity-nerdlet $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 4 of 5 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and navigate to Apps: ?nerdpacks=local is required to enable your locally served Nerdpacks to load in New Relic. Step 5 of 5 Under Your apps, click your launcher to view your New Relic One application: Attach your Nerdlet to entities You've seen how you can access your Nerdlet from a launcher. Now, access your Nerdlet from your entities. Step 1 of 6 From inside your Nerdpack's root directory, open nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json. This is your Nerdlet's metadata file. You'll use this file to attach your Nerdlet to entities. Step 2 of 6 Add a context object with an entities array: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [] 8 } 9 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy This tells New Relic that you want to surface your Nerdlet in an array of entity contexts. Step 3 of 6 Add an entity context: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [ 8 { 9 \"domain\": \"APM\", 10 \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" 11 } 12 ] 13 } 14 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Here, you've attached your Nerdlet to all application entities in the APM domain. Step 4 of 6 Go to APM: Because you're serving your Nerdpack locally, remember that you must still specify the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 5 of 6 Choose any of your applications: Step 6 of 6 Scroll down to see your Nerdlet attached to the application: Click this menu option and see your Nerdlet the same way you did with the launcher. Configure your entities context The context.entities key in your Nerdlet's nr1.json file specifies which entities your Nerdlet should be attached to. Specify an entity domain Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity domain by specifying the domain as one of the following values: APM: Application Performance Monitoring BROWSER: Browser INFRA: Infrastructure monitoring MOBILE: Mobile monitoring SYNTH: Synthetic monitoring For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities in the APM domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those in a domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"!APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities in multiple domains: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" }] } } Copy Specify an entity type Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity type by specifying the type as one of the following values: APPLICATION HOST MONITOR For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities of the APPLICATION type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those of a specified type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"!APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity whose type matches one of an array of types: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }, { \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }] } } Copy Specify entity tags Attach your Nerdlet to entities that have a given tag. For example, attach your Nerdlet to the entity which has a particular GUID: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"guid\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ENTITY GUID>\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity which has particular accountId and uses the Python programming language: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"accountId\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ACCOUNT ID>\"] }, { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Combine filters When you filter the entities to which your Nerdlet will be added, you can combine domain, type, and tags: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"domain\": \"APM\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\", \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] }, { \"domain\": \"SYNTH\", \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" } ] } } Copy In this example, you've attached your Nerdlet to: All APM applications whose metadata tags specify the python language AND all Synthetic monitors AND all Browser entities",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Install and configure the New Relic One CLI, before starting this one. A Nerdpack is a package that contains all the files that make up a New Relic One application or visualization. Nerdpacks include files for metadata, Nerdlets, assets, and more. To create a Nerdpack, use the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack When nr1 prompts for a component name, use \"ab-test\" and watch the tool create the foundations of your Nerdpack. Once it's finished, explore the files it created for you. Root directory At the root level, you have a directory called ab-test. Everything inside this directory is part of the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls ab-test README.md nerdlets nr1.json package.json launchers node_modules package-lock.json Readme.md provides instructions for creating Nerdpack elements and serving your application locally. This and nr1 --help are useful if you forget how to interact with your Nerdpack using the command line tool. Javascript files package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules are important for running your JavaScript application, but aren't unique to Nerdpacks. You can learn about these modules from JavaScript courses should you need to tweak them. For now, take a look at nr1.json, one of the most relevant files in this directory. Metadata file nr1.json is the Nerdpack's metadata file, containing a schema type, unique identifier, a display name, and a description. Since you’re building a New Relic One application for running and analyzing A/B tests, update the package's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and set the description to \"A/B test your application using New Relic One\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"311bcd0c-f7eb-4285-afed-4219179bf91d\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"A/B test your application using New Relic One.\" } nr1.json Copy It's good to describe your application's purpose, especially if you're going to publish your application for others to use. Next, look at the launchers and nerdlets subdirectories. Launchers launchers is a directory because you can create multiple launchers for your New Relic One application. nr1 create only created one launcher for your Nerdpack and called it \"ab-test-launcher\". Inside its directory, there are two files: icon.png is an image that represents the application nr1.json is the launcher's metadata file Use \"A/B Test Launcher\" for the launcher's displayName and \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\" for the description in nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"ab-test-launcher\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test Launcher\", \"description\": \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\" } launchers/ab-test-launcher/nr1.json Copy Notice that the launcher has a rootNerdletId. This identifies the Nerdlet that the launcher opens when it's selected. This Nerdpack has only one Nerdlet, called ab-test-nerdlet, but some Nerdpacks may have multiple. Make sure that you set the rootNerdletId to the Nerdlet you want the launcher to open. Nerdlets The nerdlets directory contains all the Nerdlets that make up your New Relic One application. Since ab-test-nerdlet is the only Nerdlet in this Nerdpack, there is only one subdirectory. In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, there are three files: index.js is the JavaScript file that contains your Nerdlet component styles.scss holds the Sass stylesheet for your Nerdlet nr1.json contains the Nerdlet's metadata Update your Nerdlet's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and description to \"Control and view results of your A/B test\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"Control and view results of your A/B test\" } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Now, you've customized your Nerdpack, Nerdlet, and launcher with informative display names and descriptions, but what does your application actually do? Check out index.js to see what your default Nerdlet looks like: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, ab-test-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you have AbTestNerdletNerdlet, which nr1 created for you. It's a React component that renders a first-level welcome heading. Because this is the root Nerdlet, as specified in your launcher's nr1.json file, when you click on your launcher in the New Relic platform, the launcher will open a view that displays this heading. Tip In this lesson, you used nr1 create to create a Nerdpack, complete with a launcher and a Nerdlet. If you want to create another Nerdlet or Launcher in your Nerdpack, you can also do that with nr1 create: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdlet $ nr1 create --type launcher You can even skip the --type flag and select an option from a list: bash Copy $ nr1 create ? What kind of component do you want to create? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit. nerdpack ❯ nerdlet - create a/an Nerdlet artifact inside your Nerdpack. launcher catalog visualization In the next lesson, you'll learn how to serve your Nerdpack locally and see your app in action!

Also, at the top of any UI page, select Query your data to access the data explorer and query builder. View a chart's query For some charts, you can view the NRQL query used to generate that chart. This can help you understand a chart better or use it as the basis for a new query. Choose time range Drag across a section of a chart to zoom in on that time range. Or, use the time picker in the top right corner of the UI to select pre-set time ranges or set a custom one. View chart details Mouse over a chart to see a pop-up with more detail. For some charts, selecting a point on the chart will take you to a UI page with more information about that metric. Hide or return chart elements To hide or unhide a displayed chart element, select that element's name below the chart. The chart display will adjust to reflect the absence or presence of that element. Share with teammates Here are some options for sharing New Relic UI pages and visualizations. If you want to... Do this... Share UI pages and dashboards To share an entire New Relic UI page, click Share near the top of the UI to copy the URL. Share charts If New Relic charts are built with NRQL queries, they have a menu that exposes various options, including sharing options like Get as image and Get chart link. Some notes about sharing: The person you share with may not have access to view the data from that account. To solve that, someone on your team with New Relic user management abilities must add that person to the account. If someone can't access a custom dashboard, it may be that it is set to private. Read more about dashboard permissions. Some sharing options have associated time ranges, which may impact later viewings of it. For example, if you use a chart's Get chart link option and that chart is set to 'Last 30 minutes', when viewed it will show the last 30 minutes, not the time range displayed when it was shared. To share a specific time range, you must select that time range in the UI. Smooth navigation: Customize your bar and access the shortcuts Select the edit icon at the right end of the navigation bar to customize your view. Home, Explorer, Browse data, Dashboards, and Alerts & AI are fixed, but you can favorite up to six more elements to display on the bar as well. The rest will go on the More group. Navigation shortcuts are a faster way to find entities and apps that are relevant to you. Mouse over any menu item for quick access to your favorite entities, those you recently visited, or just to search without having to navigate to a specific section. If you click on an entity, you can choose to open it in the same browser tab or in a new one. Adjust account and user settings To adjust account settings and user preferences, and to get support and docs links, use the account dropdown, located at the top right of the UI, beside your user name.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add chart headings, before starting this one. With your charts organized and descriptive headings above each one, your New Relic One application is becoming more usable. In this lesson, you'll continue that trend by creating descriptions for each design version in your A/B test. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-version-descriptions/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-version-descriptions/ab-test Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named description.js: bash Copy $ touch description.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a new React component, called VersionDescription, which uses a HeadingText and a BlockText to render a version description that you pass, using the description prop: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, HeadingText } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionDescription extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return ( <div> <HeadingText className=\"versionHeader\"> Version {this.props.version} </HeadingText> <BlockText className=\"versionText\"> {this.props.description} </BlockText> </div> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/description.js Copy You'll use this one class to create a version description for each design version in your A/B test. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import VersionDescription, create descriptions for each design version, and create a new GridItem component for each design version: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you've created two VersionDescription components. You passed the description and version props, which correspond to a design version. You also added a horizontal rule to visually separate the descriptions from the charts in your app. For this, you added a GridItem with a columnSpan of 12, to stretch the rule the full width of the grid. Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-version-descriptions/ab-test. Step 6 of 8 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account.

Now, you've added descriptions for your competing designs and your charts. In the next lesson, you’ll create a new section of your application from user interface components.

Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Select a deployment option No matter which option you use to deploy browser monitoring, the end result is to inject the browser agent's JavaScript snippet into your pages for browser monitoring. The method you select depends on your preferences and business needs. To view the procedure to install and enable the browser agent, click the link for the option you want to use. You can also use the Browser Application settings page to update settings. Important The following configuration options refer only to the browser monitoring agent. These are not the same as the New Relic user roles and editions. Browser deployment option Description Use the APM agent to inject the JavaScript You can use an APM agent to automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript snippet for you. This is the easiest way to install the agent for an app that already is being monitored by APM. (APM-monitored apps are listed on your APM Applications index.) Paste the JavaScript snippet into a webpage This allows you to control the exact placement of the JavaScript into your app's webpage(s) by copying and pasting the browser agent's JavaScript snippet. This is useful for: Standalone apps, static sites, and cached pages delivered by CDN APM apps that are not as closely coupled to the browser app as with a standard server-side app (for example, when your client-side app talks to a REST API back end) Enable single-page app (SPA) monitoring Enabling SPA requires a Pro + SPA browser agent subscription, and you may need to re-deploy the browser JavaScript agent. Use the REST API The REST API lets you manage deployment outside the browser UI. This is useful for large organizations deploying multiple apps. Use an APM agent API to manually instrument the JavaScript snippet For apps that are monitored by APM, you can use the APM agent's API to inject the JavaScript manually instead of automatically. Enable an APM-monitored app Use this procedure to automatically deploy the browser agent on an app that is monitored by APM: Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Enable via New Relic APM. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Select your application section, type or use the search window to find an app's name. Click Enable. Important Node.js: To finish enabling the browser agent for a Node.js app, follow the additional procedure to insert the JavaScript header into the beginning of your HTML page's head tag. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. Enable with copy/paste Use this procedure to insert browser's JavaScript snippet for browser monitoring into your app's webpages yourself. This option is useful for monitoring static sites (such as Jekyll) or cached pages delivered by CDN. Tip Near the bottom of the generated JavaScript is your browser license key and application ID. This is useful with the REST API and API Explorer. Go to one.newrelic.com, select Browser, and then select Add more data. In the Back-end, front-end, and mobile applications section, select the New Relic Browser tile. When prompted to select the account you want to add this instrumentation to, choose your account, and click Continue. From the Get started with New Relic browser page, in the Choose a deployment method section, select Copy/Paste JavaScript Code. In the Choose your instrumentation section, select the type of agent: Lite, Pro, or Pro + SPA. In the Configure your instrumentation section, make the selections you want. In the Name your app section, name your app: If your app is monitored by APM, select Yes, then type or use the search window to find the app's name. If you have a standalone app for Browser (not monitored by APM), select No, then type the app's name. Click Enable. A new section, Instrument the agent, opens on the page with JavaScript code for your project. Copy the code snippet, then paste it inline into your pages as close to the top of the <head> element as possible, but after any position-sensitive <meta> tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). For more information on the inline head placement, see JavaScript placement requirements. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes for Browser to start collecting data, then select your app from the Browser applications index. If you use the copy/paste method, but don't finish the setup process, you can still view and copy the generated JavaScript snippet from your app's Browser Application settings page or by using the REST API (v2). Instrument webpages using the APM agent This information applies to apps that are also monitored by APM. New Relic's agents can instrument webpages with the required JavaScript for page load timing. If you use the APM agent to add the JavaScript snippet to your webpages, insert the instrumentation snippet as close to the top as possible. This allows you to take advantage of detailed information about browser's AJAX calls and JavaScript errors. For more information, see the instructions for your APM agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Troubleshoot browser agent installation When you enable browser Pro features for session traces, AJAX calls, or JavaScript errors, it may take approximately five minutes before information becomes available. If you have problems with your browser installation or if no data appears after five minutes, refer to the troubleshooting tips, and restart your agent.",

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. One of those options is adding the Java agent API's @Trace, @TraceLambda or @TraceByReturnType annotations to your application code. This document describes how to use annotations. Important To use annotations, you must modify the source code. If you can't or don't want to modify your source code, see Custom instrumentation for other instrumentation options. Configure your agent for annotations By default, the configuration setting enable_custom_tracing is set to true in the Java agent, which is the setting required for @Trace annotations to function. This setting is not included in the newrelic.yml by default. The only time you need to incorporate this setting into your configuration file is if you want to disable @Trace annotations altogether. To do this, set enable_custom_tracing: false (prefaced with two spaces) in the common stanza of your newrelic.yml. Make sure that newrelic-api.jar appears in your classpath as it contains all these annotations. @Trace Annotating a method with @Trace tells the Java agent that measurements should be taken for that method. To add a method call as a custom trace add @Trace annotations to your method. import com.newrelic.api.agent.Trace; ... @Trace public void run() { // background task } Copy Create a new transaction If transactions do not appear and you want to start a new transaction, include dispatcher=true with the @Trace annotation: @Trace (dispatcher=true) public void run() { // background task } Copy Add detail to your transactions If your transaction traces show large blocks of uninstrumented time and you want to include some more methods within the trace, you can use the @Trace annotation without parameters: @Trace protected void methodWithinTransaction() { // work } Copy Convert a transaction to a web request To make a background task report as a web browser transaction with a Java agent API call: In the method annotated with @Trace(dispatcher=true), call: NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(Request request, Response response) Copy The arguments are implementations of the Request and Response interfaces in newrelic-api.jar. Important Even if your Request and Response objects already are present, you still need to add this API call. Define your own @Trace annotation class If you define your own @Trace annotation class, there is no dependency on the newrelic-api.jar. To define the class: package com.test; @Target(ElementType.METHOD) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) public @interface Trace { public static final String NULL = \"\"; String metricName() default NULL; boolean dispatcher() default false; String tracerFactoryName() default NULL; } Copy Then, configure the agent to use this annotation in the common section of the newrelic.yml: class_transformer: trace_annotation_class_name: com.test.Trace Copy Properties for @Trace The @Trace annotation supports the following properties. dispatcher Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent will start a transaction when it reaches a method with this @Trace annotation if a transaction is not already in progress. If a transaction is already in progress, the method with this annotation will be included in the ongoing transaction, rather than starting a new one. If false (default), no metrics will be recorded if the agent has not started a transaction before the @Trace annotation is reached. For example: @Trace(dispatcher=true) Copy async Type: Boolean Default: false If true, this method is marked as asynchronous and the agent will trace this method if it linked to an existing transaction. For example: @Trace(async=true) Copy If false (default), the method is not marked as asynchronous. If other @Trace annotations are present and the method is not executing asynchronously, it will still be traced. metricName Type: String Default: (none) This property affects transaction traces and error reporting. By default, the metric name will include the class name followed by the method name. If you do not want class followed by method, then you can use this property to change the metric name. If you set the metricName, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\"), then the time spent in this method will appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. If you set the metricName in addition to the dispatcher, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\", dispatcher=true), then the transaction name will appear as YourMessageHere in the APM Transactions page but the time spent in this method will not appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. Here is an example: @Trace(metricName=\"YourMetricName\") Copy Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. excludeFromTransactionTrace Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the method will be excluded from the transaction trace. The agent will still collect metrics for the method. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true) Copy leaf Type: Boolean Default: false A leaf tracer has no child tracers. This is useful when you want all time attributed to the tracer, even if other trace points are encountered the tracer's execution. Database tracers often act as a leaf so that all time is attributed to database activity, even if instrumented external calls are made. Here is an example: @Trace(leaf=true) Copy If a leaf tracer does not participate in transaction traces, the agent can create a tracer with lower overhead. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true, leaf=true) Copy @TraceLambda If your transaction traces show large blocks of uninstrumented time and you want to include lambda expressions within the trace, you can use the @TraceLambda annotation without parameters: import com.newrelic.api.agent.TraceLambda; @TraceLambda class ClassContainingLambdaExpressions() { // work } Copy Lambda expressions become static methods of the containing class after compilation. By default, static methods within classes marked with the @TraceLambda annotation matching the annotations pattern will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Properties for @TraceLambda The @TraceLambda annotation supports the following properties. pattern Type: String Default: ^\\$?(lambda\\|anonfun)\\$(?\\<name\\>.*) If you set the pattern, as in @TraceLambda(pattern=\"YourPattern\"), then the marked classes method names will be matched against the regex pattern YourPattern. If matched the related method will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Here is an example: @TraceLambda(pattern=\"YourPattern\") Copy includeNonstatic Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the marked classes nonstatic methods will be eligible for assessment against the pattern for instrumentation. Here is an example: @TraceLambda(includeNonstatic=\"true\") Copy @TraceByReturnType To include methods with a particular return type within the trace, you can use the @TraceByReturnType annotation to mark a class passing the return types as a property. Methods in annotated classes that match one of the specified return types will be marked with the @Trace annotation. @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={Integer.class, String.class}) class ClassContainingMethods() { // ... } Copy Properties for @TraceByReturnType The @TraceByReturnType annotation supports the following properties. traceReturnTypes Type: List < Class> Default: empty list If you set the traceReturnTypes, as in @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={String.class}), then the marked classes method return types will be matched against the String.class. All matched methods will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Here is an example: @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={Integer.class, String.class}) class ClassContainingMethods() { public String doSomething() { // matches // ... } public Long somethingElse() { // does not match // ... } } Copy Performance considerations When the Java agent is present in the JVM, it will inject code on the annotated methods. The performance hit is negligible in heavyweight operations, such as database or webservice calls, but is noticeable in methods that are called frequently, such as an accessor called thousands of times a second. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to decreased performance and to a metric grouping issue.

      "body": "Our StatsD integration lets you easily get StatsD-format data into New Relic. You can also add any arbitrary tags (key-value pairs) to your data. Once your metrics are in New Relic, you can query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Requirements This integration uses our Metric API and our Event API to ingest data. To use these APIs, you'll need an Insert API key. The integration adheres to the Metric API requirements and data limits. The default rate limit is 100,000 data points per minute (DPM). If you think you're missing metrics or sending more than 100K DPM, see Request data changes. To see if your account is hitting the rate limit, run the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' FACET category, message LIMIT 100 since 1 day ago Copy Install This section will explain how to do a standard install. If you want to run StatsD in Kubernetes, see Kubernetes install. To install the StatsD integration, run the following command and include your New Relic account ID and New Relic Insert API key. This generates a TOML configuration file used by gostatsd. docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy If your account is in the EU data center region, add this to the above command: -e NR_EU_REGION=true \\ Copy After installing, you can: Do optional additional configuration Define your metrics Add custom tags to your data Create alerts Install for Kubernetes Here are examples of Kubernetes manifests for deployment and service objects: Kubernetes manifest examples Below are examples of Kubernetes manifests to deploy StatsD in a Kubernetes environment and create a StatsD service named newrelic-statsd. You need to insert your account ID and your license key. deployment.yml: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: selector: matchLabels: app: newrelic-statsd replicas: 2 revisionHistoryLimit: 2 template: metadata: labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: containers: - name: newrelic-statsd image: newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 env: - name: NR_ACCOUNT_ID value: \"NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID\" - name: NR_API_KEY value: \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy service.yml: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: newrelic-statsd port: 80 targetPort: 8125 protocol: UDP selector: app: newrelic-statsd Copy For configuration details, see Kubernetes configuration. Configure In the install procedure, you run nri-statsd with environment variables, and this generates a TOML configuration file. Additionally, you can set these configuration options: Configuration options Description expiry-interval string If a metric is not updated for this amount of time, we stop reporting that metric. Default is 5m. If you want to send the metrics only if the value was updated between the flush intervals, configure this to 1ms. To never expire metrics, set it to 0. percent-threshold list of integers Specifies the percentiles used for metrics aggregation. Default: 90. metrics-addr string Indicates address on which to listen for metrics. Default: :8125. Tip To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the StatsD integration you must define the following endpoints in the custom configuration: address = 'https://gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/ $NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' Copy address-metrics = 'https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' Copy Here are some examples of customizing configuration by overwriting the default configuration: Example of custom configuration # Specify after how long do we expire metrics, default:5m expiry-interval = '1ms' # percent-threshold specify a list of percentiles for metrics aggregation, default:90 percent-threshold = [90, 99] backends='newrelic' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy Disable timer sub-metrics: By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. If you want to disable those metrics you can do it by adding a disabled-sub-metrics configuration section and set true for the ones you want disabled. Here's an example: # disabled-sub-metrics configuration section allows disabling timer sub-metrics [disabled-sub-metrics] # Regular metrics count=false count-per-second=false mean=false median=false lower=false upper=false stddev=false sum=false sum-squares=false # Percentile metrics count-pct=false mean-pct=false sum-pct=false sum-squares-pct=false lower-pct=false upper-pct=false Copy Docker: overwrite default configuration To overwrite the default nri-statsd configuration while running in a container, you can mount a configuration file inside the container. You can adopt the following template as needed for your situation. Example: backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To run the container with the file mounted in the appropriate path: docker run \\ ... -v ${PWD}/nri-statsd.toml:/etc/opt/newrelic/nri-statsd.toml \\ ... newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Kubernetes: overwrite default configuration The best approach to configure nri-statsd running in Kubernetes is to use a configMap and mount the configMap into the container. (This is a similar process to mounting the configuration file in Docker.) Example: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-statsd-config namespace: default data: nri-statsd.toml: | backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = '$NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To use the configMap, declare a volume on your deployment spec template and then declare a volumeMount on your container spec. Example: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment spec: template: spec: containers: .... volumeMounts: - mountPath: /etc/opt/newrelic/ name: nri-statsd-config volumes: - name: nri-statsd-config configMap: name: nri-statsd-config Copy Metric format The integration receives metrics using the StatsD protocol. Optionally, the sample rate can be configured and tags can be added. Here's the metric data format we use: <metric name>:<value>|<type>|@<sample rate>|#<tags> Copy Here are explanations of these fields: Field name Description < metric name> string Required. Name of the metric. < value> string Required. The metric type: c = counter g = gauge ms = timer @ < sample rate> float Optional for simple counters or timer counters. When many metrics must be sent, you can use sampling to reduce network traffic. The downside is a reduction in the resolution of the data. An example of how this would work for sample rates below 1: If you set this to 0.1, the counter would send a measurement one out of every 10 times. # < tags> string Optional. Tags attached to your metrics are converted into attributes (key-value pairs). For more on tagging options, see Tags. Metric types Here are the types of metrics and how to format them: Counter A counter measures the number of occurrences of an event. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. A counter can be incremented or decremented during the same flush interval by adding a sign to the value. In the following example, the counter value will be 2: counter:4|c counter:-2|c Copy At each flush, the current count is sent and reset to 0. If the count is not updated, at the next flush it will send the value 0. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Here’s an example of a counter that is being sampled 1 out of 10 times: counter:4|c@0.1 Copy Gauge A gauge represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include temperature, CPU usage, and memory. Here's an example: temperature:40|g Copy If the gauge is not updated, at the next flush it will send the previous value. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Timer The timer metric type measures timing data. By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. These are sent as sub-metrics in the following format: <metric_base_name>.std_dev <metric_base_name>.median <metric_base_name>.summary <metric_base_name>.sum_squares <metric_base_name>.mean <metric_base_name>.per_second Copy The configured percentiles will generate the following metrics. The percentile threshold value will be attached as a tag. <metric_base_name>.sum_squares.percentiles <metric_base_name>.sum.percentiles <metric_base_name>.count.percentiles <metric_base_name>.upper.percentiles <metric_base_name>.mean.percentiles Copy The percentile threshold can be tweaked with the percent-threshold config option. These can be controlled through the disabled-sub-metrics configuration section. Add tags (attributes) You can add tags to your data, which we save as attributes (key-value pairs). There are two options for adding tags: Add default tags that apply to all metrics: These apply to all metrics. They are fixed and don't change over time. Add metric-level tags: These apply to specific metrics and allow the value to be changed between two submits. Add default tags that apply to all metrics Add tags to metrics and events by defining an environment variable in the startup command. Here's an example that would create two tags: -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" Copy Here's that environment variable used in the startup command: docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Add metric-level tags When defining the metric format, you can add tags using this format: <bucket name>:<value>|<type>|#<tags> Copy In this example, <tags> is a comma-separated list of tags. Tags format is: simple or key:value. Here's an example NRQL query that includes a custom tag: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE environment = 'production' Copy Create alerts You can alert on StatsD data using NRQL alert conditions. Alert example This procedure walks you through sending some sample data and then creating an alert condition using that data. First, send this data to New Relic’s StatsD container: echo \"prod.test.num:32|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Next, create a NRQL alert condition using this query: SELECT latest(prod.test.num) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'prod.test.num' Copy Here's an image showing creating this NRQL alert condition. Notice that the sample data sent in is represented by the blue dot on the upper right of the chart. Now we can create the alert condition with these settings: When you create the NRQL alert condition, be sure to set the Condition name. If a metric with a value above 50 is sent, then an incident is created and notified. The incident is closed automatically after 24 hours. To test that the alert is working, run this command: echo \"prod.test.num:60|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Find and use data To query your data, you'd use any New Relic query option. For example, you might run a NRQL query like: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'myMetric' and environment = 'production' Copy For more on how to query the Metric data type, see Query metric data. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add your first chart, before starting this one. You’ve begun building your A/B test application. So far, it consists of a single line chart, which represents the number of subscriptions your newsletter receives from each version of your website. To understand what you’ll build in this lesson, review the design guide to remember what charts come next: In the design, there are two pie charts beneath the line chart that you’ve already created. One represents the distribution of users who receive version A and version B. The other represents the distribution of successful requests from users who got version A and version B. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-pie-charts/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add two new Javascript files: total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js bash Copy $ touch total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js Step 3 of 9 In total-subscriptions.js, create a component, called TotalSubscriptions, which renders mocked subscription data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Notice that the series data is formatted differently for PieChart than it was for LineChart. Because PieChart uses unidimensional data, its series only take y-values. Step 4 of 9 In total-cancellations.js, create a component, called TotalCancellations, which renders mocked cancellation data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new components and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the PieChart components displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Your application is starting to take shape. You’ve created a line chart and two pie charts. For now, these charts use mocked data, but you’ll provide them real data in a later lesson. Before you focus on the data in your charts, however, you’ll learn how to add a table to your application so you can visualize data in a new way.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add tables, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you added a variety of charts to your A/B test application. These charts presented different facets of information about your A/B test, and they behaved independently from one other. In this lesson, you’ll create a new pair of line charts and learn how to synchronize their behaviors. Before you write any new code, consult your design guide to understand the role that these new charts will play in your application: In the design guide, there is a line graph under each of the tables you created in the last lesson. These line graphs show the version-specific response times for newsletter signup requests. Now, you’ll build two more line charts, but this time, you’ll group them with a ChartGroup and specify that their values are measured in milliseconds. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-a-chart-group/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named page-views.js: bash Copy $ touch page-views.js Step 3 of 9 In this new file, create a component called VersionPageViews to hold a LineChart, which shows the number of times a page is viewed: import React from 'react'; import { LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Notice the new attribute in the series' metadata fields: units_data. This attribute describes the unit type for a specified data axis. In this case, you set the unit type for the y axis to 'MS', which stands for milliseconds. Other options for unit types, include: 'PERCENTAGE', 'TIMESTAMP', and 'BYTES_PER_SECOND'. Step 4 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In index.js, import ChartGroup from nr1 and group your VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <ChartGroup> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </ChartGroup> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Because the tables are conceptually related, as they show contrasting performance metrics over the same timeslice, it makes sense to group them in a ChartGroup. This means that the two charts behave synchronously. For example, when you hover over one chart, the other chart shows a hover indicator at the same x coordinate. Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the LineChart components synchronized in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Tip Each of the chart component types you've used in this lesson have had different series configurations. Most chart components share the same metadata attributes, like LineChart and PieChart, but differ in their data formats. It's helpful to be aware of the different data formats, for when you create your own charts. You can read more about the data formats in the chart component documentation. Now your application is filled with charts, but it doesn't look great. The charts are stacked on top of one another in an unhelpful way. In the next lesson, you'll learn about the user interface components from the SDK and how you can use them to organize your charts.

      "body": "Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account and Node.js installed on your machine. See Setting up your development environment for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git $ cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application. Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID $ npm install # Install dependencies $ nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, you should see a Create a table launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet subdirectory and open the index.js file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component. Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows. As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells. The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done!

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User. For more information on the various NerdStorage components, please visit the New Relic developer website API documentation.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the New Relic One catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published to the catalog, you can view it by visiting the Apps page of New Relic: From the catalog UI, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top right of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app in the catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add navigation to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you finished the A/B test application you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to prepare it for publication. When you publish your app to the New Relic One catalog, users can view it and subscribe to it. You can help your users by showing and telling them what the app does, how to use it, and more. Create catalog information To supply information to the catalog about your app, you need to create the catalog directory in your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 6 Change to the describe-app/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test Step 2 of 6 Create the catalog directory: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog This creates a catalog directory with template files for inputting custom information about your app. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog directory. Step 3 of 6 Update catalog/documentation.md: ## Documentation This application combines and presents data from New Relic and the Nerdsletter API so that we can make an informed decision on which design version results in more high-quality newsletter subscriptions. It also presents an button to end the test, which saves the date and version descriptions in local storage. We can use this app for future A/B tests as well! catalog/documentation.md Copy For this course, you're keeping the documentation concise by merely describing what the app does. In your own projects, you might also include instructions for contributing to the project in an open source context, installing the app's dependencies, or anything else that might help a user navigate complexities in your app or code. Step 4 of 6 Update catalog/config.json: { \"tagline\": \"Win @ newsletter subscriptions\", \"details\": \"Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course\", \"whatsNew\": \"Initial release! Includes:\\n- A variety of charts for understanding the test results\\n- An end test button for storing some test data in a table\", \"support\": { \"email\": { \"address\": \"\" }, \"issues\": { \"url\": \"\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"\" } } } catalog/config.json Copy Here, you've specified a tagline, project details, the source code repository, and a short list of everything included in the initial release. In other projects, you might also add a support email or support links. Step 5 of 6 Save the this screenshot to your catalog/screenshots directory. Users will be able to see a carousel of screenshots in your app's About page in the catalog. Step 6 of 6 Save the following icon as icon.png in two places: nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test/launchers/ab-test-launcher This will act as the launcher's icon and the app's catalog icon on the About page. Now you've added documentation, screenshots, metadata, and an icon to your app so that users will be able to understand what it does and why they might need it. For now, these files are all local and they need to be submitted to the catalog. But before you can do that, your app, itself, needs to be published to the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll publish your app, submit your catalog information, and view the results in New Relic.

Search accounts and entities Access Quick find clicking the button at the top right corner of the New Relic One UI. Some details about your search: You can search across all your New Relic accounts with cross-account access. Entities that cease to exist are available in search for eight days. If your organization has multiple accounts, use the account picker at the top left corner to select accounts. Use chart and query features You can add most charts to a new or existing dashboard. Here are some query and chart features available across all or most of the platform: If you want to... Do this... Start querying your data Mouse over Browse data and select metrics, events, logs, or traces for a direct access to any of those types of data. Also, at the top of any UI page, select Query your data to access the data explorer and query builder. View a chart's query For some charts, you can view the NRQL query used to generate that chart. This can help you understand a chart better or use it as the basis for a new query. Choose time range Drag across a section of a chart to zoom in on that time range. Or, use the time picker in the top right corner of the UI to select pre-set time ranges or set a custom one. View chart details Mouse over a chart to see a pop-up with more detail. For some charts, selecting a point on the chart will take you to a UI page with more information about that metric. Hide or return chart elements To hide or unhide a displayed chart element, select that element's name below the chart. The chart display will adjust to reflect the absence or presence of that element. Share with teammates Here are some options for sharing New Relic UI pages and visualizations. If you want to... Do this... Share UI pages and dashboards To share an entire New Relic UI page, click Share near the top of the UI to copy the URL. Share charts If New Relic charts are built with NRQL queries, they have a menu that exposes various options, including sharing options like Get as image and Get chart link. Some notes about sharing: The person you share with may not have access to view the data from that account. To solve that, someone on your team with New Relic user management abilities must add that person to the account. If someone can't access a custom dashboard, it may be that it is set to private. Read more about dashboard permissions. Some sharing options have associated time ranges, which may impact later viewings of it. For example, if you use a chart's Get chart link option and that chart is set to 'Last 30 minutes', when viewed it will show the last 30 minutes, not the time range displayed when it was shared. To share a specific time range, you must select that time range in the UI. Smooth navigation: Customize your bar and access the shortcuts Select the edit icon at the right end of the navigation bar to customize your view. Home, Explorer, Browse data, Dashboards, and Alerts & AI are fixed, but you can favorite up to six more elements to display on the bar as well. The rest will go on the More group. Navigation shortcuts are a faster way to find entities and apps that are relevant to you. Mouse over any menu item for quick access to your favorite entities, those you recently visited, or just to search without having to navigate to a specific section. If you click on an entity, you can choose to open it in the same browser tab or in a new one.

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced query builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating browser, mobile, and synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's query builder or the GraphQL API. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use query builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the New Relic One catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in the catalog Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the New Relic One app catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Apps: From here, you can see your application under New Relic One catalog: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots... ✔ Screenshots uploaded ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

Step 3 of 3 View your app in the catalog: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public New Relic One catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Subscribe to your New Relic One application.",

Step 2 of 10 In newsletter-signups.js, create a new method, called NewsletterSignups.openApmEntity(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. This method uses navigation.openStackedEntity() to display your demo application's APM entity in a stacked view. Notice openApmEntity() requires your ENTITY_GUID. You need to locate that ID and store it in a constant. Step 3 of 10 Navigate to APM: See metadata for your Newsletter service: Copy the entity's GUID: Create an ENTITY_GUID constant: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and the entity GUID you just copied, respectively. Now, openApmEntity() knows what entity to show. Next, you need to create a button to invoke this method. Step 4 of 10 Create a button to show your APM entity: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you've created a button and configured it to call openApmEntity() when it's clicked. Step 5 of 10 Import Stack and StackItem: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. You'll use Stack and StackItem to lay out the button on the far right side of the same row that the HeadingText is on. Step 6 of 10 Lay out the Stack: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <Stack fullWidth> <StackItem grow={true}> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> </StackItem> <StackItem> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> </StackItem> </Stack> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you used a full-width Stack to set up the layout for the row. To make the HeadingText fill the entire row except the width of the button, you used the StackItem.grow prop. Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. Click App performance: Now you see the stacked entity: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively Congratulations! You're finished writing all the code you'll write for your New Relic One A/B test application. Now, you have an application reporting New Relic data from your demo service that is running an A/B test. You've created several charts, buttons, and other UI elements. And you've organized your components into a readable and usable view. On top of the visuals, you've supplied data to your charts from multiple data sources in and outside of New Relic. You've created some backend functionality which utilizes your New Relic One application's own data store. You've also utilized the platform APIs for interacting with platform UI and showing a stacked entity view. You've really accomplished a lot throughout this course, so far. There are only a few things left to do! First, is to learn how to publish and subscribe to your New Relic One application so that it can run on our platform instead of your own local server. Second, is to learn how to deal with some common issues you might see in New Relic One application development.

      "body": "New Relic One has some basic UI functions that are widely available across the platform. Understanding these features will help you find and analyze your data more easily. Observe your platform New Relic One gives you full access to the data from all the entities in your stack. Go to the New Relic Explorer at one.newrelic.com to see a full list of entities, identify overall behaviors, filter them to locate sources of performance issues, or plan improvements for your system. Search accounts and entities Access Quick find clicking the button at the top right corner of the New Relic One UI. Some details about your search: You can search across all your New Relic accounts with cross-account access. Entities that cease to exist are available in search for eight days. If your organization has multiple accounts, use the account picker at the top left corner to select accounts. Use chart and query features You can add most charts to a new or existing dashboard. Here are some query and chart features available across all or most of the platform: If you want to... Do this... Start querying your data Mouse over Browse data and select metrics, events, logs, or traces for a direct access to any of those types of data. Also, at the top of any UI page, select Query your data to access the data explorer and query builder. View a chart's query For some charts, you can view the NRQL query used to generate that chart. This can help you understand a chart better or use it as the basis for a new query. Choose time range Drag across a section of a chart to zoom in on that time range. Or, use the time picker in the top right corner of the UI to select pre-set time ranges or set a custom one. View chart details Mouse over a chart to see a pop-up with more detail. For some charts, selecting a point on the chart will take you to a UI page with more information about that metric. Hide or return chart elements To hide or unhide a displayed chart element, select that element's name below the chart. The chart display will adjust to reflect the absence or presence of that element. Share with teammates Here are some options for sharing New Relic UI pages and visualizations. If you want to... Do this... Share UI pages and dashboards To share an entire New Relic UI page, click Share near the top of the UI to copy the URL. Share charts If New Relic charts are built with NRQL queries, they have a menu that exposes various options, including sharing options like Get as image and Get chart link. Some notes about sharing: The person you share with may not have access to view the data from that account. To solve that, someone on your team with New Relic user management abilities must add that person to the account. If someone can't access a custom dashboard, it may be that it is set to private. Read more about dashboard permissions. Some sharing options have associated time ranges, which may impact later viewings of it. For example, if you use a chart's Get chart link option and that chart is set to 'Last 30 minutes', when viewed it will show the last 30 minutes, not the time range displayed when it was shared. To share a specific time range, you must select that time range in the UI. Smooth navigation: Customize your bar and access the shortcuts Select the edit icon at the right end of the navigation bar to customize your view. Home, Explorer, Browse data, Dashboards, and Alerts & AI are fixed, but you can favorite up to six more elements to display on the bar as well. The rest will go on the More group. Navigation shortcuts are a faster way to find entities and apps that are relevant to you. Mouse over any menu item for quick access to your favorite entities, those you recently visited, or just to search without having to navigate to a specific section. If you click on an entity, you can choose to open it in the same browser tab or in a new one. Adjust account and user settings To adjust account settings and user preferences, and to get support and docs links, use the account dropdown, located at the top right of the UI, beside your user name.",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced query builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating browser, mobile, and synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's query builder or the GraphQL API. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use query builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

The New Relic One application that you're building throughout this course allows developers to A/B test their websites. To run a successful A/B test, site owners need to be able to analyze the results. Without knowing how each design performs, how will developers determine which design to use? Here is a mockup for the A/B test application you're building: Your application displays data for two competing versions. With various charts and tables, your users will be able to analyze the results of their test and make informed decisions on which design will work best to achieve their goals. You’ll refer back to this mockup many times throughout this course. It shows you what charts to create, how to organize them, and what kind of data to provide them. In the next four sections, you learn how to create every chart that your A/B test application needs to operate effectively. After that, you’ll arrange the charts to match the mockup’s design and supply New Relic data collected from the demo applications you spun up earlier.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Install and configure the New Relic One CLI, before starting this one. A Nerdpack is a package that contains all the files that make up a New Relic One application or visualization. Nerdpacks include files for metadata, Nerdlets, assets, and more. To create a Nerdpack, use the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack When nr1 prompts for a component name, use \"ab-test\" and watch the tool create the foundations of your Nerdpack. Once it's finished, explore the files it created for you. Root directory At the root level, you have a directory called ab-test. Everything inside this directory is part of the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls ab-test README.md nerdlets nr1.json package.json launchers node_modules package-lock.json Readme.md provides instructions for creating Nerdpack elements and serving your application locally. This and nr1 --help are useful if you forget how to interact with your Nerdpack using the command line tool. Javascript files package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules are important for running your JavaScript application, but aren't unique to Nerdpacks. You can learn about these modules from JavaScript courses should you need to tweak them. For now, take a look at nr1.json, one of the most relevant files in this directory. Metadata file nr1.json is the Nerdpack's metadata file, containing a schema type, unique identifier, a display name, and a description. Since you’re building a New Relic One application for running and analyzing A/B tests, update the package's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and set the description to \"A/B test your application using New Relic One\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"311bcd0c-f7eb-4285-afed-4219179bf91d\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"A/B test your application using New Relic One.\" } nr1.json Copy It's good to describe your application's purpose, especially if you're going to publish your application for others to use. Next, look at the launchers and nerdlets subdirectories. Launchers launchers is a directory because you can create multiple launchers for your New Relic One application. nr1 create only created one launcher for your Nerdpack and called it \"ab-test-launcher\". Inside its directory, there are two files: icon.png is an image that represents the application nr1.json is the launcher's metadata file Use \"A/B Test Launcher\" for the launcher's displayName and \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\" for the description in nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"ab-test-launcher\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test Launcher\", \"description\": \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\" } launchers/ab-test-launcher/nr1.json Copy Notice that the launcher has a rootNerdletId. This identifies the Nerdlet that the launcher opens when it's selected. This Nerdpack has only one Nerdlet, called ab-test-nerdlet, but some Nerdpacks may have multiple. Make sure that you set the rootNerdletId to the Nerdlet you want the launcher to open. Nerdlets The nerdlets directory contains all the Nerdlets that make up your New Relic One application. Since ab-test-nerdlet is the only Nerdlet in this Nerdpack, there is only one subdirectory. In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, there are three files: index.js is the JavaScript file that contains your Nerdlet component styles.scss holds the Sass stylesheet for your Nerdlet nr1.json contains the Nerdlet's metadata Update your Nerdlet's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and description to \"Control and view results of your A/B test\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"Control and view results of your A/B test\" } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Now, you've customized your Nerdpack, Nerdlet, and launcher with informative display names and descriptions, but what does your application actually do? Check out index.js to see what your default Nerdlet looks like: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, ab-test-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you have AbTestNerdletNerdlet, which nr1 created for you. It's a React component that renders a first-level welcome heading. Because this is the root Nerdlet, as specified in your launcher's nr1.json file, when you click on your launcher in the New Relic platform, the launcher will open a view that displays this heading. Tip In this lesson, you used nr1 create to create a Nerdpack, complete with a launcher and a Nerdlet. If you want to create another Nerdlet or Launcher in your Nerdpack, you can also do that with nr1 create: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdlet $ nr1 create --type launcher You can even skip the --type flag and select an option from a list: bash Copy $ nr1 create ?

Start querying your data Mouse over Browse data and select metrics, events, logs, or traces for a direct access to any of those types of data. Also, at the top of any UI page, select Query your data to access the data explorer and query builder. View a chart's query For some charts, you can view the NRQL query used to generate that chart. This can help you understand a chart better or use it as the basis for a new query. Choose time range Drag across a section of a chart to zoom in on that time range. Or, use the time picker in the top right corner of the UI to select pre-set time ranges or set a custom one. View chart details Mouse over a chart to see a pop-up with more detail. For some charts, selecting a point on the chart will take you to a UI page with more information about that metric. Hide or return chart elements To hide or unhide a displayed chart element, select that element's name below the chart. The chart display will adjust to reflect the absence or presence of that element. Share with teammates Here are some options for sharing New Relic UI pages and visualizations. If you want to... Do this... Share UI pages and dashboards To share an entire New Relic UI page, click Share near the top of the UI to copy the URL. Share charts If New Relic charts are built with NRQL queries, they have a menu that exposes various options, including sharing options like Get as image and Get chart link. Some notes about sharing: The person you share with may not have access to view the data from that account. To solve that, someone on your team with New Relic user management abilities must add that person to the account. If someone can't access a custom dashboard, it may be that it is set to private. Read more about dashboard permissions. Some sharing options have associated time ranges, which may impact later viewings of it. For example, if you use a chart's Get chart link option and that chart is set to 'Last 30 minutes', when viewed it will show the last 30 minutes, not the time range displayed when it was shared. To share a specific time range, you must select that time range in the UI. Smooth navigation: Customize your bar and access the shortcuts Select the edit icon at the right end of the navigation bar to customize your view. Home, Explorer, Browse data, Dashboards, and Alerts & AI are fixed, but you can favorite up to six more elements to display on the bar as well. The rest will go on the More group. Navigation shortcuts are a faster way to find entities and apps that are relevant to you. Mouse over any menu item for quick access to your favorite entities, those you recently visited, or just to search without having to navigate to a specific section. If you click on an entity, you can choose to open it in the same browser tab or in a new one.

Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced query builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating browser, mobile, and synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's query builder or the GraphQL API. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use query builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "When you create a dashboard, you add a variety of charts to visualize your New Relic telemetry data. These charts, offered out-of-the-box, are customizable in that you can: Resize and arrange their positions in your dashboard Update their names, display options, and underlying data queries But sometimes the charts we include in the platform aren't enough for you to get the most from your data. When you want to visualize your data in a specific way that isn't possible with our charts, you can build a custom visualization. New Relic is programmable. This means that if the platform doesn't solve your specific problem, you can write and deploy your own code to fill in some of those gaps. One area where programmability is valuable is in visualizing your data. While New Relic offers all the telemetry data that your apps and services report and provides many different kinds of charts to present that data, you might need to create something entirely unique. With the New Relic One SDK, we've provided you all the tools you'll need to create your own visualizations. Build your custom visualization With the New Relic One SDK, you can create a Nerdpack, which houses your visualization code. This code consists of a React component, logic, data queries, and external dependencies. The SDK also provides a component library that you can use to make NerdGraph requests, access platform state context, and more. Your first visualization To build your first custom visualization, install the New Relic One SDK and make sure you have the latest version: bash Copy $ nr1 update Create a Nerdpack and a visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name custom-viz ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ...my-first-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-first-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization custom-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz/visualizations/custom-viz\" The visualization you created in the my-first-viz Nerdpack contains a default component to help you get started. Serve your visualization locally: bash Copy $ cd my-first-viz $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ custom-viz https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Important To view the locally served visualization, you must use the nerdpacks=local querystring. Enter values into the fields under Configure visualization properties and see how the chart changes: Resources Here is a list of resources for building custom visualizations: Build a custom visualization for dashboards (Guide) Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK (Guide) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Customize your visualization You have a lot of control over how your visualization operates. You can choose what properties of the visualization are customizable, such as colors, sizes, and how you present your legend. You can choose whether it presents New Relic data or data from an external source. You can even install and use third-party components to create a specific look: Resources Here is a list of resources for configuring custom visualizations: Configuration options (Documentation) Customize visualizations with configuration (Guide) Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (Video) Use your custom visualization During development, you can serve your visualization locally. Under Apps > Custom Visualizations, you can view and configure your visualization to see how your data looks, but you can't instantiate that chart and use it in your account: To do that, you need to publish it to the New Relic One catalog and subscribe to it from your account. Because custom visualizations are Nerdpack artifacts, you publish and subscribe to them the same way you publish and subscribe to New Relic One applications. Once you've done so, you can add your custom visualization to a dashboard: If you want to reuse your visualization to present different data or the same data in a new way, you can go back to Apps > Custom Visualizations, choose your visualization, configure another instance and add it to your dashboard: Resources Here is a list of resources for using custom visualizations: Add custom visualizations to your dashboards (Documentation) New Relic Dashboards and Custom Visualizations: Flexibility with Less Toil (Blog) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (Video)",

You can also provide access to your Nerdlet from an entity in your account. In this guide, you'll learn how to attach your Nerdlet to your entities. Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install and configure the New Relic One CLI Create a Nerdpack Step 1 of 5 Update your CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 5 Create a Nerdpack with the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name entity-nerdlet This results in a Nerdpack, called entity-nerdlet, which consists of a launcher, called entity-nerdlet-launcher, and a Nerdlet, called entity-nerdlet-nerdlet. Step 3 of 5 Serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ cd entity-nerdlet $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 4 of 5 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and navigate to Apps: ?nerdpacks=local is required to enable your locally served Nerdpacks to load in New Relic. Step 5 of 5 Under Your apps, click your launcher to view your New Relic One application: Attach your Nerdlet to entities You've seen how you can access your Nerdlet from a launcher. Now, access your Nerdlet from your entities. Step 1 of 6 From inside your Nerdpack's root directory, open nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json. This is your Nerdlet's metadata file. You'll use this file to attach your Nerdlet to entities. Step 2 of 6 Add a context object with an entities array: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [] 8 } 9 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy This tells New Relic that you want to surface your Nerdlet in an array of entity contexts. Step 3 of 6 Add an entity context: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [ 8 { 9 \"domain\": \"APM\", 10 \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" 11 } 12 ] 13 } 14 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Here, you've attached your Nerdlet to all application entities in the APM domain. Step 4 of 6 Go to APM: Because you're serving your Nerdpack locally, remember that you must still specify the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 5 of 6 Choose any of your applications: Step 6 of 6 Scroll down to see your Nerdlet attached to the application: Click this menu option and see your Nerdlet the same way you did with the launcher. Configure your entities context The context.entities key in your Nerdlet's nr1.json file specifies which entities your Nerdlet should be attached to. Specify an entity domain Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity domain by specifying the domain as one of the following values: APM: Application Performance Monitoring BROWSER: Browser INFRA: Infrastructure monitoring MOBILE: Mobile monitoring SYNTH: Synthetic monitoring For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities in the APM domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those in a domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"!APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities in multiple domains: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" }] } } Copy Specify an entity type Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity type by specifying the type as one of the following values: APPLICATION HOST MONITOR For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities of the APPLICATION type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those of a specified type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"!APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity whose type matches one of an array of types: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }, { \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }] } } Copy Specify entity tags Attach your Nerdlet to entities that have a given tag. For example, attach your Nerdlet to the entity which has a particular GUID: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"guid\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ENTITY GUID>\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity which has particular accountId and uses the Python programming language: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"accountId\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ACCOUNT ID>\"] }, { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Combine filters When you filter the entities to which your Nerdlet will be added, you can combine domain, type, and tags: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"domain\": \"APM\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\", \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] }, { \"domain\": \"SYNTH\", \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" } ] } } Copy In this example, you've attached your Nerdlet to: All APM applications whose metadata tags specify the python language AND all Synthetic monitors AND all Browser entities",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version If you already had the CLI, update it: bash Copy $ nr1 update Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start. You’re ready to build an application with the New Relic One CLI! Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

When you build a New Relic One application, it's valuable to view it on the platform. This helps you design, implement, and debug your application in the environment it will eventually be published to. With nr1, you can launch a development server that hosts your application so that New Relic One can present it to you. Step 1 of 4 From inside the Nerdpack's root directory, serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve When the Nerdpack has succeeded building and your application is ready to view, you'll see a message with a link to New Relic One: bash Copy ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! Notice the appended query parameter nerdpacks=local. This query parameter tells New Relic to show locally served Nerdpacks. Tip If you don't see your application on the New Relic platform, make sure you've included nerdpacks=local in your querystring!

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add navigation to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you finished the A/B test application you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to prepare it for publication. When you publish your app to the New Relic One catalog, users can view it and subscribe to it. You can help your users by showing and telling them what the app does, how to use it, and more. Create catalog information To supply information to the catalog about your app, you need to create the catalog directory in your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 6 Change to the describe-app/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test Step 2 of 6 Create the catalog directory: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog This creates a catalog directory with template files for inputting custom information about your app. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog directory. Step 3 of 6 Update catalog/documentation.md: ## Documentation This application combines and presents data from New Relic and the Nerdsletter API so that we can make an informed decision on which design version results in more high-quality newsletter subscriptions. It also presents an button to end the test, which saves the date and version descriptions in local storage. We can use this app for future A/B tests as well! catalog/documentation.md Copy For this course, you're keeping the documentation concise by merely describing what the app does. In your own projects, you might also include instructions for contributing to the project in an open source context, installing the app's dependencies, or anything else that might help a user navigate complexities in your app or code. Step 4 of 6 Update catalog/config.json: { \"tagline\": \"Win @ newsletter subscriptions\", \"details\": \"Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course\", \"whatsNew\": \"Initial release! Includes:\\n- A variety of charts for understanding the test results\\n- An end test button for storing some test data in a table\", \"support\": { \"email\": { \"address\": \"\" }, \"issues\": { \"url\": \"\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"\" } } } catalog/config.json Copy Here, you've specified a tagline, project details, the source code repository, and a short list of everything included in the initial release. In other projects, you might also add a support email or support links. Step 5 of 6 Save the this screenshot to your catalog/screenshots directory. Users will be able to see a carousel of screenshots in your app's About page in the catalog. Step 6 of 6 Save the following icon as icon.png in two places: nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test/launchers/ab-test-launcher This will act as the launcher's icon and the app's catalog icon on the About page. Now you've added documentation, screenshots, metadata, and an icon to your app so that users will be able to understand what it does and why they might need it. For now, these files are all local and they need to be submitted to the catalog. But before you can do that, your app, itself, needs to be published to the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll publish your app, submit your catalog information, and view the results in New Relic.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Fetch data from a third-party service, before starting this one. In this course, you're building a New Relic One application. This application shows telemetry data from a demo service that is running an A/B test so that it can reveal that data in charts, like a dashboard. Your New Relic application is different than a dashboard, however, because it does more than show New Relic data. It pulls external data, provides UI components and functionality, and even has its own small data stores. The purpose of this New Relic application is to present context so you can better understand the A/B test results and how those results tie in to your business objectives. So far, you've built all your charts, organized them for improved usability, provided them with real data, and more. There are some final improvements you can make, using Platform API components. In this lesson, you learn how to use values in the New Relic platform state. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-platform-state-context/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, add a PlatformStateContext.Consumer to your NewsletterSignups component's render() method: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Notice that NrqlQuery uses a constant called ACCOUNT_ID. Instead of hardcoding an account identifier in your Nerdlet, you can use accountId from the platform URL state. Step 3 of 10 PlatformStateContext.Consumer provides access to the platform's URL state. This context contains an important value you'll use in your app, called timeRange. Notice that your NrqlQuery uses a SINCE clause that identifies the historical timeframe your query should fetch data from. Right now, that SINCE clause is set to 30 MINUTES AGO. With timeRange, you can use the platform's time picker to make this timeframe adjustable. Step 4 of 10 Utilize the platform state's timeRange: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, NewsletterSignups uses platformState.timeRange instead of a hardcoded SINCE clause. While NrqlQuery components accept a convenient timeRange prop, not every component does. You can still use timeRange in other contexts by accessing duration, begin_time, or end_time: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { console.log(platformState.timeRange.duration); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>; Copy Step 5 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test. Step 6 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 7 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 10 View your application: Your NrqlQuery now uses the platform state's timeRange, but your chart probably still shows the last 30 minutes. Why? Where does the timeRange in platform state come from? The time picker sits on the right side of your application's navigation bar: Change this value and see your chart update: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 9 of 10 Update VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Of all the charts in your New Relic One application, these three charts are the ones that should update with the time picker. The others, Total subscriptions per version, Total cancellations per version, Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions, Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, show total values over time. So, hardcoding their SINCE clauses to 7 DAYS AGO makes sense, as this is a reasonable time period for the purposes of this course. Step 10 of 10 While still serving your Nerdpack locally, view your NR1 app to see your charts updating with the time range you choose: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now that you're basing your queries off the platform state, some of your charts are dynamic in their time ranges. This is a great improvement because it allows you to adjust your charts to show data from any particular point in time, which is useful for tying data to business outcomes. The Platform API components offer a lot more functionality, too, including the ability to navigate the user to another place in New Relic. You'll learn how to do this in the next lesson.

      "body": "One way for users to access your Nerdlet is by creating a launcher. The launcher opens a Nerdlet from the Apps page in New Relic. You can also provide access to your Nerdlet from an entity in your account. In this guide, you'll learn how to attach your Nerdlet to your entities. Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install and configure the New Relic One CLI Create a Nerdpack Step 1 of 5 Update your CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 5 Create a Nerdpack with the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name entity-nerdlet This results in a Nerdpack, called entity-nerdlet, which consists of a launcher, called entity-nerdlet-launcher, and a Nerdlet, called entity-nerdlet-nerdlet. Step 3 of 5 Serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ cd entity-nerdlet $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 4 of 5 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and navigate to Apps: ?nerdpacks=local is required to enable your locally served Nerdpacks to load in New Relic. Step 5 of 5 Under Your apps, click your launcher to view your New Relic One application: Attach your Nerdlet to entities You've seen how you can access your Nerdlet from a launcher. Now, access your Nerdlet from your entities. Step 1 of 6 From inside your Nerdpack's root directory, open nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json. This is your Nerdlet's metadata file. You'll use this file to attach your Nerdlet to entities. Step 2 of 6 Add a context object with an entities array: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [] 8 } 9 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy This tells New Relic that you want to surface your Nerdlet in an array of entity contexts. Step 3 of 6 Add an entity context: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [ 8 { 9 \"domain\": \"APM\", 10 \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" 11 } 12 ] 13 } 14 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Here, you've attached your Nerdlet to all application entities in the APM domain. Step 4 of 6 Go to APM: Because you're serving your Nerdpack locally, remember that you must still specify the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 5 of 6 Choose any of your applications: Step 6 of 6 Scroll down to see your Nerdlet attached to the application: Click this menu option and see your Nerdlet the same way you did with the launcher. Configure your entities context The context.entities key in your Nerdlet's nr1.json file specifies which entities your Nerdlet should be attached to. Specify an entity domain Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity domain by specifying the domain as one of the following values: APM: Application Performance Monitoring BROWSER: Browser INFRA: Infrastructure monitoring MOBILE: Mobile monitoring SYNTH: Synthetic monitoring For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities in the APM domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those in a domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"!APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities in multiple domains: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" }] } } Copy Specify an entity type Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity type by specifying the type as one of the following values: APPLICATION HOST MONITOR For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities of the APPLICATION type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those of a specified type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"!APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity whose type matches one of an array of types: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }, { \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }] } } Copy Specify entity tags Attach your Nerdlet to entities that have a given tag. For example, attach your Nerdlet to the entity which has a particular GUID: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"guid\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ENTITY GUID>\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity which has particular accountId and uses the Python programming language: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"accountId\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ACCOUNT ID>\"] }, { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Combine filters When you filter the entities to which your Nerdlet will be added, you can combine domain, type, and tags: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"domain\": \"APM\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\", \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] }, { \"domain\": \"SYNTH\", \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" } ] } } Copy In this example, you've attached your Nerdlet to: All APM applications whose metadata tags specify the python language AND all Synthetic monitors AND all Browser entities",

When you build a New Relic One application, it's valuable to view it on the platform. This helps you design, implement, and debug your application in the environment it will eventually be published to. With nr1, you can launch a development server that hosts your application so that New Relic One can present it to you.

Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! Notice the appended query parameter nerdpacks=local. This query parameter tells New Relic to show locally served Nerdpacks. Tip If you don't see your application on the New Relic platform, make sure you've included nerdpacks=local in your querystring!

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add chart components to your A/B test application, before starting this one. In this course, you’re building an A/B test application for the New Relic platform. Previously, you learned about the New Relic One SDK and its component library. Now, It’s time for you to start building your application focusing first on chart components. Before you write any code, consult your design guide to remember what the application will look like when you finish: There are several charts you need to create, which may seem overwhelming at first, but take it one step at a time. The topmost chart, and the first you’ll create, is a line chart that shows the number of users who sign up for your newsletter and what version of your website they were shown. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-your-first-chart/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-your-first-chart/ab-test This directory contains the code your application should have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named newsletter-signups.js: bash Copy $ touch newsletter-signups.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a component called NewsletterSignups to hold your first LineChart and some mock data: import React from 'react'; import { LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } const versionBSignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-b-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 20 }, { x: 10, y: 5 }, { x: 20, y: 25 }, { x: 30, y: 45 }, { x: 40, y: 50 }, { x: 50, y: 35 }, ], } return <LineChart data={[versionASignups, versionBSignups]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Here, you’ve created two arbitrary data series which represent versions A and B of your test. Right now, you're using manually-crafted data points. In the future, you'll replace these with data queried from New Relic. Notice that you’ve specified a color for each series in the chart. The color metadata attribute takes any CSS-acceptable color format. Setting viz: 'main' means that you want to render the LineChart series as a line, the component's default display style. For the data prop in the LineChart component, you passed the two series in an array so that both are represented together. Finally, you used the chart’s fullWidth prop to stretch the chart’s width to fill the view. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and replace the default heading in your Nerdlet's render() method with your new component: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-your-first-chart/ab-test. Step 6 of 8 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 7 of 8 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the LineChart displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. In seven steps, you’ve breathed life into your New Relic One application. Instead of a bland “Hello world” message, your application now shows a colorful line chart with two mocked data series. These data series represent server-side traffic for each of the competing designs in your demo website. In the next lesson, you’ll build on this foundation by creating another chart type.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add your first chart, before starting this one. You’ve begun building your A/B test application. So far, it consists of a single line chart, which represents the number of subscriptions your newsletter receives from each version of your website. To understand what you’ll build in this lesson, review the design guide to remember what charts come next: In the design, there are two pie charts beneath the line chart that you’ve already created. One represents the distribution of users who receive version A and version B. The other represents the distribution of successful requests from users who got version A and version B. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-pie-charts/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add two new Javascript files: total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js bash Copy $ touch total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js Step 3 of 9 In total-subscriptions.js, create a component, called TotalSubscriptions, which renders mocked subscription data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Notice that the series data is formatted differently for PieChart than it was for LineChart. Because PieChart uses unidimensional data, its series only take y-values. Step 4 of 9 In total-cancellations.js, create a component, called TotalCancellations, which renders mocked cancellation data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new components and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the PieChart components displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Your application is starting to take shape. You’ve created a line chart and two pie charts. For now, these charts use mocked data, but you’ll provide them real data in a later lesson. Before you focus on the data in your charts, however, you’ll learn how to add a table to your application so you can visualize data in a new way.

Observe your platform New Relic One gives you full access to the data from all the entities in your stack. Go to the New Relic Explorer at one.newrelic.com to see a full list of entities, identify overall behaviors, filter them to locate sources of performance issues, or plan improvements for your system. Search accounts and entities Access Quick find clicking the button at the top right corner of the New Relic One UI. Some details about your search: You can search across all your New Relic accounts with cross-account access. Entities that cease to exist are available in search for eight days. If your organization has multiple accounts, use the account picker at the top left corner to select accounts. Use chart and query features You can add most charts to a new or existing dashboard. Here are some query and chart features available across all or most of the platform: If you want to... Do this... Start querying your data Mouse over Browse data and select metrics, events, logs, or traces for a direct access to any of those types of data. Also, at the top of any UI page, select Query your data to access the data explorer and query builder. View a chart's query For some charts, you can view the NRQL query used to generate that chart. This can help you understand a chart better or use it as the basis for a new query. Choose time range Drag across a section of a chart to zoom in on that time range. Or, use the time picker in the top right corner of the UI to select pre-set time ranges or set a custom one. View chart details Mouse over a chart to see a pop-up with more detail. For some charts, selecting a point on the chart will take you to a UI page with more information about that metric. Hide or return chart elements To hide or unhide a displayed chart element, select that element's name below the chart. The chart display will adjust to reflect the absence or presence of that element. Share with teammates Here are some options for sharing New Relic UI pages and visualizations. If you want to... Do this... Share UI pages and dashboards To share an entire New Relic UI page, click Share near the top of the UI to copy the URL. Share charts If New Relic charts are built with NRQL queries, they have a menu that exposes various options, including sharing options like Get as image and Get chart link. Some notes about sharing: The person you share with may not have access to view the data from that account. To solve that, someone on your team with New Relic user management abilities must add that person to the account. If someone can't access a custom dashboard, it may be that it is set to private. Read more about dashboard permissions. Some sharing options have associated time ranges, which may impact later viewings of it. For example, if you use a chart's Get chart link option and that chart is set to 'Last 30 minutes', when viewed it will show the last 30 minutes, not the time range displayed when it was shared. To share a specific time range, you must select that time range in the UI. Smooth navigation: Customize your bar and access the shortcuts Select the edit icon at the right end of the navigation bar to customize your view. Home, Explorer, Browse data, Dashboards, and Alerts & AI are fixed, but you can favorite up to six more elements to display on the bar as well. The rest will go on the More group. Navigation shortcuts are a faster way to find entities and apps that are relevant to you. Mouse over any menu item for quick access to your favorite entities, those you recently visited, or just to search without having to navigate to a specific section. If you click on an entity, you can choose to open it in the same browser tab or in a new one. Adjust account and user settings To adjust account settings and user preferences, and to get support and docs links, use the account dropdown, located at the top right of the UI, beside your user name.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Clone your dashboard You can clone your dashboard clicking the clone icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the clone is added to the index. The clone has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, cloned dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The cloned dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you clone a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the clone is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you clone it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Access the query builder to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add tables, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you added a variety of charts to your A/B test application. These charts presented different facets of information about your A/B test, and they behaved independently from one other. In this lesson, you’ll create a new pair of line charts and learn how to synchronize their behaviors. Before you write any new code, consult your design guide to understand the role that these new charts will play in your application: In the design guide, there is a line graph under each of the tables you created in the last lesson. These line graphs show the version-specific response times for newsletter signup requests. Now, you’ll build two more line charts, but this time, you’ll group them with a ChartGroup and specify that their values are measured in milliseconds. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-a-chart-group/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named page-views.js: bash Copy $ touch page-views.js Step 3 of 9 In this new file, create a component called VersionPageViews to hold a LineChart, which shows the number of times a page is viewed: import React from 'react'; import { LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Notice the new attribute in the series' metadata fields: units_data. This attribute describes the unit type for a specified data axis. In this case, you set the unit type for the y axis to 'MS', which stands for milliseconds. Other options for unit types, include: 'PERCENTAGE', 'TIMESTAMP', and 'BYTES_PER_SECOND'. Step 4 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In index.js, import ChartGroup from nr1 and group your VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <ChartGroup> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </ChartGroup> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Because the tables are conceptually related, as they show contrasting performance metrics over the same timeslice, it makes sense to group them in a ChartGroup. This means that the two charts behave synchronously. For example, when you hover over one chart, the other chart shows a hover indicator at the same x coordinate. Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the LineChart components synchronized in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Tip Each of the chart component types you've used in this lesson have had different series configurations. Most chart components share the same metadata attributes, like LineChart and PieChart, but differ in their data formats. It's helpful to be aware of the different data formats, for when you create your own charts. You can read more about the data formats in the chart component documentation. Now your application is filled with charts, but it doesn't look great. The charts are stacked on top of one another in an unhelpful way. In the next lesson, you'll learn about the user interface components from the SDK and how you can use them to organize your charts.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add user interface components to your application, before starting this one. In previous hands-on lessons, you created all the charts from your design guide. Unfortunately, they aren’t laid out like they are in the design. The New Relic One SDK provides multiple solutions for organizing your components. The one you’ll learn about in this lesson is the Grid component. To arrange your charts, place them in a Grid. A Grid is a container you use to organize your content into 12-column rows. A GridItem is the building block for a Grid. You specify the columnSpan of a GridItem between 1 and 12 to determine how much of the row that the GridItem should cover. So, if you want a chart to stretch across the width of the view, you would place the chart in a GridItem with a columnSpan of 12. If you want twelve charts to fit in a single row, use a columnSpan of 1. Using the design guide as a base, you can plan how to organize your Grid: Once you’ve planned out how you’re going to arrange your columns, you can write some code to realize your plans. Step 1 of 6 Change to the add-a-grid/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import Grid and GridItem. Then, update your Nerdlet's render() method by placing each chart in a GrildItem. Finally, place all your items in a Grid: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy The columnSpan for each chart matches the layout plan. Every chart that takes up half the 12-column row has a columnSpan of 6, and every chart that takes up the whole row has a columnSpan of 12. Notice that each of the charts in the ChartGroup, but not the ChartGroup itself, is in a GridItem. A ChartGroup connects charts' behaviors, not their locations. Each chart fills its columnSpan because they use the fullWidth prop. fullWidth makes the chart fill its available horizontal space and GridItem.columnSpan restricts that space to some fraction of the row. Remove a fullWidth prop, and see how the chart reacts. Technical detail Notice the wrapper class applied to the Grid. We quietly provided some CSS styles to help make this app look great! This isn't a CSS course, so we won't cover everything we added, we'll just include the styles we intend for you to use in the code snippets. Just know that every UI component in the New Relic One SDK provides a className prop where you can provide a CSS class name. You can view the styles in nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see your charts styled and arranged in a grid. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. In just six steps, you significantly improved the readability and usability of your A/B test application, but you can take further steps to improve the usability of your charts. In the next lesson, you’ll add headings to your charts to remind yourself of what data each chart presents. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. When you're ready, continue on to the next lesson: Add chart headings.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add NrqlQuery components to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In this series, you're creating a New Relic One application, or NR1 app for short, that shows A/B test data in a variety of charts. Most of the charts need to show data that comes from a demo service you spun up at the beginning of this series. To refresh your memory on what you're building, review your design guide: In the last lesson, you supplied real data, which comes from New Relic's database, to the following charts: Newsletter subscriptions per version Version A - Page views Version B - Page views Total subscriptions per version Because you have experience querying subscription and page view data, you may feel ready to supply data to even more charts: Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions However, these charts are different than the charts you've supplied data to because they compare data from two different sources: subscription events and pageView events. In this lesson, you learn how to format data from multiple sources to exist in the same chart. Experiment with data in the Data explorer Step 1 of 6 From your New Relic homepage's top navigation menu, go to to the Data explorer: Here, you can experiment with subscription event and pageView event queries to make sure you fetch the right data in your app. Step 2 of 6 Select subscription from the Custom events menu: This queries NRDB for subscription event totals per minute over the last 30 minutes and shows that data in a chart: Step 3 of 6 Click Dimensions to see a list of the attributes associated with these subscription events: You can filter and group subscription events using these dimensions. For Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, you want to filter your subscription totals by page_version. Step 4 of 6 Click the NRQL query to navigate to the Query builder: Here, you can view and manually edit the query to fetch the data you need. Step 5 of 6 Add a WHERE clause to filter subscription totals by page_version: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Remove the TIMESERIES clause to fetch a count: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO Copy Modify the SINCE clause to see totals over the past week: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO Copy Click Run and see the data visualized in a billboard chart instead of a line chart: Step 6 of 6 Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions need a combined total of four data values: All-time subscription totals for version A All-time page view totals for version A All-time subscription totals for version B All-time page view totals for version B Experiment with the Query builder to discover the four queries which pull the right data. In the end, you'll come up with the following four queries: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'b' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = 'b' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO Copy technical detail Unlike other structured query languages, NRQL doesn't provide a mechanism for joining data across sources. This is why you have to perform two queries to get subscription event totals and pageView event totals. Until now, you've provided every chart with a single query. Here, you have to provide two queries per chart. In the remaining steps, you'll learn how to customize NrqlQuery results to merge data from multiple sources. Merge NRQL from multiple sources Step 1 of 9 Change to the customize-nrql-data/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/customize-nrql-data/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 9 In your Nerdlet's totals.js file, implement constructor() and the React lifecycle method componentDidMount() in VersionTotals: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { tableData: { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } } } componentDidMount() { NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[0].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[1].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[this.state.tableData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Here, you initialize your state in the component's constructor. The state has a single value, tableData, which holds series data and metadata for the TableChart. In componentDidMount(), you query the data that populates the data in this state. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that is called when a component is mounted in the component tree. You use this method, instead of the constructor, to query data because your logic, which requests data from New Relic, introduces side effects and sets state values, neither of which you should do in the constructor. In componentDidMount(), you use NrqlQuery in a new way. First, you specified the formatType to NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW because you're going to modify the data instead of supplying it directly to a chart Before, you used its JSX form in the render() method of a chart. Second, you called its query() method and handled the results in a then() callback, which logs them to the console. Step 3 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, create a constant called ACCOUNT_ID and pass it to VersionTotals: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/ Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 4 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/customize-nrql-data/ab-test. Step 5 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 6 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Navigate to your app in New Relic. Step 7 of 9 To view your logs, which are useful for uncovering errors in your application, turn on developer tools in your favorite browser and navigate to the Console: FireFox instructions Safari instructions Chrome instructions With your app on-screen, notice the NRQL data in the console: This console log tells you that you can find the data you're looking for, namely the subscription or pageView count, at data.raw.results[0].count. The next step is to store that count in state.tableData. Tip If something doesn't work, use these debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 8 of 9 In totals.js, store the query data in state: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { tableData: { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } } } componentDidMount() { NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[0].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[1].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[this.state.tableData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Pay close attention to the data you're accessing. The array indices are particularly important to get right. The subscription data should go to state.tableData.data[0].count because in tableData, it is the first element in the data array: data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], Copy By similar logic, page view data should go to state.tableData.data[1].count. Step 9 of 9 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID In this lesson, you learned how to use NrqlQuery.query() to fetch data from multiple sources and stitch them together into data your chart can use. Notice that there are still two charts in your NR1 application that use mock data: Total unsubscriptions per version Past tests Unfortunately, your demo application doesn't create custom New Relic events when a user unsubscribes from your newsletter or you end an A/B test. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to populate Past tests.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Persist the selected version, before starting this one. In this tutorial, you're building an A/B test application. The application surfaces data about an ongoing A/B test on your website, which you then use to decide which page design version is most effective at engaging users. As part of that overarching goal, you're building a section which allows you to end the test by deciding a winner of the experiment: Unfortunately, there are a few issues with the code and design for this section. By the end of this course, pressing End test will tell your website's backend server that every customer should see the version selected here. This is destructive behavior because it makes an irreversible change to your website. To account for the desctructiveness of pressing End test, you need to modify some features of your application: Make the button look important to catch your eye Prompt yourself with a confirmation message before ending the test to ensure you don't end it prematurely Show and hide your confirmation modal Step 1 of 12 Change to the present-confirmation-modal/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test This directory contains the code your application should have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 12 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, update the Button to use the DESTRUCTIVE styling: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Tip Read more about Button and its props on the New Relic developer site. Step 3 of 12 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test. Step 4 of 12 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 12 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 12 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: Now you've styled your button to convey its destructive consequences, but that's not enough to prevent you from accidentally clicking it. Next, you create a shield for your website's backend. This extra layer of protection requires you to confirm that you intend to end the test before actually doing so. Step 7 of 12 Add a Modal to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Your new modal contains a heading, a confirmation message, the winning design version, and two buttons. You'll explore some of these components later in this course. With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your new Modal: Tip Remember, while your server is running, it will update automatically when you save your code. The modal looks great, but it has three issues: It was present before you clicked End test You can't dismiss it It always says you selected \"Version A\", even if you didn't In the following steps, you'll correct all three of these issues. Step 8 of 12 In EndTestButton, initialize state with a value for modalHidden: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy modalHidden determines whether or not to hide the modal. The default value of modalHidden is true because you only want to show the modal when you select End test. Step 9 of 12 Supply modalHidden to the Modal: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy First, you've created a constructor to accept component props. This provides your component access to the modalHidden prop that you passed in EndTestSection. Then you provide the value of modalHidden to the Modal component's hidden prop. Tip Read more about Modal and its props on the New Relic developer site. Step 10 of 12 Add and bind two new methods to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Use closeModal and showModal to close and show your modal, respectively, depending on how a user interacts with the modal. Step 11 of 12 Show the modal when you click End test: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you've supplied showModal() as the callback for the Button component's onClick event. Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. The modal is hidden by default. Click End test to see the modal. Step 12 of 12 Close the modal from the Modal component's onClose callback and from the Yes, end test and No, continue test buttons: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Click End test. The modal opens and displays your confirmation message. Close the modal by clicking X at the top right, either of its buttons, or even in the dark space to its left. Notice that the modal says you chose \"Version A\", even if you choose \"Version B\". This is because \"Version A\" is hardcoded in the Modal text. Next, you'll make that dynamic. Use the version you selected in your modal Step 1 of 2 In EndTestSection, pass selectedVersion to the EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Now, you can access the selected version from the EndTestButton component's props. Step 2 of 2 Use selectedVersion in your confirmation message: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Select \"Version B\" from the menu. Click End test to see \"Version B\" in the confirmation modal: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Congratulations! You've done a lot of work and it shows in the usefulness of your application. You've created charts that show mocked data. You've organized your charts into a readable structure. You've added an interface for your users to interact with the test. Now, you need some real data.

In this course, you're building a New Relic One application. This application shows telemetry data from a demo service that is running an A/B test so that it can reveal that data in charts, like a dashboard. Your New Relic application is different than a dashboard, however, because it does more than show New Relic data. It pulls external data, provides UI components and functionality, and even has its own small data stores. The purpose of this New Relic application is to present context so you can better understand the A/B test results and how those results tie in to your business objectives. So far, you've built all your charts, organized them for improved usability, provided them with real data, and more. There are some final improvements you can make, using Platform API components. In this lesson, you learn how to use values in the New Relic platform state. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-platform-state-context/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, add a PlatformStateContext.Consumer to your NewsletterSignups component's render() method: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Notice that NrqlQuery uses a constant called ACCOUNT_ID. Instead of hardcoding an account identifier in your Nerdlet, you can use accountId from the platform URL state. Step 3 of 10 PlatformStateContext.Consumer provides access to the platform's URL state. This context contains an important value you'll use in your app, called timeRange. Notice that your NrqlQuery uses a SINCE clause that identifies the historical timeframe your query should fetch data from. Right now, that SINCE clause is set to 30 MINUTES AGO. With timeRange, you can use the platform's time picker to make this timeframe adjustable. Step 4 of 10 Utilize the platform state's timeRange: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, NewsletterSignups uses platformState.timeRange instead of a hardcoded SINCE clause. While NrqlQuery components accept a convenient timeRange prop, not every component does. You can still use timeRange in other contexts by accessing duration, begin_time, or end_time: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { console.log(platformState.timeRange.duration); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>; Copy Step 5 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test. Step 6 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 7 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 10 View your application: Your NrqlQuery now uses the platform state's timeRange, but your chart probably still shows the last 30 minutes. Why? Where does the timeRange in platform state come from? The time picker sits on the right side of your application's navigation bar: Change this value and see your chart update: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 9 of 10 Update VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Of all the charts in your New Relic One application, these three charts are the ones that should update with the time picker. The others, Total subscriptions per version, Total cancellations per version, Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions, Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, show total values over time. So, hardcoding their SINCE clauses to 7 DAYS AGO makes sense, as this is a reasonable time period for the purposes of this course. Step 10 of 10 While still serving your Nerdpack locally, view your NR1 app to see your charts updating with the time range you choose: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now that you're basing your queries off the platform state, some of your charts are dynamic in their time ranges. This is a great improvement because it allows you to adjust your charts to show data from any particular point in time, which is useful for tying data to business outcomes. The Platform API components offer a lot more functionality, too, including the ability to navigate the user to another place in New Relic. You'll learn how to do this in the next lesson.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you used PlatformStateContext from the New Relic One SDK to look up the time range that the user selected from the app's time picker. Now, you'll learn about another component that interacts with the New Relic platform: navigation. The navigation component lets you open entities, navigate to entities, and build Location objects for entities from your Nerdlet. You can also use navigation for other Nerdlets and launchers. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-navigation/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In newsletter-signups.js, create a new method, called NewsletterSignups.openApmEntity(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. This method uses navigation.openStackedEntity() to display your demo application's APM entity in a stacked view. Notice openApmEntity() requires your ENTITY_GUID. You need to locate that ID and store it in a constant. Step 3 of 10 Navigate to APM: See metadata for your Newsletter service: Copy the entity's GUID: Create an ENTITY_GUID constant: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and the entity GUID you just copied, respectively. Now, openApmEntity() knows what entity to show. Next, you need to create a button to invoke this method. Step 4 of 10 Create a button to show your APM entity: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you've created a button and configured it to call openApmEntity() when it's clicked. Step 5 of 10 Import Stack and StackItem: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. You'll use Stack and StackItem to lay out the button on the far right side of the same row that the HeadingText is on. Step 6 of 10 Lay out the Stack: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <Stack fullWidth> <StackItem grow={true}> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> </StackItem> <StackItem> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> </StackItem> </Stack> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you used a full-width Stack to set up the layout for the row. To make the HeadingText fill the entire row except the width of the button, you used the StackItem.grow prop. Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. Click App performance: Now you see the stacked entity: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively Congratulations! You're finished writing all the code you'll write for your New Relic One A/B test application. Now, you have an application reporting New Relic data from your demo service that is running an A/B test. You've created several charts, buttons, and other UI elements. And you've organized your components into a readable and usable view. On top of the visuals, you've supplied data to your charts from multiple data sources in and outside of New Relic. You've created some backend functionality which utilizes your New Relic One application's own data store. You've also utilized the platform APIs for interacting with platform UI and showing a stacked entity view. You've really accomplished a lot throughout this course, so far. There are only a few things left to do! First, is to learn how to publish and subscribe to your New Relic One application so that it can run on our platform instead of your own local server. Second, is to learn how to deal with some common issues you might see in New Relic One application development. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Describe your app for the catalog.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add a new configuration option Step 1 of 8 In your visualization's nr1.json file, add an enum configuration object for selectedChart: index.js nr1.json 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 'Radar': 'radar', 24 'Treemap': 'treemap' 25 } 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

Step 3 of 8 Serve your Nerdpack locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve If you're still serving your Nerdpack from the last lesson, you need to stop it with CTRL-X and serve it again to reflect changes to nr1.json. Step 4 of 8 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The nerdpacks=local query string directs the UI to load your visualization from the local server. Step 5 of 8 Open the Apps page: Step 6 of 8 Go to Custom Visualizations, which is favorited by default: Step 7 of 8 In Custom Visualizations, find and click your visualization: Step 8 of 8 Notice the new Select chart configuration option: Selecting a chart type doesn't effect your visualization. This is because you first need to introduce the selectedChart property to the visualization component. Then, you use selectedChart to determine the chart type to render. Replace your SegmentedControl with the configurable property Step 1 of 5 Open your visualization's index.js file. You'll be working here for the rest of the guide.

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type.

      "info": "Build a \"Hello, World!\" app and publish it to New Relic One",
      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in the New Relic One Catalog, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One app catalog. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

Resolve issues with accessing your local Nerdpack Sometimes, when you serve your Nerdpack locally, you may come across issues. You may be unable to serve your Nerdpack because of bugs in your code. Or, you may successfully serve your Nerdpack but be unable to find it in New Relic. Consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your application When you attempt to serve your Nerdpack locally, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve --verbose Show locally served Nerdpacks If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, make sure you're using the ?nerdpacks=local query string. If you're not, New Relic won't load your locally served Nerdpack on the platform. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you serve your Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:serve, you must be signed into the same profile in New Relic that you're serving with locally. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic and you're using the correct query string, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same. Access your proxy browser Generally, you don't need to know how your application code is loaded in New Relic. But understanding how it works can help you resolve issues with your local server. When you run nr1 nerdpack:serve, your code is served by your local machine using an nr-local.net subdomain. This domain points to 127.0.0.1, and uses a variety of ports to connect, including 9973. To load a Nerdpack into the platform, whether it's locally served or published to the app catalog, New Relic uses an <IFRAME> and a separate domain (a subdomain of nr-ext.net), relying on same-domain policy to sandbox the code. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, you're using the correct query string, and you're using the correct profile, your network administrator may need to enable access to: Any subdomain of nr-local.net, or, at the very least, to any domain of the shape of <UserId>.nr-local.net, where <UserId> is a 32-hexadecimal character identifier that is unique to the user logged into the platform. You can use [0-9a-f]{32} to discriminate it. Any subdomain of nr-ext.net, or, at the very least, to any domain in the shape of <NerdpackUuid>.g <NerdpackGid>.nr-ext.net, where <NerdpackUuid> is the UUID assigned to your package, and <NerdpackGid> is zero, or a positive integer. You can use 0|[1-9]\\d+ to discriminate it. Further reading Read the nr1 nerdpack:serve documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve --help",

In this guide, you learn how to: Use the nr1 CLI to generate a default visualization Run your visualization locally where you can quickly test and iterate Publish your visualization to the New Relic One catalog Add your visualization to a dashboard Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create a new visualization Use nr1 to generate the boilerplate for a new visualization. Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called my-awesome-visualization, in a Nerdpack, called my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name my-awesome-visualization ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ... my-awesome-nerdpack ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-awesome-nerdpack is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization my-awesome-visualization is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another. Step 4 of 4 In index.js, change your component's Radar.fillOpacity: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 } from 'recharts'; 10 import {Card, CardBody, HeadingText, NrqlQuery, Spinner, AutoSizer} from 'nr1'; 11 12 export default class MyAwesomeVisualizationVisualization extends React.Component { 13 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 14 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "Most Nerdpacks in the New Relic One catalog are open-source. This means you can clone or fork their repositories, customize them to suit your specific needs, and re-publish them to use with your account. In this guide, you customize a Nerdpack with visualizations and publish it to your account. However, to customize any Nerdpack, you follow the same steps. Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the first four steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI View a Nerdpack Subscribe to the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack and open the Circular progress bar visualization in New Relic. Step 1 of 6 From your homepage at New Relic, navigate to Apps: Step 2 of 6 Click the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack in the catalog: Step 3 of 6 Add Victory Charts Visualizations to your account: Step 4 of 6 From Apps, open Custom visualizations: From the list of visualizations in Custom visualizations click Circular progress bar, which you installed as part of the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack. Step 5 of 6 Under Configure visualization properties, select your account and enter a NRQL query: Now you see a circular chart that shows a percentage based on your query. Tip Read our documentation for instructions on how to configure the progress bar visualization. Notice a few things about this visualization: You don't control the color of the chart The sections of the chart have rounded edges For the sake of this tutorial, imagine this chart represents your data exactly how you want it to, except for two things. You'd like to use straight edges and control the chart's colors manually. In the real world you may come across Nerdpacks like this where you like what they offer, but you'd like them better if you could tweak them. Well, you can tweak them, and next, you'll learn how! Step 6 of 6 Because you're going to use a tweaked version of the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack instead of the one you subscribed to, you can unsubscribe from our version now. Clone a Nerdpack Find the source code repository from the Nerdpack's catalog entry and clone it to your local machine. Step 1 of 5 From your homepage at New Relic, navigate to Apps: Step 2 of 5 Click the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack in the catalog: Step 3 of 5 Go to the Nerdpack's source code repository: All open-source Nerdpacks in the catalog have links to their source code in their catalog information. Step 4 of 5 Clone the repository: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:clone -r https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-victory-visualizations.git Now you have a local version of the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack! Notice that you used nr1 nerdpack:clone instead of git clone to copy the repo. nr1 nerdpack:clone offers built-in functionality to help keep your local copy distinct from the original Nerdpack in the New Relic One public catalog. Specifically, it generates a new Nerdpack UUID so you don't have to do this yourself: bash Copy Re-generating UUID... Committing new UUID... If you change to the nr1-victory-visualizations directory, and look at the git log, you'll see the new commit: bash Copy $ git log -1 -p commit e356bb5b10c3ecc8f93bae66d5739e1676ee21ef (HEAD -> main) Author: New Relic CLI <nr1@newrelic.com> Date: Tue May 25 14:29:37 2021 -0400 \"chore: Auto-generated UUID\" diff --git a/nr1.json b/nr1.json index 054de52..7a107b5 100644 --- a/nr1.json +++ b/nr1.json @@ -1,6 +1,6 @@ { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", - \"id\": \"cf5f13d9-815f-4907-a21d-83d02fa2a4fb\", + \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"Victory charts visualizations\", \"description\": \"Visualizations built on top of Victory charts\" } Step 5 of 5 In nr1-victory-visualizations/nr1.json, change your Nerdpack's displayName: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"269055dd-67e8-4713-8da3-bff01c6a8687\", \"displayName\": \"My custom Victory Charts visualizations\", \"description\": \"Visualizations built on top of Victory charts\" } nr1-victory-visualizations/nr1.json Copy Now when you serve or publish your custom Nerdpack, you can easily distinguish it from the original. Customize a Nerdpack Tweak the Circular progress bar visualization to use straight edges and customizable colors. Circular progress bar renders a VictoryPie with some predefined fields. The fields you'll tweak are: colorScale cornerRadius Step 1 of 8 In your local Nerdpack, open nr1-victory-visualizations/visualizations/circular-progress-bar/nr1.json. nr1.json is the Circular progress bar visualization's metadata file. Use this file to add a configurable colorScale option, which corresponds to the colorScale field on VictoryPie.

While your local server is running, it automatically recognizes changes to index.js. So, view your visualization in your browser to see the update: Perfect! You cloned and updated the open-source Circular progress bar visualization from the New Relic One catalog. The only thing left to do is publish your version to the catalog so your accounts can subscribe to it. Step 8 of 8 Now that you're ready to publish your Nerdpack, stop your local server with CTRL+C. Add a custom visualization to a dashboard Publish your version of the Victory charts Nerdpack to the catalog. Then subscribe to it and use your visualization in a dashboard. Tip Because you used nr1 clone to clone the Nerdpack's repository, your local copy already has its own UUID. This is a prerequisite for publishing your version to the New Relic One catalog. If you used git clone to copy, you need to update the Nerdpack's UUID manually: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The new generated id is ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Step 1 of 6 From its root directory, publish your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 6 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Here, you subscribed to your Nerdpack with the CLI. This is effectively the same action you performed earlier in this guide within the web UI, but from your terminal. Step 3 of 6 Go to the Apps view in New Relic: Step 4 of 6 From Apps, open Custom visualizations: From here, click the Circular progress bar visualization. Update your visualization's configuration options like you did when you were serving your Nerdpack locally. Step 5 of 6 Click Add to dashboard: Step 6 of 6 Go to your dashboard and see your new, customized circular progress bar: Summary In this guide, you: Subscribed to a Nerdpack from the New Relic One catalog Cloned an open-source Nerdpack Edited an existing visualization to meet your needs Published and subscribed to your own custom Nerdpack Added a visualization from your custom Nerdpack to a dashboard Now you know how to build off the foundation of open-source Nerdpacks, you can use the work of the New Relic developer community to fast-track the creation of apps and visualizations. Tip If you want to maintain your own version in a remote repository, consider forking the original repo.",

Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions To subscribe to a Nerdpack, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can subscribe to them: Publish your Nerdpack Tag your Nerdpack if it's published and doesn't yet have a tag Subscribe to a Nerdpack Subscribe to a published Nerdpack, with either the web UI or the nr1 CLI, to use it in your account. Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack under New Relic One catalog: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the New Relic One catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel. Tip nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:unset. Read the nr1 subscription:unset documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:unset --help Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you subscribe to a Nerdpack, you may run into issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the first four steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create and publish your Nerdpack Create a Nerdpack with a visualization. You'll add this visualization to a dashboard using NerdGraph. Further reading Because this guide is about using visualizations, not creating and publishing them, it breezes over these topics. If you're unfamiliar with visualizations or would like a thorough explanation of dealing with visualization Nerdpacks, check out the following resources: Introduction to custom visualizations Build your first custom visualization If you already have a visualization you'd like to add to a dashboard, you can skip this section. But don't forget to make the necessary code adjustments to reference your visualization instead of the one this guide uses, called my-awesome-visualization. Step 1 of 4 Update your nr1 CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Now, you have the latest version. Step 2 of 4 Create a visualization, called my-awesome-visualization, in a Nerdpack, called my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 create -t visualization -n my-awesome-visualization ✔ You’re trying to create a visualization outside of a Nerdpack. We’ll create a Nerdpack for you—what do you want to name it? … my-awesome-nerdpack ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-awesome-nerdpack is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization my-awesome-visualization is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization\" When you build a visualization with nr1 create, you get a default visualization. You'll use this default visualization throughout this course. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to your new Nerdpack: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack From here, you can run nr1 nerdpack commands. Step 4 of 4 Publish and subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Now, that your account is subscribed to your visualization, you can describe your app configurations with JSON and add it to a dashboard with NerdGraph. Describe your visualization options with JSON Whether you're adding your visualization to a new dashboard or an existing one, you need to send your configuration to NerdGraph. Your custom visualization JSON object represents a dashboard widget and consists of the following fields: Field Type Description title String Title for your dashboard widget visualization JSON The metadata for your visualization visualization.id String Your visualization's ID rawConfiguration JSON A full configuration of your widget Tip You can also add other types of widgets to dashboards with the steps in this guide, but the fields described here are specific to custom visualization widgets. For other widget types, you need to supply different data. Explore the API on your own with our NerdGraph explorer! Step 1 of 5 Start with a JSON template based on the fields you need to describe your custom visualization: { \"title\": \"\", \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"\" }, \"rawConfiguration\": {} } Copy Step 2 of 5 Give your visualization widget a title: { \"title\": \"My Awesome Visualization\", \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"\" }, \"rawConfiguration\": {} } Copy Step 3 of 5 Look up your Nerdpack ID from my-awesome-nerdpack/nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack my-awesome-nerdpack\" } my-awesome-nerdpack/nr1.json Copy Then, look up your visualization ID from my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"VISUALIZATION\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-visualization\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeVisualization\", \"description\": \"\", \"configuration\": [ { \"name\": \"nrqlQueries\", \"title\": \"NRQL Queries\", \"type\": \"collection\", \"items\": [ { \"name\": \"accountId\", \"title\": \"Account ID\", \"description\": \"Account ID to be associated with the query\", \"type\": \"account-id\" }, { \"name\": \"query\", \"title\": \"Query\", \"description\": \"NRQL query for visualization\", \"type\": \"nrql\" } ] }, { \"name\": \"fill\", \"title\": \"Fill color\", \"description\": \"A fill color to override the default fill color\", \"type\": \"string\" }, { \"name\": \"stroke\", \"title\": \"Stroke color\", \"description\": \"A stroke color to override the default stroke color\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json Copy Set your visualization widget's visualization.id to the form {NERDPACK-ID}.{VISUALIZATION-ID}: { \"title\": \"My Awesome Visualization\", \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, \"rawConfiguration\": {} } Copy Step 4 of 5 In my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json, review your configuration options: { \"schemaType\": \"VISUALIZATION\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-visualization\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeVisualization\", \"description\": \"\", \"configuration\": [ { \"name\": \"nrqlQueries\", \"title\": \"NRQL Queries\", \"type\": \"collection\", \"items\": [ { \"name\": \"accountId\", \"title\": \"Account ID\", \"description\": \"Account ID to be associated with the query\", \"type\": \"account-id\" }, { \"name\": \"query\", \"title\": \"Query\", \"description\": \"NRQL query for visualization\", \"type\": \"nrql\" } ] }, { \"name\": \"fill\", \"title\": \"Fill color\", \"description\": \"A fill color to override the default fill color\", \"type\": \"string\" }, { \"name\": \"stroke\", \"title\": \"Stroke color\", \"description\": \"A stroke color to override the default stroke color\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json Copy The name fields in configuration are important for describing your visualization widget. Step 5 of 5 Using the name field for every configuration object in your visualization's nr1.json file, build a rawConfiguration for your widget: { \"title\": \"My Awesome Visualization\", \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1234567, \"query\": \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], \"fill\": \"pink\", \"stroke\": \"green\" } } Copy Here, you've created a rawConfiguration by supplying values for each configuration option in nr1.json. Note that nrqlQueries is an array because its type is collection. The other values are strings. Learn more about these configuration options in Configure your custom visualization. Now that you've described your visualization widget in JSON, you can add your configured visualization to a dashboard. In the next section, you'll learn how to create a new dashboard with your visualization. If you already have one ready, skip ahead to add your visualization to your existing dashboard. Create a new dashboard with your visualization If you want to create a new dashboard for your visualization widget, use NerdGraph's dashboardCreate() mutation. The NerdGraph dashboardCreate() mutation takes the following fields: Field Type Description accountId Integer The ID for the account for which you want to create your dashboard dashboard JSON The details of the dashboard you're creating dashboard.name String The name of your dashboard dashboard.permissions Enum: PRIVATE, PUBLIC_READ_ONLY, PUBLIC_READ_WRITE The access control of your dashboard dashboard.pages Array: JSON The details of your dashboard's pages dashboard.pages[].name String The name of the dashboard page dashboard.pages[].widgets Array: JSON The widgets to add to the dashboard page Tip You can also pass more fields to dashboardCreate() to add details, widgets, and more. Explore the API on your own with our NerdGraph explorer! In this guide, you create a dashboard with a single page that contains a single widget—the visualization widget you described in the last section. Step 1 of 5 Build out a GraphQL mutation template based on the fields you need to describe your dashboard in dashboardCreate(): mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 0, dashboard: { name: \"\", pages: [ { name: \"\", widgets: [] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) } Copy Here, you've defined the template for a private dashboard. Now, it's time to fill in the details. Step 2 of 5 Look up your account ID and enter it for your accountId: mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1234567, dashboard: { name: \"\", pages: [ { name: \"\", widgets: [] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) } Copy Step 3 of 5 Select a name for your dashboard and its page: mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1234567, dashboard: { name: \"My Awesome Dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"One Page to Rule Them All\", widgets: [] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) } Copy Step 4 of 5 In widgets, place the widget object you created in the last section: mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1234567, dashboard: { name: \"My Awesome Dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"One Page to Rule Them All\", widgets: [ { title: \"My Awesome Visualization\", visualization: { id: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [ { accountId: 1234567, query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], fill: \"pink\", stroke: \"green\" } } ] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) } Copy Step 5 of 5 Finally, add the return fields to your mutation: mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1234567, dashboard: { name: \"My Awesome Dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"One Page to Rule Them All\", widgets: [ { title: \"My Awesome Visualization\", visualization: { id: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [ { accountId: 1234567, query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], fill: \"pink\", stroke: \"green\" } } ] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) { entityResult { guid } } } Copy Important Make sure you replace the IDs in your mutation query with ones that match your account, Nerdpack, and visualization. Now, you have a mutation ready to send to NerdGraph to create single-page dashboard with a widget for your custom visualization. As a result, you'll see the new dashboard's entity GUID. In the next section, you'll learn how to add your visualization to an existing dashboard. If that's not relevant to your goals, skip ahead to send your request to NerdGraph. Add your visualization to an existing dashboard To add your visualization widget to an existing dashboard, use NerdGraph's dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() mutation. The NerdGraph dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() mutation takes the following fields: Field Type Description guid String The entity GUID for the dashboard to which you're adding your widgets widgets Array: JSON The widgets to add to the dashboard page Tip You can also pass more fields to dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() to add details, widgets, and more. Explore the API on your own with our NerdGraph explorer! Step 1 of 4 Build out a GraphQL mutation template based on the fields you need to describe your dashboard in dashboardAddWidgetsToPage(): mutation { dashboardAddWidgetsToPage( guid: \"\" widgets: [] ) { errors { description } } } Copy Step 2 of 4 Look up your dashboard's GUID and enter it for guid: mutation { dashboardAddWidgetsToPage( guid: \"AbCdEFghIJkLMNo1PQRSTUVWXYZAbCD2Ef34GHI\" widgets: [] ) { errors { description } } } Copy Step 3 of 4 In widgets, place the widget object you created in Describe your visualization options with JSON: mutation { dashboardAddWidgetsToPage( guid: \"AbCdEFghIJkLMNo1PQRSTUVWXYZAbCD2Ef34GHI\" widgets: [ { visualization: { id: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [ { accountId: 1234567, query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], fill: \"pink\", stroke: \"green\" } }, ] ) } Copy Step 4 of 4 Finally, add the return fields to your mutation: mutation { dashboardAddWidgetsToPage( guid: \"AbCdEFghIJkLMNo1PQRSTUVWXYZAbCD2Ef34GHI\" widgets: [ { visualization: { id: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [ { accountId: 1234567, query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], fill: \"pink\", stroke: \"green\" } }, ] ) { errors { description } } } Copy Now, you have a mutation ready to send to NerdGraph to add your custom visualization to an existing dashboard. As a result, you'll see descriptions of any thrown errors to help you debug issues. The last thing you need to do is actually send your request to NerdGraph. Send your request to NerdGraph Send an HTTP request to NerdGraph with the payload you built in previous sections for the mutation that best suits your needs. There are many tools you can use to send an HTTP request, but in this guide, you learn how to communicate with NerdGraph using three specific tools: NerdGraph API explorer cURL New Relic CLI If you use another, you can adapt these methods for your favorite development tool. NerdGraph API explorer The NerdGraph API explorer is an implementation of GraphiQL that lets you explore the NerdGraph APIs. Step 1 of 4 Go to the NerdGraph API explorer. Step 2 of 4 Select or create a new API key: Step 3 of 4 In the center console, paste your mutation query: Important Make sure you replace the IDs in your mutation query with ones that match your account, Nerdpack, and visualization. Step 4 of 4 Press Execute Query and see the results in the right pane: If you successfully created a new dashboard, your response has an entity GUID. If you don't have an entity GUID, the response contains error messages to help you debug your query. If you added your visualization to an existing dashboard, you won't see errors in the response. If you do see error messages, use them to debug your query. Explore The NerdGraph API explorer lets you see other fields and change your query without typing everything manually. Use the left pane to explore NerdGraph. cURL cURL is a command line utility for making HTTP requests. Step 1 of 2 Select or create a New Relic user key. Copy this key, because you use it in the next step. Step 2 of 2 Make a request to NerdGraph, using cURL: bash Copy $ curl https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ > -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ > -H 'API-Key: <YOUR-USER-KEY>' \\ > --data-binary '{\"query\": \"mutation {dashboardCreate(dashboard: {name: \\\"My Awesome Dashboard\\\", pages: [{name: \\\"One Page to Rule Them All\\\", widgets: [{title: \\\"My Awesome Visualization\\\", visualization: {id: \\\"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\\\"}, rawConfiguration: {nrqlQueries: [{accountId: 3014918, query: \\\"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\\\"}], fill: \\\"pink\\\", stroke: \\\"green\\\"}}]}], permissions: PRIVATE}, accountId: <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID>) { entityResult { guid }}}\", \"variables\": \"\"}' Important Make sure you replace the IDs in your mutation query with ones that match your account, Nerdpack, and visualization. Here, you send a request to NerdGraph that has two headers, Content-Type and API-Key, and a binary message body containing one of the mutation queries you built in previous sections. If you prefer to use a UI-based client, like Postman, you can adapt this method to a format that your client supports. New Relic CLI The newrelic is a command line interface for reading and writing New Relic data. Step 1 of 2 If you haven't already, install newrelic by following the first two steps of our Get started with the New Relic CLI guide. Once you've done that, you will have newrelic installed and configured for making NerdGraph requests. Step 2 of 2 Make a NerdGraph request using newrelic nerdgraph query: bash Copy $ newrelic nerdgraph query 'mutation { $ dashboardCreate( $ accountId: 1234567, $ dashboard: { $ name: \"My Awesome Dashboard\", $ pages: [ $ { $ name: \"One Page to Rule Them All\", $ widgets: [ $ { $ title: \"My Awesome Visualization\", $ visualization: { $ id: \"de0b4768-1504-4818-a898-da7cd14f0bfb.my-awesome-visualization\" $ }, $ rawConfiguration: { $ nrqlQueries: [ $ { $ accountId: <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID>, $ query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" $ } $ ], $ fill: \"pink\", $ stroke: \"green\" $ } $ } $ ] $ }, $ ], $ permissions: PRIVATE $ } $ ) { $ entityResult { $ guid $ } $ } $ }' Important Make sure you replace the IDs in your mutation query with ones that match your account, Nerdpack, and visualization. View your new dashboard Now that you've built a dashboard with NerdGraph, it's time to check your work! Step 1 of 4 Go to New Relic. Step 2 of 4 Navigate to Dashboards: Step 3 of 4 Select your new dashboard: Step 4 of 4 View your dashboard: The dashboard you created has the name you passed in your mutation, \"My Awesome Dashboard\". It also has the configuration you sent in rawConfiguration, from the NRQL data query to the fill and stroke colors. Summary Congratulations!

      "body": "When you create a dashboard, you add a variety of charts to visualize your New Relic telemetry data. These charts, offered out-of-the-box, are customizable in that you can: Resize and arrange their positions in your dashboard Update their names, display options, and underlying data queries But sometimes the charts we include in the platform aren't enough for you to get the most from your data. When you want to visualize your data in a specific way that isn't possible with our charts, you can build a custom visualization. New Relic is programmable. This means that if the platform doesn't solve your specific problem, you can write and deploy your own code to fill in some of those gaps. One area where programmability is valuable is in visualizing your data. While New Relic offers all the telemetry data that your apps and services report and provides many different kinds of charts to present that data, you might need to create something entirely unique. With the New Relic One SDK, we've provided you all the tools you'll need to create your own visualizations. Build your custom visualization With the New Relic One SDK, you can create a Nerdpack, which houses your visualization code. This code consists of a React component, logic, data queries, and external dependencies. The SDK also provides a component library that you can use to make NerdGraph requests, access platform state context, and more. Your first visualization To build your first custom visualization, install the New Relic One SDK and make sure you have the latest version: bash Copy $ nr1 update Create a Nerdpack and a visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name custom-viz ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ...my-first-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-first-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization custom-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz/visualizations/custom-viz\" The visualization you created in the my-first-viz Nerdpack contains a default component to help you get started. Serve your visualization locally: bash Copy $ cd my-first-viz $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ custom-viz https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Important To view the locally served visualization, you must use the nerdpacks=local querystring. Enter values into the fields under Configure visualization properties and see how the chart changes: Resources Here is a list of resources for building custom visualizations: Build a custom visualization for dashboards (Guide) Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK (Guide) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Customize your visualization You have a lot of control over how your visualization operates. You can choose what properties of the visualization are customizable, such as colors, sizes, and how you present your legend. You can choose whether it presents New Relic data or data from an external source. You can even install and use third-party components to create a specific look: Resources Here is a list of resources for configuring custom visualizations: Configuration options (Documentation) Customize visualizations with configuration (Guide) Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (Video) Use your custom visualization During development, you can serve your visualization locally. Under Apps > Custom Visualizations, you can view and configure your visualization to see how your data looks, but you can't instantiate that chart and use it in your account: To do that, you need to publish it to the New Relic One catalog and subscribe to it from your account. Because custom visualizations are Nerdpack artifacts, you publish and subscribe to them the same way you publish and subscribe to New Relic One applications. Once you've done so, you can add your custom visualization to a dashboard: If you want to reuse your visualization to present different data or the same data in a new way, you can go back to Apps > Custom Visualizations, choose your visualization, configure another instance and add it to your dashboard: Resources Here is a list of resources for using custom visualizations: Add custom visualizations to your dashboards (Documentation) New Relic Dashboards and Custom Visualizations: Flexibility with Less Toil (Blog) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (Video)",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One app catalog. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in the New Relic One Catalog, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another. Step 4 of 4 In index.js, change your component's Radar.fillOpacity: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 } from 'recharts'; 10 import {Card, CardBody, HeadingText, NrqlQuery, Spinner, AutoSizer} from 'nr1'; 11 12 export default class MyAwesomeVisualizationVisualization extends React.Component { 13 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 14 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Before you begin Explore our custom visualization guides and build your first visualization.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type.

Step 1 of 3 Import Treemap from recharts: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 'Radar': 'radar', 24 'Treemap': 'treemap' 25 } 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

Step 3 of 3 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your visualization. The SegmentedControl and RadarChart are at the top of the view, but if you scroll down, you'll see your new Treemap: Switch between charts with your component's state Use state.selectedChart to determine which chart to show: the RadarChart or the Treemap. Step 1 of 1 Destructure this.state to access selectedChart as a separate constant. Then, compare selectedChart to CHART_TYPES.Radar. If they are the same, render a RadarChart. Otherwise, render a Treemap: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 'Radar': 'radar', 24 'Treemap': 'treemap' 25 } 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

      "body": "Understand the requirements for managing and using Nerdpacks in New Relic One. Capabilities at a glance Your ability to manage and use Nerdpacks depends on your user's: Model (original or New Relic One model) Type Role Whether you're on the original user model or the New Relic One user model, review the tables below for a summary of your Nerdpack capabilities. Original user model If your organization was created before July 30, 2020 and you haven't transitioned to our New Relic One pricing model, you're on the original pricing plan. Capabilities for our original user model differ from those of our new user model: Basic user Full user without the Nerdpack Manager add-on role Full user with the Nerdpack Manager add-on role Owner/Admin user Serve Nerdpacks yes yes yes yes Publish Nerdpacks no no yes yes Subscribe to Nerdpacks no no yes yes Tag Nerdpacks no no yes yes Use Nerdlets or visualizations created by your accounts no yes yes yes Use Nerdlets created by New Relic no* yes yes yes Use visualizations created by New Relic no yes yes yes * There are a few Nerdlets that basic users are allowed to use. See Basic users for more information. New Relic One user model If your organization is part of the New Relic One pricing model, the user types, privileges, and capabilities are different than those of our original user model: Basic user Full user Serve Nerdpacks yes yes Publish Nerdpacks no yes Subscribe to Nerdpacks no yes Tag Nerdpacks no yes Use Nerdlets or visualizations created by your accounts no yes Use Nerdlets created by New Relic no* yes Use visualizations created by New Relic no yes * There are a few Nerdlets that basic users are allowed to use. See Basic users for more information. Nerdpack permissions: Original user model Learn the differences between how basic users, full users, and admins can use and manage Nerdpacks in the original user model. Basic users If you're a basic user in the original user model, you're limited in your Nerdpack capabilities. You can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally. To publish, tag, subscribe to, and use your Nerdpacks, an admin must upgrade you to a full user. Tip If you're a basic user, you generally can't use any Nerdpacks. However, there are some Nerdlets that New Relic maintains that you can use. These are rare and there is currently no way for you to distinguish them in our web interface. And even if you can use a Nerdlet in a Nerdpack, you're never able to use custom visualizations. For this, you must be upgraded to a full user. Full users If you're a full user in the original user model, you either: Have the Nerdpack Manager add-on role Don't have the Nerdpack Manager add-on role The Nerdpack Manager role is required to publish, subscribe to, and tag Nerdpacks. So if you don't have the Nerdpack Manager role, you can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally and use Nerdpacks that your accounts have already been subscribed to. To publish, tag, or subscribe to a Nerdpack, an admin must upgrade you to a full user or grant you the Nerdpack Manager add-on role. Owner/Admin users If you're an owner or admin user, you can perform any of the Nerdpack capabilities. You can create, serve, publish, tag, subscribe to, and use any and all Nerdpack artifacts, both Nerdlets and visualizations. This includes Nerdpacks built by New Relic or by one of your accounts. Nerdpack permissions: New Relic One user model Learn the differences between how basic users and full users can use and manage Nerdpacks in the New Relic One user model. Basic users If you're a basic user in the New Relic One user model, you're limited in your Nerdpack capabilities. You can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally. To publish, tag, subscribe to, and use your Nerdpacks, an admin must upgrade you to a full user. Tip If you're a basic user, you generally can't use any Nerdpacks. However, there are some Nerdlets that New Relic maintains that you can use. These are rare and there is currently no way for you to distinguish them in our web interface. And even if you can use a Nerdlet in a Nerdpack, you're never able to use custom visualizations. For this, you must be upgraded to a full user. Full users If you're a full user in the New Relic One user model, you either: Have the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege Don't have the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege The Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege is required to publish, subscribe to, and tag Nerdpacks. So if you don't have the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege, you can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally and use Nerdpacks that your accounts have already been subscribed to. To publish, tag, or subscribe to your Nerdpack, an admin must grant you the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege. Tip The Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege is included in both the User and Admin groups, the only groups available by default. So in most cases, you'll have the ability to manage Nerdpacks as a full user. However, if you're a full user assigned to a custom group that doesn't include the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege, you won't be able to manage Nerdpacks. Master/Sub-account Capabilities Some accounts, called master accounts, have sub-accounts that report data back up to them. This organizational hierarchy affects Nerdpack capabilities. In general, the flow of control moves downstream: In this example scenario A, the master account publishes a Nerdpack. This means that all three accounts, Master, Account 1, and Account 2, can subscribe to it. If you subscribe the master account to the Nerdpack, then users of all three accounts can use it. If you subscribe Account 1 to it, only Account 1 users can use it, because neither Master nor Account 2 is downstream in the hierarchy. In scenario B, the sub-account, Account 1, publishes a Nerdpack, so you can't use or subscribe to the Nerdpack from Master or Account 2.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Create a Nerdpack, before starting this one. When you build a New Relic One application, it's valuable to view it on the platform. This helps you design, implement, and debug your application in the environment it will eventually be published to. With nr1, you can launch a development server that hosts your application so that New Relic One can present it to you. Step 1 of 4 From inside the Nerdpack's root directory, serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve When the Nerdpack has succeeded building and your application is ready to view, you'll see a message with a link to New Relic One: bash Copy ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! Notice the appended query parameter nerdpacks=local. This query parameter tells New Relic to show locally served Nerdpacks. Tip If you don't see your application on the New Relic platform, make sure you've included nerdpacks=local in your querystring! Step 2 of 4 Navigate to the provided url. From the home page, select Apps to view New Relic One applications: Step 3 of 4 Under the Your apps section, find your launcher, called \"A/B Test Launcher\": Step 4 of 4 Select your launcher to see your root Nerdlet and its default welcome message: Tip Here, you've seen how to access your Nerdlet from a launcher. If you want your Nerdlet closer to your data, you can also attach your Nerdlet to New Relic entities. Congratulations, you've served your first New Relic One application! Notice, in the command's output, that the server reloads when you change files in your Nerdpack.

Agent versions and protocols Make sure you meet these requirements for your agent's version, protocols, interfaces, or message queue libraries. If you are using a protocol that is not listed here, you will not see a connection between your applications. Agent version Notes C SDK Use distributed tracing. Go 1.11 or higher HTTP, HTTPS Java 3.9.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPs, JMS 1.1, RabbitMQ The Java agent also supports several message queue libraries, including those that use the JMS 1.1 interface. .NET 4.2 or higher HTTP, and supported .NET messaging systems Node.js 2.0.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, RabbitMQ PHP 4.19.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, and supported PHP message queuing systems Python 2.38.0.31 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, and supported Python message queuing systems Ruby 4.3.0 or higher HTTP, HTTPS, RabbitMQ Config file requirements In general, New Relic's cross application tracing feature is enabled by default. Requirements to change your configuration file vary, depending on your New Relic agent: C SDK (not supported) Go (not supported) Java .NET Node.js (no specific config file settings needed for Node.js) PHP Python Ruby High throughput apps Cross application traces rely on transaction events to associate related transactions. If you have a high throughput application, your agent may reach the maximum number of events that it can record in a minute and will fall back to sampling events. If a transaction’s events are sampled, you may see an incomplete cross application trace, including sometimes only the transactions that you are focused on. If your application has high throughput, some cross application traces will appear incomplete, sometimes with no links. Try viewing a different transaction trace. To reduce or eliminate sampling, you can also adjust the number of transaction events stored in your agent configuration. High throughput apps Troubleshooting tips Java From the transaction_events stanza, adjust the setting for max_samples_stored. Ruby Adjust the setting for analytics_events.max_samples_stored. Proxies If you expect to see a cross application trace link but it consistently does not appear, there may be a proxy or broker between your application’s communication. Cross application tracing relies on HTTP headers and JMS properties being passed from one application to other. HTTP proxies and message brokers sometimes strip those headers. Multi-threaded processing (Java) If one or more of your Java applications uses an async or \"reactive\" programming model, a transaction's activity may span across multiple threads. New Relic supports the Play framework and Servlet Async but not all async frameworks. For unsupported frameworks, activity on other threads is not reported as part of the transaction. Calls to other applications will not be traced. Multiple accounts Currently cross application traces do not cross New Relic accounts. If you have multiple New Relic accounts (including child accounts), you will only see traces for applications within one account. Our distributed tracing feature does cross account boundaries.",

      "body": "New Relic APM's cross application tracing lets you link transactions between your APM-monitored applications. What is cross application tracing? Important Instead of using cross application tracing, we recommend our distributed tracing features. Distributed tracing is an improvement on the cross application tracing feature and is recommended for large, distributed systems. New Relic APM's cross application traces link transactions between APM apps in your service-oriented architecture (SOA). This is useful, for example, to identify performance problems between your own application (the \"calling\" app) and any internal or external services (the \"called\" app), such as traffic to internal services. This helps you to: Spot bottlenecks in your cross application call flows. Understand from end to end how specific transactions are used by other applications and services. Diagnose problems faster and enhance collaboration across teams. Security considerations Cross application tracing relies on three HTTP headers in order to exchange information between the calling and called applications. The first two (X-NewRelic-ID and X-NewRelic-Transaction) appear as HTTP request headers in outgoing requests sent by an instrumented application.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add version descriptions, before starting this one. In this course, you’re building an A/B test application in New Relic. The application presents a lot of data, through its charts, about the effectiveness of each design version you’re testing on your demo website. Ultimately, you’ll be able to use that data to decide which design is most effective and show that design to every user who visits your site. In this lesson, you’ll build a form into your application that lets you choose which design you want to show to every user of your site. Before writing any code, look at your design guide to review the section you’re going to build: This new section has three main components: A heading with instructional copy: \"Pick a version to end the test\" A component that you use to crown the winning version of the A/B test A button to confirm the winner that you selected Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-end-test-section/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named end-test.js: bash Copy $ touch end-test.js Step 3 of 10 In this new file, create a VersionSelector component to encapsulate a Select and its SelectItem child components: import React from 'react'; import { Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy VersionSelector renders a Select component with two choices. In each SelectItem, you specify a value prop. In this case, you use 'A' to represent version A and 'B' to represent version B. Step 4 of 10 Create another component for a Button you'll use to make your test as ended: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy This looks trivial, but it will encapsulate button logic as you iterate on your app code. Step 5 of 10 Create a final component for the entire section you'll use to mark the end of your test: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you create a Grid with three items. First, you create a GridItem that contains a HeadingText and spans all 12 columns. In the next row, you have two items: The VersionSelector component you created in the previous step A Button which reads \"End test\" These items each span one column, but instead of using columnSpan, they use a combination of columnStart and columnEnd to specify which columns they cover. Step 6 of 10 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, add EndTestSection to your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. However, you need to make a few improvements to this code. When you select a version, the selected value in the component doesn't change. You must control the value that Select displays using its value prop and onChange event handler. In the next lesson, you’ll update your code to persist your version choice in the Select component. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Persist the selected version.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Install and configure the New Relic One CLI, before starting this one. A Nerdpack is a package that contains all the files that make up a New Relic One application or visualization. Nerdpacks include files for metadata, Nerdlets, assets, and more. To create a Nerdpack, use the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack When nr1 prompts for a component name, use \"ab-test\" and watch the tool create the foundations of your Nerdpack. Once it's finished, explore the files it created for you. Root directory At the root level, you have a directory called ab-test. Everything inside this directory is part of the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls ab-test README.md nerdlets nr1.json package.json launchers node_modules package-lock.json Readme.md provides instructions for creating Nerdpack elements and serving your application locally. This and nr1 --help are useful if you forget how to interact with your Nerdpack using the command line tool. Javascript files package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules are important for running your JavaScript application, but aren't unique to Nerdpacks. You can learn about these modules from JavaScript courses should you need to tweak them. For now, take a look at nr1.json, one of the most relevant files in this directory. Metadata file nr1.json is the Nerdpack's metadata file, containing a schema type, unique identifier, a display name, and a description. Since you’re building a New Relic One application for running and analyzing A/B tests, update the package's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and set the description to \"A/B test your application using New Relic One\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"311bcd0c-f7eb-4285-afed-4219179bf91d\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"A/B test your application using New Relic One.\" } nr1.json Copy It's good to describe your application's purpose, especially if you're going to publish your application for others to use. Next, look at the launchers and nerdlets subdirectories. Launchers launchers is a directory because you can create multiple launchers for your New Relic One application. nr1 create only created one launcher for your Nerdpack and called it \"ab-test-launcher\". Inside its directory, there are two files: icon.png is an image that represents the application nr1.json is the launcher's metadata file Use \"A/B Test Launcher\" for the launcher's displayName and \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\" for the description in nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"ab-test-launcher\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test Launcher\", \"description\": \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\" } launchers/ab-test-launcher/nr1.json Copy Notice that the launcher has a rootNerdletId. This identifies the Nerdlet that the launcher opens when it's selected. This Nerdpack has only one Nerdlet, called ab-test-nerdlet, but some Nerdpacks may have multiple. Make sure that you set the rootNerdletId to the Nerdlet you want the launcher to open. Nerdlets The nerdlets directory contains all the Nerdlets that make up your New Relic One application. Since ab-test-nerdlet is the only Nerdlet in this Nerdpack, there is only one subdirectory. In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, there are three files: index.js is the JavaScript file that contains your Nerdlet component styles.scss holds the Sass stylesheet for your Nerdlet nr1.json contains the Nerdlet's metadata Update your Nerdlet's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and description to \"Control and view results of your A/B test\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"Control and view results of your A/B test\" } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Now, you've customized your Nerdpack, Nerdlet, and launcher with informative display names and descriptions, but what does your application actually do? Check out index.js to see what your default Nerdlet looks like: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, ab-test-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you have AbTestNerdletNerdlet, which nr1 created for you. It's a React component that renders a first-level welcome heading. Because this is the root Nerdlet, as specified in your launcher's nr1.json file, when you click on your launcher in the New Relic platform, the launcher will open a view that displays this heading. Tip In this lesson, you used nr1 create to create a Nerdpack, complete with a launcher and a Nerdlet. If you want to create another Nerdlet or Launcher in your Nerdpack, you can also do that with nr1 create: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdlet $ nr1 create --type launcher You can even skip the --type flag and select an option from a list: bash Copy $ nr1 create ? What kind of component do you want to create? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit. nerdpack ❯ nerdlet - create a/an Nerdlet artifact inside your Nerdpack. launcher catalog visualization In the next lesson, you'll learn how to serve your Nerdpack locally and see your app in action!

So far, it consists of a single line chart, which represents the number of subscriptions your newsletter receives from each version of your website. To understand what you’ll build in this lesson, review the design guide to remember what charts come next: In the design, there are two pie charts beneath the line chart that you’ve already created. One represents the distribution of users who receive version A and version B. The other represents the distribution of successful requests from users who got version A and version B. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-pie-charts/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add two new Javascript files: total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js bash Copy $ touch total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js Step 3 of 9 In total-subscriptions.js, create a component, called TotalSubscriptions, which renders mocked subscription data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Notice that the series data is formatted differently for PieChart than it was for LineChart. Because PieChart uses unidimensional data, its series only take y-values. Step 4 of 9 In total-cancellations.js, create a component, called TotalCancellations, which renders mocked cancellation data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new components and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One app catalog. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance.

      "info": "Build a \"Hello, World!\" app and publish it to New Relic One",
      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in the New Relic One Catalog, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the New Relic One catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published to the catalog, you can view it by visiting the Apps page of New Relic: From the catalog UI, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top right of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app in the catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

      "body": "Subscribe to a Nerdpack to use it in the New Relic platform. Unsubscribe from Nerdpacks you no longer use. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions To subscribe to a Nerdpack, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can subscribe to them: Publish your Nerdpack Tag your Nerdpack if it's published and doesn't yet have a tag Subscribe to a Nerdpack Subscribe to a published Nerdpack, with either the web UI or the nr1 CLI, to use it in your account. Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack under New Relic One catalog: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the New Relic One catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel. Tip nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:unset. Read the nr1 subscription:unset documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:unset --help Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you subscribe to a Nerdpack, you may run into issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

Starting out with NerdGraph If you're new to NerdGraph and GraphQL, you may want to first read our Introduction to NerdGraph. If you’re already familiar with the dashboards API, you can read Create dashboards with NerdGraph. When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. Find the NerdGraph API explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Operations We have defined a granular GraphQL API that lets you execute different dashboard operations depending on their goal and scope. Dashboard CRUD operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes actor > entity() query Get dashboard operation. You can get all dashboard and widget data for a given dashboard entity GUID. dashboardCreate() mutation Create dashboard operation. You can create a dashboard attached to a specific account by specifying all its elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardUpdate() mutation Update dashboard operation. You can update an existing dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. You need to specify the complete, updated dashboard elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardDelete() mutation Delete dashboard operation. You can delete an existing dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. This operation executes a logical delete that lets you recover your dashboard. dashboardUndelete() mutation Undelete dashboard operation. You can recover a previously deleted dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. Dashboard page operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes dashboardUpdatePage() mutation Update dashboard page operation. You can update one page of an existing dashboard given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the complete, updated dashboard page elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardUpdateWidgetsInPage() mutation Update widgets operation. You can update a set of existing widgets of a dashboard page given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the set of widgets to be updated and their complete configuration. dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() mutation Add widgets operation. You can add a set of new widgets to a dashboard page given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the set of new widgets and their complete configuration. Other operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes dashboardCreateSnapshotUrl() mutation Create dashboard page snapshot operation. You can create a public URL for a given dashboard page entity GUID. The dashboard page can then be accessed in the form of a static snapshot in the resulting public URL. actor > dashboard > liveUrls() query List all live URLs operation. You can get the complete list of live URLs you have access to. A live URL is a mechanism that allows you to share dashboard pages and widgets publicly with up-to-date or live data. dashboardWidgetRevokeLiveUrl() mutation Revoke widget live URL operation. You can revoke a previously created live URL of a widget. As a result, the live URL will become unavailable to the public. Limits We have limited the values you can set to some of the dashboard properties. This allows us to keep dashboards in good shape while boosting their usability. Dashboard limits Limit Value Maximum number of pages in a dashboard 20 Maximum length of a dashboard name 255 Maximum length of a dashboard description 1024 Dashboard page limits Limit Value Maximum number of widgets in a dashboard page 40 Maximum length of a dashboard page name 255 Maximum length of a dashboard page description 1024 Widget limits Limit Value Maximum length of a widget title 255 Maximum number of entities linked to a widget 1 Maximum number of queries in a widget 20 Maximum layout column of a widget 12 Minimum layout column of a widget 1 Minimum layout row of a widget 1 Maximum layout width of a widget 12 Minimum layout width of a widget 1 Maximum layout height of a widget 8 Minimum layout height of a widget 1 Errors as first class citizens All dashboard mutations offer a way to ask for errors when being executed. This means that you can perform your dashboard mutations and check the response in order to detect expected potential issues. Every error has a type and a description to help you identify what’s the source of the problem. Errors as part of every mutation response mutation { dashboardMutation(guid: \"MY_EXISTING_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { mutationResult { result } errors { description type } } } Copy Keep in mind that these are expected errors that we are aware of in advance. You should also check for unexpected errors that will be returned in the standard GraphQL errors field.",

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that each require their own type of API key to use. This resource describes our API keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. Manage API keys in UI Here's a direct link to the API keys UI page. To find this from the New Relic UI: From the account dropdown, select API keys. Overview of API keys The table below summarizes our available API keys and their uses. Important Some keys are able to be used by more than one API. If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. Key type What it's for Where to access User key (Also known as a \"personal API key\") Used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints (dependent on user permissions). API keys UI License key Allows ingestion of data from APM agents, the infrastructure agent, and some other data-ingest APIs. API keys UI Insights insert key (Also known as a \"Insert key\") Allows ingestion of events via HTTPS request from our metric, log, trace, and event APIs and the tools that use those APIs. Go to the API keys UI and click Insights insert key. Browser key Allows ingestion of browser monitoring data. API keys UI Mobile key (aka \"mobile app token\") Allows mobile monitoring data to be sent to New Relic. See Mobile app token. REST API key Note: we recommend using the user key instead because it has fewer limitations. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Go to the API keys UI and click REST API key. Admin API key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. For more information, see Admin key and User key below. API keys UI (will appear as user keys) Insights query key (aka \"Query key\") This key allows use of the Insights query API. Note: we now recommend using NerdGraph to query New Relic data. Go to the API keys UI and click Insights query key. User key New Relic user keys (previously referred to as \"personal API keys\") are required for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API), which allows you to query most New Relic data and do some types of configuration. User keys also let you use our REST API, with restrictions based on your permissions. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a user key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select User. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key. In the Notes field, add relevant details about the key. Click Create. Edit a user key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the user key you want to edit, click ... and select Edit. Make your changes and click Update key. Delete a user key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the user key you want to delete, click ... and select Delete. Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. Tip In December 2020, user keys supplanted Admin API keys. For details, see Admin API key. License key New Relic license keys allow the ingestion of data from APM agents, the infrastructure agent, and some other data-ingest APIs. If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required or recommended. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a license key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select License. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key. In the Notes field, add relevant details about the key. Click Create. Edit a license key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the license key you want to edit, click ... and select Edit. Make your changes and click Update key. Delete a license API key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the license key you want to delete, click ... and select Delete. Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. Important You can't manage or delete an original license key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Browser key The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a browser key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select Browser. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key. In the Notes field, add relevant details about the key. Click Create. Edit a browser key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the browser API key you want to edit, click ... and select Edit. Make your changes and click Update key. Delete a browser key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the browser API key you want to delete, click ... and select Delete. Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. Important You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. You can use a REST API key with our REST API and the API Explorer. For accounts that have sub-accounts, each sub-account must use its own REST API key. Requirements: Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. Activate or change REST API key Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Click Regenerate REST API key. Click (Show key) to view your account's new REST API key. Copy your account's REST API key to use with New Relic's REST API. View REST API keys To view REST API keys: Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Click (Show key) to view your account's new REST API key. Delete REST API key To delete your account's REST API key: Before you delete an API key, make sure you have the correct account or sub-account. Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Select the delete icon for the REST API key. Confirm the deletion by typing DELETION IS FOREVER in the text field. Select Delete. Insights insert key The Insights insert key (aka the \"Insert key\") is required for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. Generate an Insights insert key Go to the API keys UI and select Insights insert keys. Next to the Insert keys heading, select the button. A cURL command containing your insert key will appear, as well as NRQL query field. Edit the NRQL query field. Add comments in the Notes field if desired. Click Save your notes. Edit or delete an Insights insert key Go to the API keys UI and select Insights insert keys. Under Insert Keys, find the key you want to modify. Select Edit or Delete. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. Generate an Insights query key You must have access to the UIs you plan to query and the correct permissions in order to register or modify this key. Important Insights query keys are generated per account; they're not associated with a specific user. This means that any user in an account with access to a query key can use it. To register this key: Go to the API keys UI and select Insights query keys. Next to the Query Keys heading, select the button. A cURL command containing your insert key will appear, as well as NRQL query field. Edit the NRQL query field. Add comments in the Notes field if desired. Click Save your notes. Edit or delete an Insights query key To edit or delete this key: Go to the API keys UI page and select Insights query keys. Under Query Keys, find the key you want to modify. Select Edit or Delete. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily.",

To learn more about this transition and new features, see the Insights to New Relic One migration guide. The Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated in July of 2021. Until then, if you are using Insights Dashboard API, you should attempt to switch over to using NerdGraph. Some details on this deprecation: You can continue to use your Insights insert API key with the Dashboards API, or you can create a new user API key (read more about API keys). Every user who wants to use NerdGraph needs their own user API key. The REST API for Insights queries is not affected by this change and won't be deprecated. For more information about which key to use with our APIs, see our documentation about . When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. Starting out with NerdGraph If you're new to NerdGraph and GraphQL, you may want to first read our Introduction to NerdGraph and some of Create dashboards with NerdGraph. The NerdGraph API explorer is located at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Operations mapping table The table below maps every Insights API operation to the new dashboards API. Insights API operation NerdGraph API query/mutation Notes List (GET) entitySearch() View a paginated list of dashboards that match the filter. Show (GET) entity() View an existing dashboard given its entity guid. Create (POST) dashboardCreate() Create a new dashboard. Update (PUT) dashboardUpdate() Update an existing dashboard given its entity guid. Delete (DELETE) dashboardDelete() Delete an existing dashboard given its entity guid. Dashboard properties mapping table For more information about all the fields in the new dashboards GraphQL schema, have a look at NerdGraph's GraphiQL explorer. The table below maps dashboard properties from the Insights API to the new dashboards API.

Visualizations mapping table We have simplified our widget visualizations by grouping the ones that were in fact the same but obtained through different types of queries. For instance, a line widget is plotted the same way regardless of the type of query: old line_chart vs. comparison_line_chart in Insights.

By using the NerdGraph API explorer, you can discover GraphQL types and fields, along with a brief explanation. We want to facilitate your migration from the Insights API to the new New Relic One dashboards API. Find below some examples that illustrate how the old REST endpoints map to the new GraphQL queries or mutations. List (GET) -> entitySearch query Dashboards in New Relic One embrace the concept of entity. They are now another entity in New Relic’s entity ecosystem. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. List all dashboard entities you have access to { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by name { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {name: \"My dashboard\"}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s email { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD, tags: {key: \"createdBy\", value: \"email@domain.com\"}}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s user id { actor { entitySearch(query: \"type ='DASHBOARD' and ownerId = '2357322'\") { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy Show (GET) -> entity query In order to get information on a dashboard, all you need is to provide its unique entity identifier or entity guid. Then you can access all the dashboard properties that you are interested in by adding them in the GraphQL query. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Get dashboard info given its entity guid { actor { entity(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { ... on DashboardEntity { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } } Copy Create (POST) -> dashboardCreate mutation Operations that mutate the state of the system are mutations in GraphQL APIs. You can create a dashboard by providing the required input for the dashboardCreate mutation. Although GraphQL APIs aim to be self-explanatory, Nerdgraph docs can help you with some information about the fields, like the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Create dashboard with two pages and two widgets per page mutation { dashboardCreate(accountId: 1, dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.markdown\" }, title: \"My markdown widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { text: \"#My markdown\" } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.billboard\" }, title: \"My billboard widget with thresholds\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" }], thresholds: [{ alertSeverity: WARNING, value: 650 }, { alertSeverity: CRITICAL, value: 1500 }] } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Update (PUT) -> dashboardUpdate mutation The dashboardUpdate mutation allows you to update an existing dashboard by providing the existing dashboard guid and the new configuration. Similarly to creating a dashboard, the mutation tries to be self-explanatory, but you can look up the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Update previously created dashboard to 1 page and 1 widget per page mutation { dashboardUpdate(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\" dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Delete (DELETE) -> dashboardDelete mutation The dashboardDelete mutation allows you to delete an existing dashboard by providing its entity guid. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Delete previously created dashboard mutation { dashboardDelete(guid:\"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { status errors { type description } } } Copy",

      "body": "Publish your Nerdpack, whether it's still in development, ready for testing, or stable, to share it with others. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions When you publish your Nerdpack, it's registered with the New Relic One catalog. From there, some users can subscribe to your Nerdpack. Subscribing users need to have: Access to the account that published the Nerdpack The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Update your package version You can only publish a package version to the catalog one time. For example, you can't publish two instances of version 1.0.0. So, each time you want to deploy a new version of your code, you need to increment its version in the Nerdpack's package.json file: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy Tip Nerdpack versions follow semantic versioning. Read the documentation to learn more. Generate a UUID for your Nerdpack If you built your Nerdpack from scratch with nr1 create --type nerdpack, then your Nerdpack has a unique identifier. Find this identifier in the root directory's nr1.json file: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"DemoApp\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack demo-app\" } nr1.json Copy This ID must be unique to your Nerdpack when you publish it to the catalog. The platform will reject your Nerdpack if it recognizes the ID. So, if you cloned an existing Nerdpack or are otherwise using open source code, generate a new UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --generate --force Tip Read the nr1 nerdpack:uuid documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --help Publish your Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish If you've successfully published your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This output describes the published Nerdpack. First, it states the Nerdpack's ID (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890). Then, its version (1.0.0). Finally, its version tag (STABLE). You already managed your Nerdpack's ID and version, but the version tag is new. To manage your Nerdpack's versions, you can tag them with an arbitrary tag. For example, if a version is still in development, you can tag it with a DEV tag. If the version moves to a QA phase, you can tag it with QA. If it's ready for production, you can tag it with STABLE. Tip Read our tag guide to learn more. Use the -t or --tag option to publish your Nerdpack with a tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag DEV As you saw in the nr1 nerdpack:publish output, if you don't pass a tag, nr1 applies the STABLE tag automatically. However, you can tell it to not apply any tags to a release with the -T or --skip-tag option: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --skip-tag You can also perform a dry run to make sure you publish your Nerdpack the way you want to: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --dry-run Step 2 of 4 Once you've successfully published your Nerdpack, go to New Relic: Because you're going to view a published Nerdpack, rather than a locally served one, you don't need to pass the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to Apps: Whether you published a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Apps. Step 4 of 4 Find your published Nerdpack under New Relic One catalog: Notice the Custom indicator on its UI tile. Use this to distinguish between published Nerdpacks and locally-served Nerdpacks. Tip Only Nerdpacks with tagged versions are shown under New Relic One catalog. So, if you published without a tag or removed a tag from your published Nerdpack, you won't see it in the catalog. Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you publish your Nerdpack, you may come across issues. Whether you can't publish your Nerdpack due to some issue with your code or you can't find your Nerdpack in the catalog, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your command When you attempt to publish your Nerdpack, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. For example: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack DemoApp (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890) › Error: There is already a Nerdpack with given id & version. › Code: 409 It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --verbose Reveal your published Nerdpack information If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, it may not be tagged. Remember, at least one version of your published Nerdpack must have a tag for it to show on the Apps page. See more information about your published Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:info: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 3014918 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 3 hours ago In this example, there is one published version, but it isn't tagged. You can tag a published version with: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --from-version=1.0.0 --tag=DEV Now, if you refresh your browser page, you should see your Nerdpack on Apps. Tip Read our nr1 nerdpack:tag documentation to learn more. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you publish your Nerdpack, only users who can access your account can see your published Nerdpack. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic but you know it's published, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same.",

Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack under New Relic One catalog: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the New Relic One catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel. Tip nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:unset. Read the nr1 subscription:unset documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:unset --help Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you subscribe to a Nerdpack, you may run into issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

Then the version will be \"1.2.3-abc\". --profile=profile the authentication profile you want to use --verbose adds extra information to the output Description Runs a webpack process to assemble your Nerdpack into javascript and css bundles. As many other CLI commands, it should be run at the package.json level of your Nerdpack. It will search for nr1.json files in your subdirectories, validate them, and try to build them. This also runs nr1 nerdpack:validate before starting the build process. nr1 nerdpack:clean Removes all built artifacts Usage bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:clean Options --profile=profile the authentication profile you want to use --verbose adds extra information to the output Description Cleans and removes the content and the development folders (dist/, tmp/) nr1 nerdpack:clone Clones a nerdpack from a git repository Usage bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:clone Options -f, --force Replace destination folder if it exists -p, --path=path Directory where to clone (defaults to the repository name) -r, --repo=repo (required) Repository location (either an HTTPS or SSH path) --profile=profile the authentication profile you want to use --verbose adds extra information to the output Description Given a git repository, it performs all the actions so that you can start using it. This includes, in order: Clone the repository Set the repository as remote upstream Install all of its dependencies (using npm) Generate a new UUID using your profile, and commit it nr1 nerdpack:info Shows the state of your nerdpack in the new relic's registry Usage bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Options -a, --all show all versions -i, --nerdpack-id=nerdpack-id get info from the specified Nerdpack instead of local one --profile=profile the authentication profile you want to use --verbose adds extra information to the output Description The default amount of versions shown is 10 but all versions can be shown if the --all (or -a) flag is used nr1 nerdpack:publish Publish this nerdpack Usage bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Options -B, --skip-build skip the previous build process -T, --skip-tag do not tag the version -t, --tag=tag [default: STABLE] --dry-run publish process without actually publishing anything. --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path [default: extra-metadata.json] specify a json file path with extra metadata --prerelease=prerelease if specified, the value will be appended to the current version of generated files. ie: --prerelease=abc. Then the version will be \"1.2.3-abc\". --profile=profile the authentication profile you want to use --verbose adds extra information to the output Description This command will build and upload your Nerdpack to the registry. If no additional parameters are passed in, this command will automatically tag the nerdpack version as STABLE. If you want to disable this behavior, pass the --skip-tag flag to the command.

Basic users If you're a basic user in the original user model, you're limited in your Nerdpack capabilities. You can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally. To publish, tag, subscribe to, and use your Nerdpacks, an admin must upgrade you to a full user. Tip If you're a basic user, you generally can't use any Nerdpacks. However, there are some Nerdlets that New Relic maintains that you can use. These are rare and there is currently no way for you to distinguish them in our web interface. And even if you can use a Nerdlet in a Nerdpack, you're never able to use custom visualizations. For this, you must be upgraded to a full user. Full users If you're a full user in the original user model, you either: Have the Nerdpack Manager add-on role Don't have the Nerdpack Manager add-on role The Nerdpack Manager role is required to publish, subscribe to, and tag Nerdpacks. So if you don't have the Nerdpack Manager role, you can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally and use Nerdpacks that your accounts have already been subscribed to. To publish, tag, or subscribe to a Nerdpack, an admin must upgrade you to a full user or grant you the Nerdpack Manager add-on role. Owner/Admin users If you're an owner or admin user, you can perform any of the Nerdpack capabilities. You can create, serve, publish, tag, subscribe to, and use any and all Nerdpack artifacts, both Nerdlets and visualizations. This includes Nerdpacks built by New Relic or by one of your accounts. Nerdpack permissions: New Relic One user model Learn the differences between how basic users and full users can use and manage Nerdpacks in the New Relic One user model. Basic users If you're a basic user in the New Relic One user model, you're limited in your Nerdpack capabilities. You can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally. To publish, tag, subscribe to, and use your Nerdpacks, an admin must upgrade you to a full user. Tip If you're a basic user, you generally can't use any Nerdpacks. However, there are some Nerdlets that New Relic maintains that you can use. These are rare and there is currently no way for you to distinguish them in our web interface. And even if you can use a Nerdlet in a Nerdpack, you're never able to use custom visualizations. For this, you must be upgraded to a full user. Full users If you're a full user in the New Relic One user model, you either: Have the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege Don't have the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege The Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege is required to publish, subscribe to, and tag Nerdpacks. So if you don't have the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege, you can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally and use Nerdpacks that your accounts have already been subscribed to. To publish, tag, or subscribe to your Nerdpack, an admin must grant you the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege. Tip The Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege is included in both the User and Admin groups, the only groups available by default. So in most cases, you'll have the ability to manage Nerdpacks as a full user. However, if you're a full user assigned to a custom group that doesn't include the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege, you won't be able to manage Nerdpacks. Master/Sub-account Capabilities Some accounts, called master accounts, have sub-accounts that report data back up to them. This organizational hierarchy affects Nerdpack capabilities. In general, the flow of control moves downstream: In this example scenario A, the master account publishes a Nerdpack. This means that all three accounts, Master, Account 1, and Account 2, can subscribe to it. If you subscribe the master account to the Nerdpack, then users of all three accounts can use it. If you subscribe Account 1 to it, only Account 1 users can use it, because neither Master nor Account 2 is downstream in the hierarchy. In scenario B, the sub-account, Account 1, publishes a Nerdpack, so you can't use or subscribe to the Nerdpack from Master or Account 2.",

Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions To publish your Nerdpack and update its catalog information, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can update their catalog information. Update your Nerdpack's catalog metadata After you've published your Nerdpack to the New Relic One catalog, update the Nerdpack's metadata to let users know all about your Nerdlets or visualizations. Step 1 of 9 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 9 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 9 Find your published Nerdpack under New Relic One catalog: Notice that there is no information on the Apps or details page other than the Nerdpack's name and the brief description found in nr1.json: There are no screenshots, icons, details, or what's new features. To add these, your Nerdpack needs a catalog directory. Step 4 of 9 From the root of your Nerdpack, create a catalog directory to house your Nerdpack's screenshots and metadata: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog ✔ Component created successfully! catalog is available at \"./catalog\" Inside your catalog directory, you'll find specific files and directories for portraying information about your Nerdpack to your users: bash Copy $ ls catalog README.md additionalInfo.md config.json documentation.md screenshots File Description README.md A markdown file that instructs you how to use the information and metadata in catalog config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application.

Step 1 of 7 Update the icon.png in the root of your Nerdpack. This icon is used in the catalog and the Nerdpack's detail page. Step 2 of 7 If you're building a Nerdpack with one or more launchers, update the icon.png in each of your launcher's subfolders. Step 3 of 7 Update your package.json version: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.1\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"f2dbc999-e9a3-49b9-933d-5a704c6750bd\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy This allows you to publish a new version of your Nerdpack.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Create a Nerdpack, before starting this one. When you build a New Relic One application, it's valuable to view it on the platform. This helps you design, implement, and debug your application in the environment it will eventually be published to. With nr1, you can launch a development server that hosts your application so that New Relic One can present it to you. Step 1 of 4 From inside the Nerdpack's root directory, serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve When the Nerdpack has succeeded building and your application is ready to view, you'll see a message with a link to New Relic One: bash Copy ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! Notice the appended query parameter nerdpacks=local. This query parameter tells New Relic to show locally served Nerdpacks. Tip If you don't see your application on the New Relic platform, make sure you've included nerdpacks=local in your querystring! Step 2 of 4 Navigate to the provided url. From the home page, select Apps to view New Relic One applications: Step 3 of 4 Under the Your apps section, find your launcher, called \"A/B Test Launcher\": Step 4 of 4 Select your launcher to see your root Nerdlet and its default welcome message: Tip Here, you've seen how to access your Nerdlet from a launcher. If you want your Nerdlet closer to your data, you can also attach your Nerdlet to New Relic entities. Congratulations, you've served your first New Relic One application! Notice, in the command's output, that the server reloads when you change files in your Nerdpack. Give it a try by updating nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>A/B test results</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Your app automatically refreshes to show the new heading: Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] }, \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Understand the requirements for managing and using Nerdpacks in New Relic One. Capabilities at a glance Your ability to manage and use Nerdpacks depends on your user's: Model (original or New Relic One model) Type Role Whether you're on the original user model or the New Relic One user model, review the tables below for a summary of your Nerdpack capabilities. Original user model If your organization was created before July 30, 2020 and you haven't transitioned to our New Relic One pricing model, you're on the original pricing plan. Capabilities for our original user model differ from those of our new user model: Basic user Full user without the Nerdpack Manager add-on role Full user with the Nerdpack Manager add-on role Owner/Admin user Serve Nerdpacks yes yes yes yes Publish Nerdpacks no no yes yes Subscribe to Nerdpacks no no yes yes Tag Nerdpacks no no yes yes Use Nerdlets or visualizations created by your accounts no yes yes yes Use Nerdlets created by New Relic no* yes yes yes Use visualizations created by New Relic no yes yes yes * There are a few Nerdlets that basic users are allowed to use. See Basic users for more information. New Relic One user model If your organization is part of the New Relic One pricing model, the user types, privileges, and capabilities are different than those of our original user model: Basic user Full user Serve Nerdpacks yes yes Publish Nerdpacks no yes Subscribe to Nerdpacks no yes Tag Nerdpacks no yes Use Nerdlets or visualizations created by your accounts no yes Use Nerdlets created by New Relic no* yes Use visualizations created by New Relic no yes * There are a few Nerdlets that basic users are allowed to use. See Basic users for more information. Nerdpack permissions: Original user model Learn the differences between how basic users, full users, and admins can use and manage Nerdpacks in the original user model. Basic users If you're a basic user in the original user model, you're limited in your Nerdpack capabilities. You can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally. To publish, tag, subscribe to, and use your Nerdpacks, an admin must upgrade you to a full user. Tip If you're a basic user, you generally can't use any Nerdpacks. However, there are some Nerdlets that New Relic maintains that you can use. These are rare and there is currently no way for you to distinguish them in our web interface. And even if you can use a Nerdlet in a Nerdpack, you're never able to use custom visualizations. For this, you must be upgraded to a full user. Full users If you're a full user in the original user model, you either: Have the Nerdpack Manager add-on role Don't have the Nerdpack Manager add-on role The Nerdpack Manager role is required to publish, subscribe to, and tag Nerdpacks. So if you don't have the Nerdpack Manager role, you can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally and use Nerdpacks that your accounts have already been subscribed to. To publish, tag, or subscribe to a Nerdpack, an admin must upgrade you to a full user or grant you the Nerdpack Manager add-on role. Owner/Admin users If you're an owner or admin user, you can perform any of the Nerdpack capabilities. You can create, serve, publish, tag, subscribe to, and use any and all Nerdpack artifacts, both Nerdlets and visualizations. This includes Nerdpacks built by New Relic or by one of your accounts. Nerdpack permissions: New Relic One user model Learn the differences between how basic users and full users can use and manage Nerdpacks in the New Relic One user model. Basic users If you're a basic user in the New Relic One user model, you're limited in your Nerdpack capabilities. You can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally. To publish, tag, subscribe to, and use your Nerdpacks, an admin must upgrade you to a full user. Tip If you're a basic user, you generally can't use any Nerdpacks. However, there are some Nerdlets that New Relic maintains that you can use. These are rare and there is currently no way for you to distinguish them in our web interface. And even if you can use a Nerdlet in a Nerdpack, you're never able to use custom visualizations. For this, you must be upgraded to a full user. Full users If you're a full user in the New Relic One user model, you either: Have the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege Don't have the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege The Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege is required to publish, subscribe to, and tag Nerdpacks. So if you don't have the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege, you can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally and use Nerdpacks that your accounts have already been subscribed to. To publish, tag, or subscribe to your Nerdpack, an admin must grant you the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege. Tip The Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege is included in both the User and Admin groups, the only groups available by default. So in most cases, you'll have the ability to manage Nerdpacks as a full user. However, if you're a full user assigned to a custom group that doesn't include the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege, you won't be able to manage Nerdpacks. Master/Sub-account Capabilities Some accounts, called master accounts, have sub-accounts that report data back up to them. This organizational hierarchy affects Nerdpack capabilities. In general, the flow of control moves downstream: In this example scenario A, the master account publishes a Nerdpack. This means that all three accounts, Master, Account 1, and Account 2, can subscribe to it. If you subscribe the master account to the Nerdpack, then users of all three accounts can use it. If you subscribe Account 1 to it, only Account 1 users can use it, because neither Master nor Account 2 is downstream in the hierarchy. In scenario B, the sub-account, Account 1, publishes a Nerdpack, so you can't use or subscribe to the Nerdpack from Master or Account 2.",

In this guide, you learn how to: Use the nr1 CLI to generate a default visualization Run your visualization locally where you can quickly test and iterate Publish your visualization to the New Relic One catalog Add your visualization to a dashboard Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create a new visualization Use nr1 to generate the boilerplate for a new visualization. Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called my-awesome-visualization, in a Nerdpack, called my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name my-awesome-visualization ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ... my-awesome-nerdpack ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-awesome-nerdpack is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization my-awesome-visualization is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another. Step 4 of 4 In index.js, change your component's Radar.fillOpacity: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 } from 'recharts'; 10 import {Card, CardBody, HeadingText, NrqlQuery, Spinner, AutoSizer} from 'nr1'; 11 12 export default class MyAwesomeVisualizationVisualization extends React.Component { 13 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 14 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "info": "Build a \"Hello, World!\" app and publish it to New Relic One",
      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in the New Relic One Catalog, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "Publish your Nerdpack, whether it's still in development, ready for testing, or stable, to share it with others. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions When you publish your Nerdpack, it's registered with the New Relic One catalog. From there, some users can subscribe to your Nerdpack. Subscribing users need to have: Access to the account that published the Nerdpack The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Update your package version You can only publish a package version to the catalog one time. For example, you can't publish two instances of version 1.0.0. So, each time you want to deploy a new version of your code, you need to increment its version in the Nerdpack's package.json file: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy Tip Nerdpack versions follow semantic versioning. Read the documentation to learn more. Generate a UUID for your Nerdpack If you built your Nerdpack from scratch with nr1 create --type nerdpack, then your Nerdpack has a unique identifier. Find this identifier in the root directory's nr1.json file: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"DemoApp\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack demo-app\" } nr1.json Copy This ID must be unique to your Nerdpack when you publish it to the catalog. The platform will reject your Nerdpack if it recognizes the ID. So, if you cloned an existing Nerdpack or are otherwise using open source code, generate a new UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --generate --force Tip Read the nr1 nerdpack:uuid documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --help Publish your Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish If you've successfully published your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This output describes the published Nerdpack. First, it states the Nerdpack's ID (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890). Then, its version (1.0.0). Finally, its version tag (STABLE). You already managed your Nerdpack's ID and version, but the version tag is new. To manage your Nerdpack's versions, you can tag them with an arbitrary tag. For example, if a version is still in development, you can tag it with a DEV tag. If the version moves to a QA phase, you can tag it with QA. If it's ready for production, you can tag it with STABLE. Tip Read our tag guide to learn more. Use the -t or --tag option to publish your Nerdpack with a tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag DEV As you saw in the nr1 nerdpack:publish output, if you don't pass a tag, nr1 applies the STABLE tag automatically. However, you can tell it to not apply any tags to a release with the -T or --skip-tag option: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --skip-tag You can also perform a dry run to make sure you publish your Nerdpack the way you want to: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --dry-run Step 2 of 4 Once you've successfully published your Nerdpack, go to New Relic: Because you're going to view a published Nerdpack, rather than a locally served one, you don't need to pass the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to Apps: Whether you published a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Apps. Step 4 of 4 Find your published Nerdpack under New Relic One catalog: Notice the Custom indicator on its UI tile. Use this to distinguish between published Nerdpacks and locally-served Nerdpacks. Tip Only Nerdpacks with tagged versions are shown under New Relic One catalog. So, if you published without a tag or removed a tag from your published Nerdpack, you won't see it in the catalog. Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you publish your Nerdpack, you may come across issues. Whether you can't publish your Nerdpack due to some issue with your code or you can't find your Nerdpack in the catalog, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your command When you attempt to publish your Nerdpack, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. For example: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack DemoApp (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890) › Error: There is already a Nerdpack with given id & version. › Code: 409 It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --verbose Reveal your published Nerdpack information If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, it may not be tagged. Remember, at least one version of your published Nerdpack must have a tag for it to show on the Apps page. See more information about your published Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:info: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 3014918 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 3 hours ago In this example, there is one published version, but it isn't tagged. You can tag a published version with: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --from-version=1.0.0 --tag=DEV Now, if you refresh your browser page, you should see your Nerdpack on Apps. Tip Read our nr1 nerdpack:tag documentation to learn more. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you publish your Nerdpack, only users who can access your account can see your published Nerdpack. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic but you know it's published, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same.",

In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the New Relic One catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in the catalog Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the New Relic One app catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Apps: From here, you can see your application under New Relic One catalog: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots... ✔ Screenshots uploaded ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release! Includes: - A variety of charts for understanding the test r... whatsNew.version: 1.0.0 All the information from catalog shows here. Step 3 of 3 View your app in the catalog: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public New Relic One catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Subscribe to your New Relic One application.",

Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic explorer is a good place to get overview information about your applications, as well as detailed information, such as distributed tracing. To get started with the explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Explorer. In the left sidebar, click Services - OpenTelemetry: Click the service you want to know more about. If you need help understanding the data, see the explanations which follow. Summary page The opening page of the explorer is the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. Distributed tracing When you access distributed tracing through the explorer, you are looking at traces that include that service. Once you’re in that service, you can filter spans to find the ones you want. For example, to query service.name or trace.id, you can use the following: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID For more ways to filter and analyze your spans, see our distributed tracing UI page. Tip If you prefer to search traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization, you can go outside explorer: one.newrelic.com > Apps > Favorites > Distributed tracing. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time. To get a list of transactions: From the Transaction Summary page, select the transactions table. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. Externals Externals capture calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. Errors On the Errors page, you can see total errors as well as charts showing error count and error rate. Logs The Logs page displays logs from your application.

Our OpenTelemetry log data model in GitHub describes them in detail. Let's look at how to send logs, correlate them with applications, and view them in New Relic. Send logs to New Relic The New Relic Exporter for the OpenTelemetry Collector supports exporting logs to New Relic. The general pattern is to configure the collector to: Receive logs from any of the log receivers. Some of the receiver options include Filelog Receiver, Fluent Forward Receiver, and Syslog Receiver. Process logs, potentially annotating them with resource information. Some of the processor options include Resource Detection Processor and Resource Processor. Export logs via the New Relic Exporter. Application log correlation Application logs are more useful if they're correlated with other telemetry data produced by the application. The OpenTelemetry semantic convention for services specifies service.name as a required field. All application metric, trace, and log data sent to New Relic with the same service.name are associated with the same entity. The specifics of how logs get annotated with the service.name resource attribute depends on the application's environment: Applications may produce structured JSON logs, which you can configure to include service.name as another field. You can deploy applications alongside a dedicated Collector Agent instance, which you can configure with a Resource Processor to annotate logs with the service.name attribute. Optionally, additional application trace context (sometimes called execution context) can be propagated to log messages. The setup and availability of this depends on the language and logging framework used by the application. The general strategy is to set up the application to write structured JSON logs and to configure it to extract trace context into specified trace context fields on available log messages. The Logs in Context with Log4j2 example in GitHub demonstrates an end-to-end working example for a simple Java application using Log4j2. View OpenTelemetry logs Here are two ways you can view logs: Look in the New Relic Logs UI. If your logs are correlated with an application, view them in the context of the application.",

If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",
