      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: allows you to configure your Nerdlet and write to your Nerdlet's URL state.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Fetch data from a third-party service, before starting this one. In this course, you're building a New Relic One application. This application shows telemetry data from a demo service that is running an A/B test so that it can reveal that data in charts, like a dashboard. Your New Relic application is different than a dashboard, however, because it does more than show New Relic data. It pulls external data, provides UI components and functionality, and even has its own small data stores. The purpose of this New Relic application is to present context so you can better understand the A/B test results and how those results tie in to your business objectives. So far, you've built all your charts, organized them for improved usability, provided them with real data, and more. There are some final improvements you can make, using Platform API components. In this lesson, you learn how to use values in the New Relic platform state. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-platform-state-context/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, add a PlatformStateContext.Consumer to your NewsletterSignups component's render() method: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Notice that NrqlQuery uses a constant called ACCOUNT_ID. Instead of hardcoding an account identifier in your Nerdlet, you can use accountId from the platform URL state. Step 3 of 10 PlatformStateContext.Consumer provides access to the platform's URL state. This context contains an important value you'll use in your app, called timeRange. Notice that your NrqlQuery uses a SINCE clause that identifies the historical timeframe your query should fetch data from. Right now, that SINCE clause is set to 30 MINUTES AGO. With timeRange, you can use the platform's time picker to make this timeframe adjustable. Step 4 of 10 Utilize the platform state's timeRange: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, NewsletterSignups uses platformState.timeRange instead of a hardcoded SINCE clause. While NrqlQuery components accept a convenient timeRange prop, not every component does. You can still use timeRange in other contexts by accessing duration, begin_time, or end_time: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { console.log(platformState.timeRange.duration); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>; Copy Step 5 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test. Step 6 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 7 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 10 View your application: Your NrqlQuery now uses the platform state's timeRange, but your chart probably still shows the last 30 minutes. Why? Where does the timeRange in platform state come from? The time picker sits on the right side of your application's navigation bar: Change this value and see your chart update: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 9 of 10 Update VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Of all the charts in your New Relic One application, these three charts are the ones that should update with the time picker. The others, Total subscriptions per version, Total cancellations per version, Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions, Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, show total values over time. So, hardcoding their SINCE clauses to 7 DAYS AGO makes sense, as this is a reasonable time period for the purposes of this course. Step 10 of 10 While still serving your Nerdpack locally, view your NR1 app to see your charts updating with the time range you choose: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now that you're basing your queries off the platform state, some of your charts are dynamic in their time ranges. This is a great improvement because it allows you to adjust your charts to show data from any particular point in time, which is useful for tying data to business outcomes. The Platform API components offer a lot more functionality, too, including the ability to navigate the user to another place in New Relic. You'll learn how to do this in the next lesson. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Add navigation to your nerdlet.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you used PlatformStateContext from the New Relic One SDK to look up the time range that the user selected from the app's time picker. Now, you'll learn about another component that interacts with the New Relic platform: navigation. The navigation component lets you open entities, navigate to entities, and build Location objects for entities from your Nerdlet. You can also use navigation for other Nerdlets and launchers. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-navigation/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In newsletter-signups.js, create a new method, called NewsletterSignups.openApmEntity(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. This method uses navigation.openStackedEntity() to display your demo application's APM entity in a stacked view. Notice openApmEntity() requires your ENTITY_GUID. You need to locate that ID and store it in a constant. Step 3 of 10 Navigate to APM: See metadata for your Newsletter service: Copy the entity's GUID: Create an ENTITY_GUID constant: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and the entity GUID you just copied, respectively. Now, openApmEntity() knows what entity to show. Next, you need to create a button to invoke this method. Step 4 of 10 Create a button to show your APM entity: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you've created a button and configured it to call openApmEntity() when it's clicked. Step 5 of 10 Import Stack and StackItem: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. You'll use Stack and StackItem to lay out the button on the far right side of the same row that the HeadingText is on. Step 6 of 10 Lay out the Stack: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <Stack fullWidth> <StackItem grow={true}> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> </StackItem> <StackItem> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> </StackItem> </Stack> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you used a full-width Stack to set up the layout for the row. To make the HeadingText fill the entire row except the width of the button, you used the StackItem.grow prop. Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. Click App performance: Now you see the stacked entity: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively Congratulations! You're finished writing all the code you'll write for your New Relic One A/B test application. Now, you have an application reporting New Relic data from your demo service that is running an A/B test. You've created several charts, buttons, and other UI elements. And you've organized your components into a readable and usable view. On top of the visuals, you've supplied data to your charts from multiple data sources in and outside of New Relic. You've created some backend functionality which utilizes your New Relic One application's own data store. You've also utilized the platform APIs for interacting with platform UI and showing a stacked entity view. You've really accomplished a lot throughout this course, so far. There are only a few things left to do! First, is to learn how to publish and subscribe to your New Relic One application so that it can run on our platform instead of your own local server. Second, is to learn how to deal with some common issues you might see in New Relic One application development. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Describe your app for the catalog.",

Check your permissions To tag a Nerdpack version, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can tag them. Tag a version After you've published a Nerdpack version to the New Relic One catalog, you can tag it with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 2 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. Here, you tagged version 1.0.0 as DEV. Now, you, and other users on your account, can use this tag: You see the tag as an option to subscribe to when you add the Nerdpack to your account If you subscribe to the DEV tag and it gets updated later—say, DEV is applied to version 1.0.1—you automatically get upgraded to the new version without having to subscribe again. Important One of the features of tagging release versions is that users who are subscribed to a tag automatically get updates when that tag is used for another version. This means that if a user is testing one version, say 1.0.0, and you apply that same tag to another version, say 1.0.1, that user will see version 1.0.1 in their account, and they can no longer access the Nerdpack they were testing before. Often times, this is the expected behavior, but make sure you consider this side effect when you use tags. Step 2 of 2 View your Nerdpack's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 5 hours ago DEV This output confirms your DEV tag on version 1.0.0. Untag a version As you build more versions of your Nerdpack, you may update your tags to newer versions. However, you can also remove a tag from your Nerdpack with nr1. Step 1 of 3 From your Nerdpack's root directory, view your registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ---- 2.0.0 a few seconds ago DEV 1.0.1 8 minutes ago BETA, STABLE 1.0.0 6 hours ago Here, you see that version 1.0.0 has no tags, version 1.0.1 has two tags, BETA and STABLE, and version 2.0.0 has one tag, DEV. Step 2 of 3 Remove the BETA tag from your Nerdpack versions: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:untag --tag=BETA ✔ Removed nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 tag BETA. Step 3 of 3 Verify that the tag was removed from your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- -------------- ---- 2.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV 1.0.1 13 minutes ago STABLE 1.0.0 6 hours ago Resolve issues with tagging a Nerdpack version Sometimes, when you tag to a Nerdpack version, you may come across issues. Whether you can't tag your Nerdpack or you can't untag your Nerdpack, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Publish your Nerdpack If you try to tag your Nerdpack without first publishing it, you'll get an error: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV › Error: A downstream error occurred. This error message doesn't say much, but you can use the --verbose option to see more information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV --verbose init version: @oclif/command@1.8.0 argv: [ '--tag=DEV', '--verbose', [length]: 2 ] dist/metadata.json does not exist. package.json will be used instead. Using profile account-1234567 Request: POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Data: mutation nerdpackTagVersion( nerdpackId: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", versionTag: tag: \"DEV\", version: \"1.0.0\" } ) nerdpackId tags version } } Headers: 'API-Key': '<YOU USER KEY>', 'Content-Type': 'application/graphql' } This more verbose error message shows the GraphQL that runs behind the scenes for nr1 nerdpack:tag. The important part of the message here is: bash Copy dist/metadata.json does not exist. package.json will be used instead. The dist directory is created when you publish your app. So, because it hasn't been published yet, this directory doesn't exist and nr1 falls back to package.json to look for details about your Nerdpack. But, because the UUID in your package.json isn't in the New Relic registry, the command failed. So, before you tag your versions, publish them to the registry: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV Tip Remember that you can also tag a version at the same time you deploy it! bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag=DEV Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack You can only remove tags that have no subscribers. If you try to remove a tag that users are subscribed to, you'll get an error: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 2.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 3 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 2.0.0 an hour ago DEV 1.0.1 an hour ago 1.0.0 6 hours ago $ nr1 nerdpack:untag -t DEV › Error: A downstream error occurred. In this case, check to see if you're subscribed to the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ----------------- ----------- ---------- 2.0.0 ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 MyAwesomeNerdpack an hour ago 1000383529 This shows that you're subscribed to MyAwesomeNerdpack. Unsubscribe, then try to remove the DEV tag again: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. $ nr1 nerdpack:untag --tag=DEV ✔ Removed nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 tag DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 2.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 3 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 2.0.0 an hour ago 1.0.1 an hour ago 1.0.0 6 hours ago",

      "body": "One way for users to access your Nerdlet is by creating a launcher. The launcher opens a Nerdlet from the Apps page in New Relic. You can also provide access to your Nerdlet from an entity in your account. In this guide, you'll learn how to attach your Nerdlet to your entities. Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install and configure the New Relic One CLI Create a Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 Create a Nerdpack with the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name entity-nerdlet This results in a Nerdpack, called entity-nerdlet, which consists of a launcher, called entity-nerdlet-launcher, and a Nerdlet, called entity-nerdlet-nerdlet. Step 2 of 4 Serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ cd entity-nerdlet $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 4 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and navigate to Apps: ?nerdpacks=local is required to enable your locally served Nerdpacks to load in New Relic. Step 4 of 4 Under Your apps, click your launcher to view your New Relic One application: Attach your Nerdlet to entities You've seen how you can access your Nerdlet from a launcher. Now, access your Nerdlet from your entities. Step 1 of 6 From inside your Nerdpack's root directory, open nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json. This is your Nerdlet's metadata file. You'll use this file to attach your Nerdlet to entities. Step 2 of 6 Add a context object with an entities array: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [] 8 } 9 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy This tells New Relic that you want to surface your Nerdlet in an array of entity contexts. Step 3 of 6 Add an entity context: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [ 8 { 9 \"domain\": \"APM\", 10 \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" 11 } 12 ] 13 } 14 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Here, you've attached your Nerdlet to all application entities in the APM domain. Step 4 of 6 Go to APM: Because you're serving your Nerdpack locally, remember that you must still specify the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 5 of 6 Choose any of your applications: Step 6 of 6 Scroll down to see your Nerdlet attached to the application: Click this menu option and see your Nerdlet the same way you did with the launcher. Configure your entities context The context.entities key in your Nerdlet's nr1.json file specifies which entities your Nerdlet should be attached to. Specify an entity domain Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity domain by specifying the domain as one of the following values: APM: Application Performance Monitoring BROWSER: Browser INFRA: Infrastructure monitoring MOBILE: Mobile monitoring SYNTH: Synthetic monitoring For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities in the APM domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those in a domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"!APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities in multiple domains: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" }] } } Copy Specify an entity type Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity type by specifying the type as one of the following values: APPLICATION HOST MONITOR For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities of the APPLICATION type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those of a specified type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"!APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity whose type matches one of an array of types: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }, { \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }] } } Copy Specify entity tags Attach your Nerdlet to entities that have a given tag. For example, attach your Nerdlet to the entity which has a particular GUID: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"guid\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ENTITY GUID>\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity which has particular accountId and uses the Python programming language: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"accountId\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ACCOUNT ID>\"] }, { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Combine filters When you filter the entities to which your Nerdlet will be added, you can combine domain, type, and tags: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"domain\": \"APM\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\", \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] }, { \"domain\": \"SYNTH\", \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" } ] } } Copy In this example, you've attached your Nerdlet to: All APM applications whose metadata tags specify the python language AND all Synthetic monitors AND all Browser entities",

      "body": "The second version of our StatsD integration was released on May 25 2020. It's an improvement on our first StatsD integration. Improvements include: simpler configuration, and a simpler method for adding tags (key-value pairs). Features Our StatsD integration (version 2) lets you easily get StatsD-format data into New Relic. You can also add any arbitrary tags (key-value pairs) to your data. Once your metrics are in New Relic, you can query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Requirements This integration uses our Metric API and our Event API to ingest data. To use these APIs, you'll need an Insert API key. The integration adheres to the Metric API requirements and data limits. The default rate limit is 100,000 data points per minute (DPM). If you think you're missing metrics or sending more than 100K DPM, see Request data changes. To see if your account is hitting the rate limit, run the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' FACET category, message LIMIT 100 since 1 day ago Copy Install This section will explain how to do a standard install. If you want to run StatsD in Kubernetes, see Kubernetes install. To install the StatsD integration, run the following command and include your New Relic account ID and New Relic Insert API key. This generates a TOML configuration file used by gostatsd. docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy If your account is in the EU data center region, add this to the above command: -e NR_EU_REGION=true \\ Copy After installing, you can: Do optional additional configuration Define your metrics Add custom tags to your data Create alerts Install for Kubernetes Here are examples of Kubernetes manifests for deployment and service objects: Kubernetes manifest examples Below are examples of Kubernetes manifests to deploy StatsD in a Kubernetes environment and create a StatsD service named newrelic-statsd. You need to insert your account ID and your license key. deployment.yml: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: selector: matchLabels: app: newrelic-statsd replicas: 2 revisionHistoryLimit: 2 template: metadata: labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: containers: - name: newrelic-statsd image: newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 env: - name: NR_ACCOUNT_ID value: \"NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID\" - name: NR_API_KEY value: \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy service.yml: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: newrelic-statsd port: 80 targetPort: 8125 protocol: UDP selector: app: newrelic-statsd Copy For configuration details, see Kubernetes configuration. Configure In the install procedure, you run nri-statsd with environment variables, and this generates a TOML configuration file. Additionally, you can set these configuration options: Configuration options Description expiry-interval string If a metric is not updated for this amount of time, we stop reporting that metric. Default is 5m. If you want to send the metrics only if the value was updated between the flush intervals, configure this to 1ms. To never expire metrics, set it to 0. percent-threshold list of integers Specifies the percentiles used for metrics aggregation. Default: 90. metrics-addr string Indicates address on which to listen for metrics. Default: :8125. Tip To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the StatsD integration you must define the following endpoints in the custom configuration: address = 'https://gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/ $NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' Copy address-metrics = 'https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' Copy Here are some examples of customizing configuration by overwriting the default configuration: Example of custom configuration # Specify after how long do we expire metrics, default:5m expiry-interval = '1ms' # percent-threshold specify a list of percentiles for metrics aggregation, default:90 percent-threshold = [90, 99] backends='newrelic' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy Disable timer sub-metrics: By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. If you want to disable those metrics you can do it by adding a disabled-sub-metrics configuration section and set true for the ones you want disabled. Here's an example: # disabled-sub-metrics configuration section allows disabling timer sub-metrics [disabled-sub-metrics] # Regular metrics count=false count-per-second=false mean=false median=false lower=false upper=false stddev=false sum=false sum-squares=false # Percentile metrics count-pct=false mean-pct=false sum-pct=false sum-squares-pct=false lower-pct=false upper-pct=false Copy Docker: overwrite default configuration To overwrite the default nri-statsd configuration while running in a container, you can mount a configuration file inside the container. You can adopt the following template as needed for your situation. Example: backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To run the container with the file mounted in the appropriate path: docker run \\ ... -v ${PWD}/nri-statsd.toml:/etc/opt/newrelic/nri-statsd.toml \\ ... newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Kubernetes: overwrite default configuration The best approach to configure nri-statsd running in Kubernetes is to use a configMap and mount the configMap into the container. (This is a similar process to mounting the configuration file in Docker.) Example: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-statsd-config namespace: default data: nri-statsd.toml: | backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = '$NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To use the configMap, declare a volume on your deployment spec template and then declare a volumeMount on your container spec. Example: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment spec: template: spec: containers: .... volumeMounts: - mountPath: /etc/opt/newrelic/ name: nri-statsd-config volumes: - name: nri-statsd-config configMap: name: nri-statsd-config Copy Metric format The integration receives metrics using the StatsD protocol. Optionally, the sample rate can be configured and tags can be added. Here's the metric data format we use: <metric name>:<value>|<type>|@<sample rate>|#<tags> Copy Here are explanations of these fields: Field name Description < metric name> string Required. Name of the metric. < value> string Required. The metric type: c = counter g = gauge ms = timer @ < sample rate> float Optional for simple counters or timer counters. When many metrics must be sent, you can use sampling to reduce network traffic. The downside is a reduction in the resolution of the data. An example of how this would work for sample rates below 1: If you set this to 0.1, the counter would send a measurement one out of every 10 times. # < tags> string Optional. Tags attached to your metrics are converted into attributes (key-value pairs). For more on tagging options, see Tags. Metric types Here are the types of metrics and how to format them: Counter A counter measures the number of occurrences of an event. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. A counter can be incremented or decremented during the same flush interval by adding a sign to the value. In the following example, the counter value will be 2: counter:4|c counter:-2|c Copy At each flush, the current count is sent and reset to 0. If the count is not updated, at the next flush it will send the value 0. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Here’s an example of a counter that is being sampled 1 out of 10 times: counter:4|c@0.1 Copy Gauge A gauge represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include temperature, CPU usage, and memory. Here's an example: temperature:40|g Copy If the gauge is not updated, at the next flush it will send the previous value. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Timer The timer metric type measures timing data. By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. These are sent as sub-metrics in the following format: <metric_base_name>.std_dev <metric_base_name>.median <metric_base_name>.summary <metric_base_name>.sum_squares <metric_base_name>.mean <metric_base_name>.per_second Copy The configured percentiles will generate the following metrics. The percentile threshold value will be attached as a tag. <metric_base_name>.sum_squares.percentiles <metric_base_name>.sum.percentiles <metric_base_name>.count.percentiles <metric_base_name>.upper.percentiles <metric_base_name>.mean.percentiles Copy The percentile threshold can be tweaked with the percent-threshold config option. These can be controlled through the disabled-sub-metrics configuration section. Add tags (attributes) You can add tags to your data, which we save as attributes (key-value pairs). There are two options for adding tags: Add default tags that apply to all metrics: These apply to all metrics. They are fixed and don't change over time. Add metric-level tags: These apply to specific metrics and allow the value to be changed between two submits. Add default tags that apply to all metrics Add tags to metrics and events by defining an environment variable in the startup command. Here's an example that would create two tags: -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" Copy Here's that environment variable used in the startup command: docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Add metric-level tags When defining the metric format, you can add tags using this format: <bucket name>:<value>|<type>|#<tags> Copy In this example, <tags> is a comma-separated list of tags. Tags format is: simple or key:value. Here's an example NRQL query that includes a custom tag: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE environment = 'production' Copy Create alerts You can alert on StatsD data using NRQL alert conditions. Alert example This procedure walks you through sending some sample data and then creating an alert condition using that data. First, send this data to New Relic’s StatsD container: echo \"prod.test.num:32|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Next, create a NRQL alert condition using this query: SELECT latest(prod.test.num) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'prod.test.num' Copy Here's an image showing creating this NRQL alert condition. Notice that the sample data sent in is represented by the blue dot on the upper right of the chart. Now we can create the alert condition with these settings: Remember to set the Condition name. If a metric with a value above 50 is sent, then an incident is created and notified. The incident is closed automatically after 24 hours. To test that the alert is working, run this command: echo \"prod.test.num:60|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Find and use data To query your data, you'd use any New Relic query option. For example, you might run a NRQL query like: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'myMetric' and environment = 'production' Copy For more on how to query the Metric data type, see Query metric data. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your New Relic APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the Browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Subscription level This feature requires a Browser Pro subscription. The instrumentation level setting for an application does not affect the availability of JavaScript API functions. Agent version Your New Relic Browser agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 60 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 60-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the Browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default Browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute Browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the Browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute Browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual Browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default Mobile events using the New Relic Mobile SDK. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple Mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the Mobile crash event trail. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default Mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams. Be sure to follow your organization's obligations for notices and consent regulations. Deprecated methods As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create custom events. The recordEvent methods for Android and iOS are deprecated. The deprecated recordEvent events do not have their own event type; they are recorded as a Mobile event type with a category attribute value of custom. recordCustomEvent creates an event with an eventType you can assign. But the eventType should only be used for one or two high-level event types, not for naming events. For example, you might have one event type Gestures, with many different names under that one type. For more context on this, see the recordCustomEvent query example.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic reports event data that is displayed in some UI displays and is also available for querying and charting. Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description Mobile A Mobile event is created when a crash occurs, when an interaction ends or has run for 1 second, or if a session completes after the app is closed, backgrounded, or has run for 10 minutes. Mobile events were once the only event type and were generated for every event, but now there are several specialized event types. Recommendation: Upgrade to the most recent New Relic Mobile agent version to take full advantage of the new event types. MobileBreadcrumb There are no attributes listed for this event because it's a custom event; attributes will include the session attributes and any custom attributes added. MobileCrash The MobileCrash event is created when an app crashes. MobileCrash includes attributes such as crash line number, class, and crash message. MobileHandledException MobileHandledException is sent when an exception is caught and is used for non-fatal exceptions reported to New Relic using the recordHandledException API call for Android or iOS. The exceptions will be visible in queries of this event and on the Handled exceptions UI page, including stack traces. MobileRequest A MobileRequest event is created when an HTTP request successfully completes, resulting in a response code below 400. To use this event type, you must have Mobile agent version 5.14.0 or higher for Android or iOS. New Relic MobileRequest data is enabled by default for: Android version 5.15.2 or higher iOS version 6.0.0 or higher For earlier versions, starting with Android version 5.14.0 or iOS version 5.14.0, you must enable the feature. Upgrade to the latest Android or iOS version, or enable the NetworkRequests feature flag by using the Android or iOS configuration settings. MobileRequestError A MobileRequestError is used for HTTP errors or network failures. HTTP errors are HTTP requests that have a status code greater than 400. A network failure is an HTTP request that results in no response. The event is sent when the HTTP request completes. For best results, use New Relic Mobile agent 5.14.0 or higher for Android or iOS. With lower agent versions, some attributes may be missing, and you will not have access to MobileRequest events. MobileSession A MobileSession event is sent when an app is closed, backgrounded, or when 10 minutes of active use has elapsed. This is the source of the general session data used by the other New Relic Mobile events. MobileSession captures attributes such as device type, device OS, and geographical information. Custom events There is no attribute list for this event type because it is a custom event; attributes will include the session attributes and any custom attributes that you add.

Requirements For event and attribute formatting requirements and best practices, see Limits and requirements. Avoid rate limits Reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance. It may also result in approaching or passing data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Example use cases Two popular custom data solutions are custom events and custom attributes. There are several ways to accomplish this (more on that later in this doc), depending on your New Relic implementation and tools. Here are some common use cases for implementing custom events and attributes. Using custom attributes Custom attributes are often used to add important business and operational context to existing events. Business context might include: Customer token Customer market segment Customer value classification Workflow control values not obvious in the URIStem User/product/account privilege context Operational context might include: Which feature flags were used What datastore was accessed What cache was accessed What errors were detected and ignored (fault partitioning) Using custom events Event data is one of New Relic's four core data types. We recommend reading that definition to understand what we mean by \"event\" and why that data type is most used for reporting specific types of activity. The use cases for custom events varies widely: basically they are used for any type of activity that an organization deems important and that is not already being monitored. A couple examples: An event might represent an activity involving multiple actions, like a customer purchasing a certain combination of products. An event might record backup activity. For example, they might set up reporting of events that represent production backups of their SOLR instances into an event table, with a timestamp of when it occurred, which cluster, and the duration. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser monitoring agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the Browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via Browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure monitoring agent Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile monitoring agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetic monitoring Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. Terragrunt is a thin wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state. In this guide, you will use Terragrunt to generate your Terraform configurations, create files with Terragrunt, and reuse the Terragrunt configuration to manage multiple environments. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic Infrastructure agent for your host. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: You will also need to install Terragrunt to follow this guide: bash Copy $ brew install terragrunt To follow the examples in this guide, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 6 Create a new configuration Terragrunt is a wrapper that provides extra tooling for your Terraform configurations. In the next steps, you will create a new configuration using Terragrunt, Terraform, and New Relic. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terragrunt-config && cd terragrunt-config In the new directory, create a terragrunt.hcl file, create a ./src directory, and create a ./environments directory: bash Copy $ touch terragrunt.hcl $ mkdir src $ mkdir environments Inside of your environments folder, create a folder named dev. In the ./src directory, create a main.tf and provider.tf files: bash Copy $ mkdir environments/dev $ touch src/main.tf $ touch src/provider.tf In the provider.tf file add the appropriate Terraform and New Relic provider configuration information: terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } Copy In the main.tf add a New Relic alert policy named DemoPolicy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Copy In the ./environments/dev directory create a new file named terragrunt.hcl bash Copy $ cd ./environments/dev/ $ touch terragrunt.hcl Within the dev folder update the terragrunt.hcl file by adding the following include statement. The include statement tells Terragrunt to use any .hcl confgiuration files it finds in parent folders. include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } Copy Next, add a Terraform block to provide Terragrunt with a Terraform source reference. terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Now you need to configure the provider with your New Relic account details. You will need your New Relic user API key and account ID. provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you have a single account: The account ID is displayed on the API keys page. If your organization has multiple accounts: From one.newrelic.com, select Entity explorer and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page. Tip Documentation about the New Relic provider is provided on the Terraform doc site. Update the provider.tf file to define the New Relic account variables that will help keep the Terraform configuration dynamic. variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy In your terminal, change directories to the environments/dev folder and run the command terragrunt init: bash Copy $ terragrunt init Terraform init sets up a bit of context, sets up environment variables, and then runs terraform init. You will see the following output: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. [terragrunt] [/Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev] 2021/02/02 13:30:31 Copying lock file [output] from /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev/.terragrunt-cache/e-PoBgWhdv3v8QGOtDQxS_WeYu4/ 69zjIFUfApJiUt8gFmi-6-dcPe8/.terraform.lock.hcl to /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy $ terragrunt plan Terragrunt starts to run but pauses to ask for the inputs to the New Relic account variables added to the provider.tf file. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2/02 13:32:08 Running command: terraform plan var.newrelic_account_id Enter a value: Interrupt received. Exit the terragrunt plan process with CTRL+C . In the environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl file, add an inputs block to provide the values for your New Relic account variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy The updated terragrunt.hcl only has the include, terraform, and inputs block include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Now, when you run terragrunt plan, Terragrunt will provide the input block's values, no longer prompting the command line for values. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Run terragrunt apply. After Terraform finishes process, check your New Relic account for the new Demo Policy. Step 2 of 6 Adding to your configuration Now that you have a basic New Relic configuration created, add configurations built in the Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides in this step. Tip If you haven't done the previous developer guides, you can copy the configurations for this section from the Terragrunt Intro Github Repo. Update the main.tf to include the additional terraform configurations. Update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy You have added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. To clone the module from GitHub, run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply. After Terraform is done processing, You will see your Demo Policy now has two conditions in your New Relic account and one alert channel attached. Step 3 of 6 Using your Environment as a Terragrunt Variable Using Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you are running to the name of the data you are creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create a new input for env_name inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy in the main.tf file add a new variable for 'env_name' variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Using string interpolation, add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks. resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to the configuration name. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Currently, the environment variable name is hardcoded into the root terragrunt.hcl file. You want to avoid having your variables hardcoded, using a terragrunt built-in function will pass the value. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use the path_relative_to_include() built-in function and pass the value has the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output, the env_name variable will have the entire ./environments/dev/ path. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Next, update the terragrunt.hcl to only include 'dev' as the env_name variable. Adding a locals block creates a local variable, using the replace built-in function will remove the unwanted parts of the relative path, and update the inputs block to use the local variable. locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output the env_name variable will now have 'dev:' added. Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Step 4 of 6 Storing the State Remotely At the moment, the state file is local. The next steps will update your Terraform configurations to remove the local state file and use a file stored remotely in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, various state files will need to be store in separate S3 buckets, not to override each other. Terragrunt allows you to generate files on the fly. Adding the remote_state block into the root level terragrunt.hcl file, you will generate a new file named backend.tf. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"my-terraform-state\" key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true } } Copy After adding the remote_state block, you will need to give the configuration for the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state. Tip To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Now, update the remote_state block to provide your S3 bucket and update the key to use the local environment variable created previously. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Next, run terragrunt plan. If you look in the Amazon S3 bucket, you will see a folder named envs. Within the envs folder is a directory called devs containing terraform.tfstate file. Tip To see the files created by Terragrunt, look inside of the ./environments/dev directory. There is a hidden directory named terragrunt-cache. Within the terragrunt-cache directory, you will see the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Step 5 of 6 Creating a New Environment Now that you have a working configuration for your dev environment, you will create a new environment reusing the dev configurations in the next steps. In the environments directory, create a new folder names nonprod. In the nonprod folder, create a new terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl In the nonprod terragrunt.hcl file copy over the configuration from the environment terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you are using a different account for your nonprod environment, you can update the inputs with a new New Relic account ID and API key. Inside of your nonprod directory, run terragrunt init then run terragrunt apply. In the output, you will see Terraform has created a new set of resources. The new resources should have the nonprod name prefixed. Step 6 of 6 Terragrunt has created two environments, but there is no difference between them other than the name. Adding variables in the configurations allows your configurations to be more dynamic. In the next steps, you will add variables to your configurations. In the main.tf add new variables for the Host Conditions modules cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage values: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy In the main.tf update the HostConditions module values to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Run terragrunt plan. In the output, the HostConditions values have changed to use the variable defaults. Next, you want to pass the values into your environment configurations by adding the inputs block variables. In the nonprod/terragrunt.hcl file, add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy Run terragrunt apply. In your New Relic account, you will see a new policy with configurations changed based on the environment. Conclusion Congratulations! You've used Terragrunt to generate your New Relic configurations and manage multiple environments.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "You can use alerts to set up notification channels, and attach those channels to policies. Your selected channels provide fast and consistent ways for the right personnel to be notified about incidents. For example, notifications allow you to include charts about the incident to provide context and share them with your team. Alerts offers several notification channels, including webhooks, Slack rooms, email, and more. You'll be notified by your notification channels when incidents are opened, acknowledged, or closed. This document explains the available notification channels and how to set them up. Tip This document is about alerts notifications. For general information about unsubscribing from other New Relic emails, including marketing emails, weekly reports, and announcements, see Unsubscribe from New Relic emails. View notification channels To see all notification channels in your account: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. Add or remove notification channels To set up a new notification channel: On the Notification channels, click New notification channel. Select the type of channel and complete other required steps for it. To add or remove a notification policy or channel: Select a specific notification channel, select Alert policies, and add or remove a policy. OR Select a specific policy, select Notification channels, and add or remove a channel. Instructions for specific notification channels These are the available notification channel types. User Requirement: This feature is not available for users on the New Relic One user model, only to users on the original user model (learn about user model differences). As a workaround, you can use the email notification channel. Use the User notification channel to select existing account team members and admins. To view the Users list or to add users to alert policies: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. If a user has configured the New Relic mobile app, the user notification channel also sends push notifications to any of the user's registered mobile devices. If your account has one or more sub-accounts, the notification channel includes only users for the currently selected master or sub-account. Email We automatically add every individual and their email address on the selected account to the User notification channel and you can select them there. You don't need to add existing New Relic accounts to the Email channel. To add an email channel for other users, follow these guidelines: Field Description Email (required) In general, use the Email notification channel to identify user emails or email aliases that are not already on the selected account. For example, if you have a dev-ops@company.com email alias for your DevOps team, add the email alias to the Email channel. Otherwise, use the User notification channel to select specific users on your DevOps team. For easier maintenance, add a single non-user email address or alias to a single alert notification channel. If you want to use the email channel for more than one email, create an email group or alias outside your account. These email addresses can be the same as or different from email addresses already on your account. Users can unsubscribe from general (non-alerts-related) emails, but they cannot unsubscribe from alerts email notifications. Instead, the account Owner, Admin, or add-on manager must remove users from the policy's email notification channel. Include JSON attachment (optional) To include a JSON attachment with the email notification, select this checkbox. OpsGenie You must have an existing OpsGenie account integrated with New Relic in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the OpsGenie notification channel (maximum 64 characters). API key (required) The API key generated from your OpsGenie integration used to authenticate API requests. Teams (optional) List of team names that are responsible for the alert. OpsGenie runs team escalation policies to calculate which users will receive notifications. Tags (optional) A comma-separated list of labels attached to the alert. Tip To overwrite the OpsGenie Quiet Hours setting for urgent alerts, add an OverwriteQuietHours tag. Recipients (optional) One or more names of users, groups, on-call schedules, escalation policies, etc., that OpsGenie uses to calculate where to send notifications. PagerDuty You must have an existing PagerDuty account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Service name (required) The name of your service integrating with PagerDuty for notifications. Integration key (required) The unique service identifier used by PagerDuty's Integration API to trigger, acknowledge, and resolve incidents for the service. Slack Before adding Slack notifications, you must create a unique webhook integration using Slack's New Relic integration. If you want web, transaction, server, and mobile alerts to be posted in separate channels, you must set up separate integrations for each one. Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the Slack notification channel (maximum 64 characters); for example, Network Ops Center. URL (required) Copy and paste the New Relic webhook integration URL that you've set up with Slack. For example: https://hooks.slack.com/services/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 Be sure to include https:// in the URL. Do not use http://. Team channel (optional) If used, include # before the name of the Slack channel where alert notifications are sent; for example, #NOC. VictorOps You must have an existing VictorOps account in order to provide the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for this notification channel (maximum 64 characters). For example, if the VictorOps Route key is for your Technical Support team, you could name this channel Tech Support - VictorOps. Key (required) VictorOps generates a unique key for each account. It maps the VictorOps account to its associated integrations. Route key (optional) This key maps the alert or incident to a specific team. Webhook Webhooks are HTTP POST messages containing JSON documents delivered to a destination URL. When an incident is opened, acknowledged, or closed, our webhook feature sends a message to your URL with any relevant information, such as a description of the event and a link back to New Relic. You also have the option to customize the payload in the POST message for further integration into your system. Important If your endpoint does not acknowledge the POST request within 10 seconds, the Alerts UI may indicate a failed notification event for the related incident. Before adding webhook notifications, you must have an endpoint set up to respond with a status code between 200 and 206 after receiving the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the webhook (maximum 64 characters). Base url (required) The endpoint that will receive the POST message and trigger customized behaviors in your system. Caution If you want to include a port number in the webhook URL, make sure the port is available for requests. Otherwise the webhook will not work. Basic auth (optional) To require basic authentication for the webhook, select Add basic auth, and provide the user name and password to authenticate the webhook. Custom headers (optional) To include headers with webhooks, select Add custom headers, and provide the name and value for each header. Use custom payload (optional) To use the default values, leave blank. To view and edit the default values, select Add custom payload. Payload (for custom payloads only) Your customized POST message code. This field includes: A list of variables you can use Syntax highlighting, based on payload type Payload type (for custom payloads only) Specify the message format: JSON (default) or Form. xMatters You must have an existing xMatters account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) Name your channel so you can identify it easily when associating it with a policy. Integration url (required) The unique integration url provided by xMatters pointing to your xMatters account. Receive mobile push notifications Important In order to receive mobile push notifications, your device must be registered and listed in (account) > User preferences. If the device is not listed in User preferences, log out of the app, log back in, and check again to see if it is listed. To receive mobile push notifications: Log in to your New Relic account via the mobile app at least once to ensure the device is registered. Add the user channel to the alert policy. Switch push notifications On for the device. Acknowledge alert notifications Anyone in your account can acknowledge notifications through the user interface or email notification. Acknowledging an incident in New Relic also acknowledges any associated incident in PagerDuty.",

      "body": "Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Install Snapcraft, and then run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Install Homebrew, and then run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Install Scoop, and then run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Copy or write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity Using your entity guid, you can add tags right away. Invoke the entities tags create command. If you want to add multiple tags, use tag sets: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "What is MLOps? MLOps stands for machine-learning operations. As more companies invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, there's a gap in understanding between the data science teams developing machine-learning models and the DevOps teams operating the applications that power those models. MLOps provides a tool for monitoring and observing the performance and effectiveness of machine-learning models in a production environment. This increases the possibilities for collaboration between data science and DevOps teams, feeding into a continuous process of development, testing, and operational monitoring. The Algorithmia integration Algorithmia Insights provides tools for deploying your machine-learning models into production. By integrating, Algorithmia's integration with New Relic, you'll be able to instrument, analyze, troubleshoot, and optimize your machine-learning performance across your entire system. By rigorously observing your capabilities, you'll be able to react quickly to changes in the model's input or output and the relationship between the two. Send your model performance metrics from Algorithmia Insights to New Relic and you'll have real-time monitoring for your algorithms. You'll explore your metrics data with user-friendly charts and learn the state of your algorithms at a glance for faster and more efficient troubleshooting. Integrate Algorithmia with New Relic First, Algorithmia uses a Kafka topic to stream Insights. Your machine-learning algorithm's performance metrics. Then, the New Relic connector (another algorithm) transforms the Kafka topic into a metrics data payload for a specific New Relic account. Algorithmia uses Kafka and Event Flows to send data to New Relic. With Algorithmia’s Event Flows, when a new message is set to your Kafka topic, your configured New Relic connector algorithm gets called. The connector transforms your metrics and sends them to your New Relic account. Connect your Algorithmia data to New Relic By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Algorithmia machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance.

      "body": "The second version of our StatsD integration was released on May 25 2020. It's an improvement on our first StatsD integration. Improvements include: simpler configuration, and a simpler method for adding tags (key-value pairs). Features Our StatsD integration (version 2) lets you easily get StatsD-format data into New Relic. You can also add any arbitrary tags (key-value pairs) to your data. Once your metrics are in New Relic, you can query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Requirements This integration uses our Metric API and our Event API to ingest data. To use these APIs, you'll need an Insert API key. The integration adheres to the Metric API requirements and data limits. The default rate limit is 100,000 data points per minute (DPM). If you think you're missing metrics or sending more than 100K DPM, see Request data changes. To see if your account is hitting the rate limit, run the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' FACET category, message LIMIT 100 since 1 day ago Copy Install This section will explain how to do a standard install. If you want to run StatsD in Kubernetes, see Kubernetes install. To install the StatsD integration, run the following command and include your New Relic account ID and New Relic Insert API key. This generates a TOML configuration file used by gostatsd. docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy If your account is in the EU data center region, add this to the above command: -e NR_EU_REGION=true \\ Copy After installing, you can: Do optional additional configuration Define your metrics Add custom tags to your data Create alerts Install for Kubernetes Here are examples of Kubernetes manifests for deployment and service objects: Kubernetes manifest examples Below are examples of Kubernetes manifests to deploy StatsD in a Kubernetes environment and create a StatsD service named newrelic-statsd. You need to insert your account ID and your license key. deployment.yml: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: selector: matchLabels: app: newrelic-statsd replicas: 2 revisionHistoryLimit: 2 template: metadata: labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: containers: - name: newrelic-statsd image: newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 env: - name: NR_ACCOUNT_ID value: \"NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID\" - name: NR_API_KEY value: \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy service.yml: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: newrelic-statsd port: 80 targetPort: 8125 protocol: UDP selector: app: newrelic-statsd Copy For configuration details, see Kubernetes configuration. Configure In the install procedure, you run nri-statsd with environment variables, and this generates a TOML configuration file. Additionally, you can set these configuration options: Configuration options Description expiry-interval string If a metric is not updated for this amount of time, we stop reporting that metric. Default is 5m. If you want to send the metrics only if the value was updated between the flush intervals, configure this to 1ms. To never expire metrics, set it to 0. percent-threshold list of integers Specifies the percentiles used for metrics aggregation. Default: 90. metrics-addr string Indicates address on which to listen for metrics. Default: :8125. Tip To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the StatsD integration you must define the following endpoints in the custom configuration: address = 'https://gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/ $NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' Copy address-metrics = 'https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' Copy Here are some examples of customizing configuration by overwriting the default configuration: Example of custom configuration # Specify after how long do we expire metrics, default:5m expiry-interval = '1ms' # percent-threshold specify a list of percentiles for metrics aggregation, default:90 percent-threshold = [90, 99] backends='newrelic' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy Disable timer sub-metrics: By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. If you want to disable those metrics you can do it by adding a disabled-sub-metrics configuration section and set true for the ones you want disabled. Here's an example: # disabled-sub-metrics configuration section allows disabling timer sub-metrics [disabled-sub-metrics] # Regular metrics count=false count-per-second=false mean=false median=false lower=false upper=false stddev=false sum=false sum-squares=false # Percentile metrics count-pct=false mean-pct=false sum-pct=false sum-squares-pct=false lower-pct=false upper-pct=false Copy Docker: overwrite default configuration To overwrite the default nri-statsd configuration while running in a container, you can mount a configuration file inside the container. You can adopt the following template as needed for your situation. Example: backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To run the container with the file mounted in the appropriate path: docker run \\ ... -v ${PWD}/nri-statsd.toml:/etc/opt/newrelic/nri-statsd.toml \\ ... newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Kubernetes: overwrite default configuration The best approach to configure nri-statsd running in Kubernetes is to use a configMap and mount the configMap into the container. (This is a similar process to mounting the configuration file in Docker.) Example: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-statsd-config namespace: default data: nri-statsd.toml: | backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = '$NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To use the configMap, declare a volume on your deployment spec template and then declare a volumeMount on your container spec. Example: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment spec: template: spec: containers: .... volumeMounts: - mountPath: /etc/opt/newrelic/ name: nri-statsd-config volumes: - name: nri-statsd-config configMap: name: nri-statsd-config Copy Metric format The integration receives metrics using the StatsD protocol. Optionally, the sample rate can be configured and tags can be added. Here's the metric data format we use: <metric name>:<value>|<type>|@<sample rate>|#<tags> Copy Here are explanations of these fields: Field name Description < metric name> string Required. Name of the metric. < value> string Required. The metric type: c = counter g = gauge ms = timer @ < sample rate> float Optional for simple counters or timer counters. When many metrics must be sent, you can use sampling to reduce network traffic. The downside is a reduction in the resolution of the data. An example of how this would work for sample rates below 1: If you set this to 0.1, the counter would send a measurement one out of every 10 times. # < tags> string Optional. Tags attached to your metrics are converted into attributes (key-value pairs). For more on tagging options, see Tags. Metric types Here are the types of metrics and how to format them: Counter A counter measures the number of occurrences of an event. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. A counter can be incremented or decremented during the same flush interval by adding a sign to the value. In the following example, the counter value will be 2: counter:4|c counter:-2|c Copy At each flush, the current count is sent and reset to 0. If the count is not updated, at the next flush it will send the value 0. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Here’s an example of a counter that is being sampled 1 out of 10 times: counter:4|c@0.1 Copy Gauge A gauge represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include temperature, CPU usage, and memory. Here's an example: temperature:40|g Copy If the gauge is not updated, at the next flush it will send the previous value. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Timer The timer metric type measures timing data. By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. These are sent as sub-metrics in the following format: <metric_base_name>.std_dev <metric_base_name>.median <metric_base_name>.summary <metric_base_name>.sum_squares <metric_base_name>.mean <metric_base_name>.per_second Copy The configured percentiles will generate the following metrics. The percentile threshold value will be attached as a tag. <metric_base_name>.sum_squares.percentiles <metric_base_name>.sum.percentiles <metric_base_name>.count.percentiles <metric_base_name>.upper.percentiles <metric_base_name>.mean.percentiles Copy The percentile threshold can be tweaked with the percent-threshold config option. These can be controlled through the disabled-sub-metrics configuration section. Add tags (attributes) You can add tags to your data, which we save as attributes (key-value pairs). There are two options for adding tags: Add default tags that apply to all metrics: These apply to all metrics. They are fixed and don't change over time. Add metric-level tags: These apply to specific metrics and allow the value to be changed between two submits. Add default tags that apply to all metrics Add tags to metrics and events by defining an environment variable in the startup command. Here's an example that would create two tags: -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" Copy Here's that environment variable used in the startup command: docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Add metric-level tags When defining the metric format, you can add tags using this format: <bucket name>:<value>|<type>|#<tags> Copy In this example, <tags> is a comma-separated list of tags. Tags format is: simple or key:value. Here's an example NRQL query that includes a custom tag: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE environment = 'production' Copy Create alerts You can alert on StatsD data using NRQL alert conditions. Alert example This procedure walks you through sending some sample data and then creating an alert condition using that data. First, send this data to New Relic’s StatsD container: echo \"prod.test.num:32|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Next, create a NRQL alert condition using this query: SELECT latest(prod.test.num) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'prod.test.num' Copy Here's an image showing creating this NRQL alert condition. Notice that the sample data sent in is represented by the blue dot on the upper right of the chart. Now we can create the alert condition with these settings: Remember to set the Condition name. If a metric with a value above 50 is sent, then an incident is created and notified. The incident is closed automatically after 24 hours. To test that the alert is working, run this command: echo \"prod.test.num:60|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Find and use data To query your data, you'd use any New Relic query option. For example, you might run a NRQL query like: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'myMetric' and environment = 'production' Copy For more on how to query the Metric data type, see Query metric data.

This doc explains how to use our NerdGraph API to add and manage tags. For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Read tags for an entity To construct these queries and see responses: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to find the entity and then fetch its tags. Use NerdGraph's tag API to read the existing tags and their values. In this example, our entity is a browser app called Cookie Checkout: { actor { entitySearch (query: \"name like 'Cookie Checkout'\") { results { entities { tags { key values } } } } } } Copy The actual values vary depending on your data. Use the New Relic GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Add tags for an entity To add new tags for an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity you want to tag. Use the taggingAddTagsToEntity mutation to add a tag with a value to the entity. In this example, we have a browser application called Cookie Checkout owned by a UI team. We want to add a team tag with a ui value to this instance. Once the tag is added, we can filter by the tag team:ui and find the Cookie Checkout app in the New Relic One UI. mutation { taggingAddTagsToEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: { key: \"team\", values: [\"ui\"]}) { errors { message } } } Copy Remove a tag from an entity To delete a tag and all of its associated values from an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation removes the team tag from an entity: mutation { taggingDeleteTagFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagKeys: [\"team\"]) { errors { message } } } Copy Delete specific tag values for an entity Instead of deleting an entire tag and all of its values, you can delete a single tag value. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation deletes the ui value from the tag key: mutation { taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagValues : [{key: \"team\" value: \"ui\"}]) { errors { message } } } Copy Because tagValues is an array, you can delete multiple specific values from a single entity in one mutation. Replace all tag values for an entity To replace the entity’s entire set of tags with the provided tag set: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity mutation. In this example, the Cookie Checkout browser application was transferred from the ui team to the cookie-dev team. You can replace the tag values for team with the following mutation: mutation { taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: {key: \"team\" values: [\"cookie-dev\"]}) { errors { message } } } Copy",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). And you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads for a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. Tip At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Keep reading to learn more about tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can apply tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries and charts As explained in Tag sources, some attributes are available as tags. You can query attributes and create custom charts using NRQL.",

      "body": "Whether you've recently completed your cloud migration, have been using cloud-based services for a while, or have always been in the cloud, you may find yourself deploying modern, cutting-edge technologies and services. It's important to develop the ability to adopt new services easily and with confidence; innovation never stops for companies operating in the cloud, and a company's willingness to embrace new technology can give it a major competitive differentiator. These modern technologies could be container solutions such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Amazon AWS ECS or Fargate, for example. Or they could be serverless services such as AWS Lambda, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform Functions. They may be cloud-based databases, or any number of cloud services that abstract the service away from an operations-maintained infrastructure. In these situations, you want to monitor, query, and alert on the performance and usage metrics for both modern technologies and cloud-based services. This allows your team to deploy faster, to adopt new services with confidence, to make better business decisions, and in general to expand its technology horizons. Here are the steps to using the New Relic Platform to monitor your modern technologies and cloud services: 1. Identify services and technologies Determine the components you need to monitor by answering the following questions: What cloud-based applications do I have? What are the underlying cloud-based services, technologies, and infrastructure supporting those applications? When you have a full understanding of your architecture, you reduce the possibility of missing dependencies and new services that might impact your organization's application environment. 2. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the Infrastructure agent on the hosts you identified in Step One so that you can monitor your cloud services. If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. 3. Configure cloud integrations As you integrate new cloud services, you can use New Relic to monitor and report data about these services; giving you a single, comprehensive overview of your entire architecture. To configure cloud service integrations, link your Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service provider account with New Relic. 4. Track data on your dashboards New Relic Infrastructure integrations auto-populate dashboards with metrics from cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP so you can track the data that is critical to your cloud adoption success. Tip If you adopt a hybrid cloud of multiple cloud providers, New Relic can provide a holistic perspective that is agnostic to cloud providers. AWS EC2 monitoring integration dashboard In this default dashboard for the AWS EC2 monitoring integration, New Relic captures metrics for EC2 instances per region, instance state, and instance type. The dashboard also shows inventory for different software packages and configurations that are installed on those instances. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Amazon Web Services: View AWS EC2 data on the default dashboard for the AWS EC2 monitoring integration. Azure VMs monitoring integration dashboard The default Azure virtual machine integration dashboard shows data for VM sizes, VMs per region, and VMs per resource group. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Microsoft Azure: View Azure virtual machine data on the default dashboard for the Azure VMs monitoring integration. GCP Compute Engine monitoring integration dashboard In this default dashboard for the Google Cloud Platform, New Relic captures metrics for instances per zone, instance status, firewall dropped packets, reserved cores, and disk throttled operations. The dashboard also shows inventory for different software packages and configurations that are installed on those instances. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Google Cloud Platform: View GCP Compute Engine data on the default dashboard for the GCP Compute Engine monitoring integration. Example modern and cloud services dashboard In this example dashboard, three different cloud vendors, modern technologies, cloud services, infrastructure instance locations, and DevOps widgets are combined for an overall view. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Here is an example of an Insights dashboard with data about vendors, technologies, services, instances, and other important details for DevOps teams. 5. Add alerts for cloud-based metrics When monitoring cloud-based services, it is essential to keep track of all changes to a system by alerting on them. Integrations with New Relic Infrastructure allow you to create alerts on the metrics that are the most important to you. Here is an example of a baseline alert that will notify you based on the number of requests received on all AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ALB) systems for the ALB monitoring integration: alerts.newrelic.com > Alert policies > (selected policy) > Alert conditions: Create a NRQL baseline alert to monitor the number of requests received your ALB systems. 6. Set up additional monitoring In addition to monitoring cloud services, you can deploy New Relic APM, Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics to gain full-stack visibility into all of the components of your applications: Use New Relic APM to report application-tier performance metrics. Use New Relic Browser to report front-end web metrics. Use New Relic Mobile to report front-end mobile app metrics. Use New Relic Synthetics to monitor websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. 7. CI/CD pipeline integration It's important to track deployments and the impact that code and infrastructure changes have on your end-user experience. New Relic APM deployment markers allow you to record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened. You can pair markers with metadata from your source code management (SCM) system ( including user IDs, revisions, and change logs.). APM displays a vertical line, or marker, on charts and graphs at the deployment event's timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. Tracking deployments is an invaluable way to determine the root causes of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your applications. Recommendation: Make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment, as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate CI/CD deployments: Chef (see newrelic_deployment) Jenkins Ansible Puppet 8. AWS Lambda Monitoring New Relic One features an updated APM agent that is highly optimized from a cost and time perspective for ephemeral Lambda functions. Enable New Relic monitoring of AWS Lambda to to assess invocations, error rate, function duration, cold starts, and more. You can also take advantage of New Relic's Infrastructure integration with Lambda for additional reporting capabilities.",

      "body": "One of the ways to report custom data to New Relic is with custom events and attributes. Have questions about why you'd use custom data? See Introduction to custom data. Requirements For event and attribute formatting requirements and best practices, see Limits and requirements. Avoid rate limits Reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance. It may also result in approaching or passing data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Example use cases Two popular custom data solutions are custom events and custom attributes. There are several ways to accomplish this (more on that later in this doc), depending on your New Relic implementation and tools. Here are some common use cases for implementing custom events and attributes. Using custom attributes Custom attributes are often used to add important business and operational context to existing events. Business context might include: Customer token Customer market segment Customer value classification Workflow control values not obvious in the URIStem User/product/account privilege context Operational context might include: Which feature flags were used What datastore was accessed What cache was accessed What errors were detected and ignored (fault partitioning) Using custom events Event data is one of New Relic's four core data types. We recommend reading that definition to understand what we mean by \"event\" and why that data type is most used for reporting specific types of activity. The use cases for custom events varies widely: basically they are used for any type of activity that an organization deems important and that is not already being monitored. A couple examples: An event might represent an activity involving multiple actions, like a customer purchasing a certain combination of products. An event might record backup activity. For example, they might set up reporting of events that represent production backups of their SOLR instances into an event table, with a timestamp of when it occurred, which cluster, and the duration. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser monitoring agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the Browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via Browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure monitoring agent Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile monitoring agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetic monitoring Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools. For ways to report other types of custom data, see: Metric API Logs Trace API Extend data retention To learn how to extend how long events are retained in your account, see our documentation about event data retention.",

Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and error_beacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. Currently Infinite Tracing is not FedRAMP compliant.",

Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime Use native deploy To use Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with your Node.js app: Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Optional: Set environment variables to configure the Node.js agent's GAE app.yaml file. Use the Google Cloud SDK's gcloud command line tool to deploy GAE apps. To deploy your Node.js app to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project new-relic-apm-nodejs app deploy Copy Google App Engine automatically includes your Node.js app's newrelic.js configuration file in the deployed package. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. You can deploy the app without any special configuration.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using Full-Stack Observability options like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance.

You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your New Relic APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

Page actions and views Use the Browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Subscription level This feature requires a Browser Pro subscription. The instrumentation level setting for an application does not affect the availability of JavaScript API functions. Agent version Your New Relic Browser agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 60 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 60-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the Browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default Browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute Browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the Browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute Browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual Browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default Mobile events using the New Relic Mobile SDK. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple Mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the Mobile crash event trail. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default Mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams. Be sure to follow your organization's obligations for notices and consent regulations. Deprecated methods As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create custom events. The recordEvent methods for Android and iOS are deprecated. The deprecated recordEvent events do not have their own event type; they are recorded as a Mobile event type with a category attribute value of custom. recordCustomEvent creates an event with an eventType you can assign. But the eventType should only be used for one or two high-level event types, not for naming events. For example, you might have one event type Gestures, with many different names under that one type. For more context on this, see the recordCustomEvent query example.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",

Tip Access your data easily in one.newrelic.com: Click the Browse data dropdown, then select the data type (metrics, events, logs, and traces) you want to explore. Use NRQL or PromQL-style queries in the UI There are two ways to write your own queries to retrieve data and build charts: Query builder in NRQL mode: query using New Relic query language (NRQL), the same language we use to build most of our UI experiences. Query builder in PromQL-style mode: write basic queries using a PromQL-style query. Query using simple UI interfaces New Relic One offers several experiences that don't require knowledge of NRQL: Data explorer: an intuitive data navigator to create visualizations for events and metrics. Query builder (basic mode): a simple, query-less, chart-building experience. Distributed tracing query: a specialized UI for querying traces. Logs query: a specialized UI for querying New Relic Logs data. Query data via API You can use APIs to retrieve and query your data in New Relic.

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that each require their own type of API key to use. This resource describes our API keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. Manage API keys in UI Here's a direct link to the API keys UI page. To find this from the New Relic UI: From the account dropdown, select Account settings. Select API keys. Overview of API keys The table below summarizes our available API keys and their uses. Important Some keys are able to be used by more than one API. If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. Key type What it's for Where to access User key (Also known as a \"personal API key\") Used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints (dependent on user permissions). API keys UI License key Allows ingestion of data from APM agents, the infrastructure agent, and some other data-ingest APIs. API keys UI Insights insert key (Also known as a \"Insert key\") Allows ingestion of events via HTTPS request from our metric, log, trace, and event APIs and the tools that use those APIs. Go to the API keys UI and click Insights insert key. Browser key Allows ingestion of browser monitoring data. API keys UI Mobile key (aka \"mobile app token\") Allows mobile monitoring data to be sent to New Relic. See Mobile app token. REST API key Note: we recommend using the user key instead because it has fewer limitations. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, Browser, Infrastructure alerts, as well as Mobile REST APIs and the API Explorer. Go to the API keys UI and click REST API key. Admin API key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. For more information, see Admin key and User key below. API keys UI (will appear as user keys) Insights query key (aka \"Query key\") This key allows use of the Insights query API. Note: we now recommend using NerdGraph to query New Relic data. Go to the API keys UI and click Insights query key. User key New Relic user keys (previously referred to as \"personal API keys\") are required for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API), which allows you to query most New Relic data and do some types of configuration. User keys also let you use our REST API, with restrictions based on your permissions. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a user key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select User. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key. In the Notes field, add relevant details about the key. Click Create. Edit a user key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the user key you want to edit, click ... and select Edit. Make your changes and click Update key. Delete a user key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the user key you want to delete, click ... and select Delete. Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. Tip In December 2020, user keys supplanted Admin API keys. For details, see Admin API key. License key New Relic license keys allow the ingestion of data from APM agents, the infrastructure agent, and some other data-ingest APIs. If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required or recommended. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a license key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select License. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key. In the Notes field, add relevant details about the key. Click Create. Edit a license key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the license key you want to edit, click ... and select Edit. Make your changes and click Update key. Delete a license API key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the license key you want to delete, click ... and select Delete. Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. Important You can't manage or delete an original license key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Browser key The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a browser key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select Browser. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key. In the Notes field, add relevant details about the key. Click Create. Edit a browser key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the browser API key you want to edit, click ... and select Edit. Make your changes and click Update key. Delete a browser key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the browser API key you want to delete, click ... and select Delete. Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. Important You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. REST API key Important We recommend using a user key to use the REST API because that key has fewer limitations. You can use a REST API key with our REST API and the API Explorer. For parent accounts with sub-accounts, each sub-account must use its own REST API key. Availability: Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. Activate or change REST API key Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Click Regenerate REST API key. Click (Show key) to view your account's new REST API key. Copy your account's REST API key to use with New Relic's REST API. View REST API keys To view REST API keys: Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Click (Show key) to view your account's new REST API key. Delete REST API key To delete your account's REST API key: Before you delete an API key, make sure you have the correct account or sub-account. Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Select the delete icon for the REST API key. Confirm the deletion by typing DELETION IS FOREVER in the text field. Select Delete. Insights insert key The Insights insert key (aka the \"Insert key\") is required for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. Generate an Insights insert key Go to the API keys UI and select Insights insert keys. Next to the Insert keys heading, select the button. A cURL command containing your insert key will appear, as well as NRQL query field. Edit the NRQL query field. Add comments in the Notes field if desired. Click Save your notes. Edit or delete an Insights insert key Go to the API keys UI and select Insights insert keys. Under Insert Keys, find the key you want to modify. Select Edit or Delete. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. Generate an Insights query key You must have access to the UIs you plan to query and the correct permissions in order to register or modify this key. Important Insights query keys are generated per account; they're not associated with a specific user. This means that any user in an account with access to a query key can use it. To register this key: Go to the API keys UI and select Insights query keys. Next to the Query Keys heading, select the button. A cURL command containing your insert key will appear, as well as NRQL query field. Edit the NRQL query field. Add comments in the Notes field if desired. Click Save your notes. Edit or delete an Insights query key To edit or delete this key: Go to the API keys UI page and select Insights query keys. Under Query Keys, find the key you want to modify. Select Edit or Delete. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily.",

      "body": "Use New Relic's metrics API service to define rules for creating metrics from your other types of data, such as events, logs, or spans. Recommendation: Before you begin, review our requirements and tips for creating rules. Create a metrics rule To create a rule for creating metrics from events, logs, or spans: Construct the metrics rule using NRQL. Construct a NerdGraph (GraphQL format) API request that contains your NRQL rule. Create the metric by making the API request. Once a metric is created, you can query and chart it using NRQL. Step 1. Create NRQL query rule The most important part of creating a metrics rule is constructing the NRQL query that defines the metric for your data from events, logs, or spans. You can create up to 10 metrics with a single NRQL query by following this procedure: Using New Relic's NRQL interface, construct a query for the metric you want to create. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT average(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy Edit the query to use one of the three available metric types: summary: Use if the query's function is min, max, sum, count, or average. uniqueCount: Use if the query's function is uniqueCount. distribution: Use if the query's function is percentile or histogram. This example query uses average, so use summary: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary (ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy This example query uses count on a non-numeric field: FROM ProcessSample SELECT count(hostname) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy For summary on a non-numeric field use summary(1): FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(1) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy Tip For more detailed information on using these metric types in rules, see Creating metric rules: requirements and tips. Decide on the attributes you want to attach to the metric, following the limits on the cardinality of unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations. Recommendation: Run a separate query to ensure this count isn't over 50,000 for a 24-hour window. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT uniqueCount(awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy To be able to aggregate and filter your metrics, add the attributes you want to attach to the metric using the FACET clause. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Set the name of the metric using the AS function. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Once your NRQL rule is complete, use it to create the API request. Step 2. Create API request After you build the NRQL rule to convert data from events, logs, or spans to metrics, continue with building the API request. You can use our NerdGraph API tool to explore the data structure and to construct and make your request. To check that the rule was created correctly, you can run a query to return that rule using its ID. For tips on querying the metrics you've created, see Query and chart your metrics. Example NerdGraph API request The following example NerdGraph API request uses the same NRQL rule from step 1. The IO Total Read Bytes Rule creates a metric named io.totalread.bytes. (The rule name can have spaces, which differs from the metric naming rules.) mutation { eventsToMetricsCreateRule(rules: { name: \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", description:\"Created by Zach on March 27, 2019. Used by team Network.\", nrql:\"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\", accountId: 123456 }) { successes { id name nrql enabled } failures { submitted { name nrql accountId } errors { reason description } } } } Copy In this request: Request elements Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsCreateRule The method being called to create a rule. rules Takes four parameters: name: The name of the rule. description: Optional. The description of the rule. We recommend you include information about who created the metric data and who will be using the data. accountId: The New Relic account ID where the events, logs, or spans live and the metrics will be created. nrql: The NRQL query that creates the rule. For more on this, see Create NRQL query. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a successful or failed response. Available parameters for these blocks include: id (ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled (enabled/disabled status) accountId ruleId and accountId If a failure occurs, then the submitted ruleId and accountId will be returned along with the error reason and error description. Example NerdGraph API response Here's an example of a returned response: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsCreateRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"46\", \"name\": \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", \"nrql\": \"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\" } ] } } } Copy Step 3. Create a metrics rule with API request When your API request is ready, you can use the NerdGraph API to make the request, which will create the metrics. Query and chart your metrics After you create a metrics rule to convert data for your events, logs, or spans, you can view the new metric data in the New Relic UI. To view your data: Go to New Relic's NRQL query interface. Run the following query to see the name of all your metrics: SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric Copy Pick the metric of interest, then run the following query to see the available attributes: SELECT * FROM Metric where metricName = 'yourMetric' Copy If you don't see expected data, follow the troubleshooting procedures. The available NRQL aggregator functions depend on the metric type you created. Here are some examples. Summary metric example If you created a summary metric type, you can use the count, sum, max, min, and average aggregator functions, as shown in the following query: SELECT count(appStartResponseTime), sum(appStartResponseTime), max(appStartResponseTime), min(appStartResponseTime), average(appStartResponseTime) FROM Metric Copy Count metric example If you created a uniqueCount metric type, you can only use the uniqueCount function, as shown in the following query: SELECT uniqueCount(playbackErrorStreamUniqueCount) * 100 / uniqueCount(streamUniqueCount) AS '% of Streams Impacted' FROM Metric Copy Distribution metric example If you created a distribution metric type, use the percentile or histogram functions, as shown in the following queries: SELECT percentile(service.responseTime, 95) FROM Metric Copy OR SELECT histogram(service.responseTime, 10, 20) FROM Metric Copy Troubleshooting If your NerdGraph call is not constructed correctly, you may receive a message like this: Cannot parse the unexpected character \"\\u201C” Copy Verify the quotes in the NerdGraph call are not smart quotes (curly quotes). Our NerdGraph API only accepts straight quotes.",

      "body": "Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Install Snapcraft, and then run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Install Homebrew, and then run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Install Scoop, and then run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Copy or write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity Using your entity guid, you can add tags right away. Invoke the entities tags create command. If you want to add multiple tags, use tag sets: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] }, \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostConditions directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your module.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add module.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline.

Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "You can use alerts to set up notification channels, and attach those channels to policies. Your selected channels provide fast and consistent ways for the right personnel to be notified about incidents. For example, notifications allow you to include charts about the incident to provide context and share them with your team. Alerts offers several notification channels, including webhooks, Slack rooms, email, and more. You'll be notified by your notification channels when incidents are opened, acknowledged, or closed. This document explains the available notification channels and how to set them up. Tip This document is about alerts notifications. For general information about unsubscribing from other New Relic emails, including marketing emails, weekly reports, and announcements, see Unsubscribe from New Relic emails. View notification channels To see all notification channels in your account: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. Add or remove notification channels To set up a new notification channel: On the Notification channels, click New notification channel. Select the type of channel and complete other required steps for it. To add or remove a notification policy or channel: Select a specific notification channel, select Alert policies, and add or remove a policy. OR Select a specific policy, select Notification channels, and add or remove a channel. Instructions for specific notification channels These are the available notification channel types. User Requirement: This feature is not available for users on the New Relic One user model, only to users on the original user model (learn about user model differences). As a workaround, you can use the email notification channel. Use the User notification channel to select existing account team members and admins. To view the Users list or to add users to alert policies: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. If a user has configured the New Relic mobile app, the user notification channel also sends push notifications to any of the user's registered mobile devices. If your account has one or more sub-accounts, the notification channel includes only users for the currently selected master or sub-account. Email We automatically add every individual and their email address on the selected account to the User notification channel and you can select them there. You don't need to add existing New Relic accounts to the Email channel. To add an email channel for other users, follow these guidelines: Field Description Email (required) In general, use the Email notification channel to identify user emails or email aliases that are not already on the selected account. For example, if you have a dev-ops@company.com email alias for your DevOps team, add the email alias to the Email channel. Otherwise, use the User notification channel to select specific users on your DevOps team. For easier maintenance, add a single non-user email address or alias to a single alert notification channel. If you want to use the email channel for more than one email, create an email group or alias outside your account. These email addresses can be the same as or different from email addresses already on your account. Users can unsubscribe from general (non-alerts-related) emails, but they cannot unsubscribe from alerts email notifications. Instead, the account Owner, Admin, or add-on manager must remove users from the policy's email notification channel. Include JSON attachment (optional) To include a JSON attachment with the email notification, select this checkbox. OpsGenie You must have an existing OpsGenie account integrated with New Relic in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the OpsGenie notification channel (maximum 64 characters). API key (required) The API key generated from your OpsGenie integration used to authenticate API requests. Teams (optional) List of team names that are responsible for the alert. OpsGenie runs team escalation policies to calculate which users will receive notifications. Tags (optional) A comma-separated list of labels attached to the alert. Tip To overwrite the OpsGenie Quiet Hours setting for urgent alerts, add an OverwriteQuietHours tag. Recipients (optional) One or more names of users, groups, on-call schedules, escalation policies, etc., that OpsGenie uses to calculate where to send notifications. PagerDuty You must have an existing PagerDuty account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Service name (required) The name of your service integrating with PagerDuty for notifications. Integration key (required) The unique service identifier used by PagerDuty's Integration API to trigger, acknowledge, and resolve incidents for the service. Slack Before adding Slack notifications, you must create a unique webhook integration using Slack's New Relic integration. If you want web, transaction, server, and mobile alerts to be posted in separate channels, you must set up separate integrations for each one. Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the Slack notification channel (maximum 64 characters); for example, Network Ops Center. URL (required) Copy and paste the New Relic webhook integration URL that you've set up with Slack. For example: https://hooks.slack.com/services/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 Be sure to include https:// in the URL. Do not use http://. Team channel (optional) If used, include # before the name of the Slack channel where alert notifications are sent; for example, #NOC. VictorOps You must have an existing VictorOps account in order to provide the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for this notification channel (maximum 64 characters). For example, if the VictorOps Route key is for your Technical Support team, you could name this channel Tech Support - VictorOps. Key (required) VictorOps generates a unique key for each account. It maps the VictorOps account to its associated integrations. Route key (optional) This key maps the alert or incident to a specific team. Webhook Webhooks are HTTP POST messages containing JSON documents delivered to a destination URL. When an incident is opened, acknowledged, or closed, our webhook feature sends a message to your URL with any relevant information, such as a description of the event and a link back to New Relic. You also have the option to customize the payload in the POST message for further integration into your system. Important If your endpoint does not acknowledge the POST request within 10 seconds, the Alerts UI may indicate a failed notification event for the related incident. Before adding webhook notifications, you must have an endpoint set up to respond with a status code between 200 and 206 after receiving the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the webhook (maximum 64 characters). Base url (required) The endpoint that will receive the POST message and trigger customized behaviors in your system. Caution If you want to include a port number in the webhook URL, make sure the port is available for requests. Otherwise the webhook will not work. Basic auth (optional) To require basic authentication for the webhook, select Add basic auth, and provide the user name and password to authenticate the webhook. Custom headers (optional) To include headers with webhooks, select Add custom headers, and provide the name and value for each header. Use custom payload (optional) To use the default values, leave blank. To view and edit the default values, select Add custom payload. Payload (for custom payloads only) Your customized POST message code. This field includes: A list of variables you can use Syntax highlighting, based on payload type Payload type (for custom payloads only) Specify the message format: JSON (default) or Form. xMatters You must have an existing xMatters account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) Name your channel so you can identify it easily when associating it with a policy. Integration url (required) The unique integration url provided by xMatters pointing to your xMatters account. Receive mobile push notifications Important In order to receive mobile push notifications, your device must be registered and listed in (account) > User preferences. If the device is not listed in User preferences, log out of the app, log back in, and check again to see if it is listed. To receive mobile push notifications: Log in to your New Relic account via the mobile app at least once to ensure the device is registered. Add the user channel to the alert policy. Switch push notifications On for the device. Acknowledge alert notifications Anyone in your account can acknowledge notifications through the user interface or email notification. Acknowledging an incident in New Relic also acknowledges any associated incident in PagerDuty.",

Table can only contain as children <TableHeader> and a function returning <TableRow>s. function () => undefined classNamestring Appends class names to the component. Should be used only for positioning and spacing purposes. compactboolean DEFAULT false Establishes whether the table should render in compact mode (compact mode has narrower rows). In general, use the standard mode, since compact is reserved for data representation, e.g. in a dashboard. itemsany[] DEFAULT [] The items to be used when rendering. They are required when rendering items with a render callback. Each item can have any structure and type possible, and will the corresponding one will be provided when rendering each element list. mainColumnnumber DEFAULT 0 Column containing the main data identifying the row.

This happens when you're lazy loading the items and the items that are about to render cannot be found in the items array. This callback should be used to fetch/load the missing items from the backend or other sources. The returned Promise should be resolved once item data has finished loading. It will be used to determine when to refresh the list with the newly-loaded data. This callback may be called multiple times in reaction to a single scroll event. function ( cursor : {Object // Items to load. ) => undefined onSelectfunction Function called when the user clicks over a row checkbox. It is called with the event of the checkbox, as well as with an object containing the item representing the row, its index in the items array passed to the table, and the items themselves.

Table.SELECTION_TYPE.BULK displays checkboxes per each row, along with a checkbox in the header to select all items. When an item is selected, header actions become available. Table.SELECTION_TYPE.SINGLE doesn't display checkboxes, the user picks a row by just clicking on it. Though not enforced in the component, the selected callback should return true only for one item. Check the examples of the component to see how it works. <One of Table.SELECTION_TYPE.BULK , Table.SELECTION_TYPE.SINGLE , > spacingTypeenum[] Spacing property.

When clicked, sorting information (and the next sorting state) will be passed as the second parameter. Use it rather than computing it yourself. function ( event : Event, sortingData : Object ) => undefined sortableboolean DEFAULT false Whether the column is sortable. This means that the up and down arrows will be shown, side to the heading text. Sorting is a controlled component interface, you are in charge of listening for the sorting event and applying the sorting to the corresponding column, by changing its sortingOrder prop. sortingFunctionfunction Method for sorting rows. The default method will usually do the right thing (alphabetical ordering for text, numerical ordering for numbers and boolean grouping), but if needed this can be overridden. The function takes two parameters (a and b) and has to return a negative number if a is considered to appear before b, a positive one if it's considered to appear after, and zero if both values are identical. Each of the objects passed to the callback contains the value for the given row (i.e. the result of calling value over the row), the row item (as item), the index of the row (as index) and all the items in the items array (as items). Generally you will compare rows using a.item and b.item. function ( a : object, b : object ) => undefined sortingOrdernumber DEFAULT Number . MAX_SAFE_INTEGER Establishes the sorting order. A lowest number indicates a highest sorting priority, meaning that 0 will be the first column sorted, and if two items are identical, we will use column 1 and so on. Columns that do not have an explicit sorting order are used after all columns that do have it, and they are applied in order of appearance. sortingTypeenum DEFAULT TableHeaderCell . SORTING_TYPE . NONE Establishes the sorting for the column. Columns are sorted based on the element returned by the value prop. <One of TableHeaderCell.SORTING_TYPE.ASCENDING , TableHeaderCell.SORTING_TYPE.DESCENDING , TableHeaderCell.SORTING_TYPE.NONE , > styleobject Inline style for custom styling. testIdstring Adds a data-test-id. Used to target the component in unit and e2e testing. titlestring Establishes the title of the cell. This is used for tooltip purposes, when the width of the column is small enough to not show the entire heading. Defaults to the stringified version of the provided children. valuefunction Function that is used to extract the raw value representing a column. The raw value may be a boolean (e.g. if you render a checkbox), a number (if you render a metric) or text for others. It is called with an object containing the item representing the row, its index in the items array passed to the table, and the items themselves. This function is used for sorting the table (by the given value) as well as for the heuristics of 'fit-content' widths. function () => undefined widthstring DEFAULT 1fr Represents the width of the column. It is always a string, and it can be of one of the following types: 'fit-content': the column will take the minimum required space to allocate all items in the column. For virtualized lists, a heuristic will be used to avoid rendering all cells. 'YYpx': where YY is a number, represents the width of the column in pixels. 'YY%': where YY is a number, represents the width of the column in percentage, relative to the size of the available space where the table is being rendered. 'YYfr': where YY is a number, it represents a fraction of the available width. Fractions are proportional ones to others; for instance, a table with two columns (1fr and 2fr) will have the second column twice as large as the first one. If, after computing the widths, the overall size of the table does not cover the available space, all columns will be proportionally stretched to fit all available space.

The account dropdown on the right gets you to your account settings. To access your account settings, in the top right, click your profile icon for all your account-related abilities. In the top left, use the All accounts dropdown menu to switch accounts. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation function You can use NRQL query function, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, with the Browser agent, with the Mobile agent, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure Monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, Infrastructure Monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights At New Relic, Insights used to be the primary way to query and chart your New Relic-reported data. Now, we have the improved query builder. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our Mobile Monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account A master account is a New Relic account that has one or more subordinate accounts (sub-accounts). For details, see Account structure. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, Mobile Monitoring, and Browser Monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile Monitoring Mobile Monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile Monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our Full Stack Observability pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. Tip To use CPMs and synthetic monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a Scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a Simple Browser or Scripted Browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a Runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and Memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "Now that you are using cloud-hosted infrastructure and services, it is important to start looking very early and very closely at your cloud spend: Make sure that your assumptions about your cloud spend are playing out as expected. Quickly catch and correct any unexpected spikes in spending. Start fine-tuning the usage of your cloud-based resources. For example, if you have a set of 20 instances all running at 10% CPU, you can think about using smaller instances or consolidating more work onto those instances. This kind of thinking about your cloud spend helps you optimize and save money quickly. New Relic can help you monitor all this. From a data perspective, it is really just another metric that our platform can collect for you. As with any other metric, you can visualize, report, and alert on your cloud spend data, just like you can with any data New Relic can help you collect. Using the New Relic applied intelligence platform is a great way to help you learn about your cloud spending or about any of your performance data. 1. Deploy the New Relic Infrastructure agent Review the requirements for the New Relic Infrastructure agent and follow the documentation for instructions on installing the agent. After you install the Infrastructure agent on your hosts, you immediately have access to the broad spectrum of metrics that the agent receives automatically. Then, you can set up the cloud integration to start collecting billing information. 2. Create dashboard charts for cloud performance New Relic Dashboards is the product that you use to write powerful custom queries about your data, and then visualize the results in charts that you collect on a dashboard. You can also feed the results of your dashboard queries directly into New Relic Alerts, where you can get notifications on any deviations that you specify. Include charts for various Infrastructure metrics related to performance and usage; for example: CPU Memory Disk Database You may also want to include charts that represent the application using this cloud infrastructure. In this way you can correlate the cloud infrastructure performance with that of the application. As you right-size your cloud infrastructure, you will want to monitor application performance to make sure you are achieving any targets. 3. Configure the Amazon AWS integration New Relic Infrastructure comes with several types of integrations, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and on-host integrations. This tutorial focuses on the AWS Billing integration. First, configure the integration with your AWS account, and then you can set up the AWS Billing integration. 4. Set up billing budgets in AWS The Amazon AWS Billing integration requires some additional configuration on the AWS side. Specifically, you need to go into your AWS Billing dashboard and set up Budgets. Our documentation and the blog post Show Me (Where I’m Spending) the Money! AWS Billing Comes to New Relic Insights provide walk-throughs of this process. When creating Budgets, be sure to: Fill in an application name. Decide whether you are doing cost or service-based budgeting. Decide if your budget is open-ended or has a definite ending date. 5. Add cloud spend and budget widgets to Insights dashboard New Relic Insights is the product that you use to write powerful custom queries about your data, and then visualize the results in widgets that you collect on a dashboard. You can also feed the results of your Insights queries directly into New Relic Alerts, where you can get notifications on any deviations that you specify. 6. Create dashboards for every level of your organization Whether you are a developer, in DevOps, or an executive, having information about your cloud spend can help you optimize your cloud environment. Here are a few ways dashboards can help at each level of your organization: Dashboards for developers Understanding how much applications cost to run helps developers properly configure applications to use more efficient services. For example, could developers save cloud costs using Amazon AWS Lambda or properly sized instances instead of randomly selecting an instance? Dashboards for DevOps Monitoring application costs allows operators to catch possible overruns due to misconfigured services. For example, is the DevOps team’s auto-scaling configuration not scaling down properly? Are they spending money on instances that are not being used? Dashboards for executives An overall view of both forecasted and actual cloud spends for individual applications on a per region basis, as well as total costs, helps executives make better business decisions. Use New Relic to keep control of your cloud spending costs, and get your teams alerted when you go over your budgets. 7. Set up alerts After you write queries on your data in Insights, you can easily use them to create alert conditions. New Relic gives you the ability to write baseline queries against your data. A baseline query is a query that you write without setting hard limits on the results and instead let New Relic Applied Intelligence “machine-learn” your performance data. New Relic alerts you when you go too far outside of your baseline numbers. Configure a baseline query using the forecasted amount Configuring a baseline query using a forecasted amount is a great starting point for monitoring any cloud budget, as you grow to understand what your cloud spend will be over time. New Relic notifies you if something spikes beyond your forecasted trend. That query looks like this: SELECT latest(`provider.forecastedAmount`) FROM FinanceSample WHERE provider = 'BillingBudget' and `provider.budgetName` = 'NAME_OF_YOUR_CLOUD_BUDGET' Copy When you create a baseline query and alert on it, you decide how restrictively Applied Intelligence should analyze your data using a simple slider and visualization based on your recent performance. The slider either increases or decreases the gray band around your budget threshold (the blue line): alerts.newrelic.com > Alert policies > (select a policy) > Alert conditions: Create alert conditions based on your NRQL queries and Insights data. This example would have resulted in zero violations based on recent data, and that is exactly what you are looking for. However, if that blue line spikes up out of the gray band, New Relic notifies you. For more detailed information about creating, managing, and using alerts, view these New Relic University tutorials: Intro to alerting Alert policies Alerting incident lifecycle Notification channels",

      "body": "When building a query using the query builder, there are a variety of types of visualizations for presenting your data in the optimal format. This table contains all chart types. Whether a chart type is available for your query will be dependent on: The type of query (some query results don't match some chart types) The query mode (basic or advanced) Area chart An area chart shows a time series for a single attribute. The area chart type shows a time series for a single attribute. To enable an area chart, add a FACET to your query. Important You can add only one facet in basic mode. In advanced mode, you can use facet to add up to five attributes, separated by commas. Use the TIMESERIES function when you use a FACET in an NRQL query. Use an area chart when you want to View the measurement of a single attribute over a period of time that you specify. Avoid an area chart when you want to View a chart that contains more than a single attribute. The line chart type is a good option; you can view multiple attributes over a time range that you specify. The bar chart type gives you a comparison view between the attributes; it uses a total of each attribute for the time range you choose. Bar chart The bar chart shows comparisons among the categories returned in the query results. The bar chart compares a related set of values. To enable a bar chart, add a FACET clause to the query. Important You can add only one facet in basic mode. You can use FACET with up to 5 different attributes, separated by commas. Use a bar chart when you want to Create a chart that reports the total count of the data for a category over the specified time range. With the bar chart format, you can easily see the differences between each category. Avoid a bar chart when you want to Include measurements over a period of time. This chart type is not available when using a TIMESERIES clause. The line chart type is a good option for this visualization. Billboard The billboard chart type presents results as a single, highly-visible value. It's an option when your query returns a single number, such as from this query: SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView since 1 day ago Copy A billboard chart is useful for single-stat queries like the Apdex function. Use billboards to monitor values at a glance. Billboards can also be used to compare a single value across states. For instance, use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the same attribute across two different time frames. The billboard chart displays a single value in a large, easy to read font. To enable the data for a billboard chart, search for a single value. You can view multiple values by adding a facet from the dropdown. You can set Warning and Critical thresholds on billboards, which will highlight a chart in yellow or red. The threshold fields are on the right side of the chart edit pane, highlighted in yellow and red respectively. If you want to highlight a chart when a value falls below a given value rather than above it, set the Warning threshold higher than the Critical threshold. Tip Threshold fields will only be available for dashboards that present a single value. For instance, the use of a COMPARE WITH clause will disable the threshold settings in the edit pane. Use a billboard chart when you want to Monitor values, including thresholds for Critical and Warning states, in a large, easy-to-read font. Avoid a billboard chart type when You want to view data over a period of time. The line chart type is a better option for viewing data by time. Bullet chart Use the bullet chart type to represent progress to a target or goal, called the limit. To use this chart type, run a query that returns a single number, such as: SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The bullet chart displays a value compared against a limit. Bullet defaults to a limit that is twice the resulting query value. To adjust the limit, use the Limit field to enter another number. The bullet will adjust accordingly. Tip The bullet chart type can only be used for charts that present a single value. For example, a query using COMPARE WITH will not list bullet as an option. Use a bullet chart when you want to View a chart uses a large, easy-to-read font that helps you view the value quickly. Avoid a bullet chart when you want to View data that has more than a single value. Bar and line chart types may be better choices in this instance. Funnel Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data types that make up the steps toward a specified goal. A funnel allows you to ask, “Of the people that did (A), how many also did (B), and of the people that did (A) and (B), how many also completed (C)?” Sample funnel chart for a shopping site. In this example, you want to determine that of all the visitors that viewed the landing page, how many of them: Browsed the products. Then added one or more products to a shopping cart. And finally, purchased the item(s) in the shopping cart. Unlike other queries, you must use a SELECT funnel() statement in your query; the funnel chart type is not selectable from any other type of query. Additionally, the funnel chart type is only available for queries with eight steps or fewer. A funnel query that includes more than eight steps will only return the results as JSON. SELECT funnel(session, WHERE pageUrl like '%/index.html' AS 'Landing', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/browse/phones' AS 'Browse ', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/shoppingcart' AS 'Cart', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/checkout' AS 'Purchased') FROM PageView where appName = 'WebPortal' AND duration < 1 SINCE 1 week ago Copy Use a funnel when you want to You want to visually evaluate the paths that visitors take after they hit a page that you designate as a landing page. Avoid a funnel when you want to You only want counts for the attributes in the WHERE clause. You will not be able to choose funnel unless you use SELECT funnel in your query. Heat map The heat map displays data in a tabular format using color gradations to show frequency in specific time buckets. The heat map is a faceted distribution of values where color density represents the values displayed. To enable a heat map, use the Histogram() function with a numeric attribute and use FACET to add up to five attributes, separated by commas. See Histograms: View data distribution for more detailed information about histogram-based charts. Use a heat map when you want to View tabular data for multiple attributes over a period of time, with gradated colors instead of numerals. Avoid a heat map when you want to View the exact data for multiple attributes over a period of time. A line or bar chart may be an option. Histogram A histogram charts frequency across a series of value ranges. Use histograms to show the distribution of data across time buckets. See Histograms: View data distribution for more detailed information about histogram-based charts. Use a histogram when you want to Chart frequency of data over a series of values. Avoid a histogram when you want to View the same data as heat map or to view the data without the time buckets. JSON Use the returned JSON to review the raw data returned and to help develop integrations with New Relic. To implement integrations, use remote queries to return raw JSON as a service. To use this, select the Share menu and click Copy JSON. Example NRQL query: SELECT uniqueCount(name) FROM Transaction WHERE httpResponseCode = '200' TIMESERIES FACET appName LIMIT 10 SINCE 24 hours ago Copy Example JSON response: { \"metadata\": { \"contents\": { \"messages\": [], \"timeSeries\": { \"messages\": [], \"contents\": [ { \"function\": \"uniquecount\", \"attribute\": \"name\", \"simple\": true } ] }, \"bucketSizeMillis\": 1800000 }, \"eventTypes\": [ \"Transaction\" ], \"eventType\": \"Transaction\", \"openEnded\": true, \"messages\": [], \"beginTimeMillis\": 1556226069396, \"endTimeMillis\": 1556312469396, \"beginTime\": \"2019-04-25T21:01:09Z\", \"endTime\": \"2019-04-26T21:01:09Z\", \"guid\": \"5238a2c6-328d-a5ff-9185-7f3f04c42d1e\", \"routerGuid\": \"1aea2ec5-0be8-3a60-7554-851e1b016eb0\", \"rawSince\": \"24 HOURS AGO\", \"rawUntil\": \"NOW\", \"rawCompareWith\": \"\", \"facet\": \"appName\", \"offset\": 0, \"limit\": 10 }, \"facets\": [ { \"name\": \"RPM Combined Production\", \"beginTimeSeconds\": 0, \"endTimeSeconds\": 0, \"timeSeries\": [ { \"results\": [ { \"uniqueCount\": 415 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 1556226069, \"endTimeSeconds\": 1556227869, \"inspectedCount\": 4589471 }, [ { \"uniqueCount\": 1714 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 1556310669, \"endTimeSeconds\": 1556312469, \"inspectedCount\": 53341469 } ], \"total\": { \"results\": [ { \"uniqueCount\": 2651 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 0, \"endTimeSeconds\": 0, \"inspectedCount\": 5053841114 } }, \"performanceStats\": { \"inspectedCount\": 6088068932, \"responseTime\": 8077 } } ... Copy Line A line chart is useful for spotting trends over time. The line chart plots a timeseries for an attribute. When working in basic query mode, select a single attribute you can plot over time. When using NRQL, SELECT one or more attributes you can plot over time and then use the TIMESERIES function. Use a line chart when you want to Create a chart that lets you easily view trends over a specified time frame. Avoid a line chart when you want to View your data using one or more attributes and see the values associated with each attribute. A bar or table chart is an option. Pie chart A pie chart is the graphic representation of the table. It appears as an option for some functions when the FACET clause is used. To use this chart type, run a query that returns one value for each of a set of attributes. The pie chart maps a set of values as a portion of a whole. To enable pie chart, add a FACET from the dropdown. You can add only one FACET in basic query mode. If you're using NRQL, you can use FACET to add up to 5 attributes, separated by commas, and also include the TIMESERIES function. Pie charts are unavailable for the following aggregator functions: average, apdex, min, max, percentage, and percentile. For uniqueCount, percentages may add up to more than 100%. Use a pie chart when you want to Create a chart that that graphically presents a set of values as they relate to a whole. A pie chart is effective for displaying values for a time period, for example. Avoid a pie chart when you want to Present data that does not use values as they related to a whole, such as with line charts. Pie chart percentage problem When using a pie chart with the uniqueCount aggregator function, the percentages can add up to more than 100%. This is because the attributes being uniquely counted may be present in multiple facets. For example, in the query SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView FACET appName, a single unique user may use multiple apps. Each of these users are included in the unique value for each of the appropriate facets (apps), but the total number of unique users won't change. To solve this, use a bar chart or table to provide a more accurate visualization of uniqueCount data. Table A table is the standard view for a set of values related to a specific attribute (for example, the count of all page views by user agent name). By default, all tables are sortable by any one column. If you are using the FACET clause, the results will normally be returned as a table. Other features of tables: You can use a table as a shortcut to other dashboards. If a table is faceted by attribute, selecting an entry takes you to an existing dashboard filtered by that attribute. You can export a table chart to a CSV file. Details on this functionality: If a filter is applied to a dashboard, the download will only include the subset of data based on the filter. If a specific fixed time range is selected, the CSV includes the data for that time period. If you query with multiple attributes, the export includes columns for all FACETs in the query. For charts with a time range dependent on the present moment (for example, since 30 minutes ago), the data in the CSV is generated from the present moment, not from when the chart was initially generated. The table chart type, with its tabular format, works well for dashboards, as well as sharing the data for use in reports, for example. Use a table when you want to Create a text-compatible table consisting of your data. This table can be shared and used in reports or imported into spreadsheets, for example. Avoid a table when you want to View your data in a graphical format.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostConditions directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your module.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add module.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. Terragrunt is a thin wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state. In this guide, you will use Terragrunt to generate your Terraform configurations, create files with Terragrunt, and reuse the Terragrunt configuration to manage multiple environments. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic Infrastructure agent for your host. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: You will also need to install Terragrunt to follow this guide: bash Copy $ brew install terragrunt To follow the examples in this guide, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 6 Create a new configuration Terragrunt is a wrapper that provides extra tooling for your Terraform configurations. In the next steps, you will create a new configuration using Terragrunt, Terraform, and New Relic. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terragrunt-config && cd terragrunt-config In the new directory, create a terragrunt.hcl file, create a ./src directory, and create a ./environments directory: bash Copy $ touch terragrunt.hcl $ mkdir src $ mkdir environments Inside of your environments folder, create a folder named dev. In the ./src directory, create a main.tf and provider.tf files: bash Copy $ mkdir environments/dev $ touch src/main.tf $ touch src/provider.tf In the provider.tf file add the appropriate Terraform and New Relic provider configuration information: terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } Copy In the main.tf add a New Relic alert policy named DemoPolicy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Copy In the ./environments/dev directory create a new file named terragrunt.hcl bash Copy $ cd ./environments/dev/ $ touch terragrunt.hcl Within the dev folder update the terragrunt.hcl file by adding the following include statement. The include statement tells Terragrunt to use any .hcl confgiuration files it finds in parent folders. include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } Copy Next, add a Terraform block to provide Terragrunt with a Terraform source reference. terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Now you need to configure the provider with your New Relic account details. You will need your New Relic user API key and account ID. provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you have a single account: The account ID is displayed on the API keys page. If your organization has multiple accounts: From one.newrelic.com, select Entity explorer and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page. Tip Documentation about the New Relic provider is provided on the Terraform doc site. Update the provider.tf file to define the New Relic account variables that will help keep the Terraform configuration dynamic. variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy In your terminal, change directories to the environments/dev folder and run the command terragrunt init: bash Copy $ terragrunt init Terraform init sets up a bit of context, sets up environment variables, and then runs terraform init. You will see the following output: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. [terragrunt] [/Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev] 2021/02/02 13:30:31 Copying lock file [output] from /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev/.terragrunt-cache/e-PoBgWhdv3v8QGOtDQxS_WeYu4/ 69zjIFUfApJiUt8gFmi-6-dcPe8/.terraform.lock.hcl to /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy $ terragrunt plan Terragrunt starts to run but pauses to ask for the inputs to the New Relic account variables added to the provider.tf file. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2/02 13:32:08 Running command: terraform plan var.newrelic_account_id Enter a value: Interrupt received. Exit the terragrunt plan process with CTRL+C . In the environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl file, add an inputs block to provide the values for your New Relic account variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy The updated terragrunt.hcl only has the include, terraform, and inputs block include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Now, when you run terragrunt plan, Terragrunt will provide the input block's values, no longer prompting the command line for values. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Run terragrunt apply. After Terraform finishes process, check your New Relic account for the new Demo Policy. Step 2 of 6 Adding to your configuration Now that you have a basic New Relic configuration created, add configurations built in the Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides in this step. Tip If you haven't done the previous developer guides, you can copy the configurations for this section from the Terragrunt Intro Github Repo. Update the main.tf to include the additional terraform configurations. Update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy You have added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. To clone the module from GitHub, run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply. After Terraform is done processing, You will see your Demo Policy now has two conditions in your New Relic account and one alert channel attached. Step 3 of 6 Using your Environment as a Terragrunt Variable Using Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you are running to the name of the data you are creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create a new input for env_name inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy in the main.tf file add a new variable for 'env_name' variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Using string interpolation, add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks. resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to the configuration name. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Currently, the environment variable name is hardcoded into the root terragrunt.hcl file. You want to avoid having your variables hardcoded, using a terragrunt built-in function will pass the value. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use the path_relative_to_include() built-in function and pass the value has the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output, the env_name variable will have the entire ./environments/dev/ path. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Next, update the terragrunt.hcl to only include 'dev' as the env_name variable. Adding a locals block creates a local variable, using the replace built-in function will remove the unwanted parts of the relative path, and update the inputs block to use the local variable. locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output the env_name variable will now have 'dev:' added. Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Step 4 of 6 Storing the State Remotely At the moment, the state file is local. The next steps will update your Terraform configurations to remove the local state file and use a file stored remotely in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, various state files will need to be store in separate S3 buckets, not to override each other. Terragrunt allows you to generate files on the fly. Adding the remote_state block into the root level terragrunt.hcl file, you will generate a new file named backend.tf. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"my-terraform-state\" key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true } } Copy After adding the remote_state block, you will need to give the configuration for the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state. Tip To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Now, update the remote_state block to provide your S3 bucket and update the key to use the local environment variable created previously. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Next, run terragrunt plan. If you look in the Amazon S3 bucket, you will see a folder named envs. Within the envs folder is a directory called devs containing terraform.tfstate file. Tip To see the files created by Terragrunt, look inside of the ./environments/dev directory. There is a hidden directory named terragrunt-cache. Within the terragrunt-cache directory, you will see the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Step 5 of 6 Creating a New Environment Now that you have a working configuration for your dev environment, you will create a new environment reusing the dev configurations in the next steps. In the environments directory, create a new folder names nonprod. In the nonprod folder, create a new terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl In the nonprod terragrunt.hcl file copy over the configuration from the environment terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you are using a different account for your nonprod environment, you can update the inputs with a new New Relic account ID and API key. Inside of your nonprod directory, run terragrunt init then run terragrunt apply. In the output, you will see Terraform has created a new set of resources. The new resources should have the nonprod name prefixed. Step 6 of 6 Terragrunt has created two environments, but there is no difference between them other than the name. Adding variables in the configurations allows your configurations to be more dynamic. In the next steps, you will add variables to your configurations. In the main.tf add new variables for the Host Conditions modules cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage values: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy In the main.tf update the HostConditions module values to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Run terragrunt plan. In the output, the HostConditions values have changed to use the variable defaults. Next, you want to pass the values into your environment configurations by adding the inputs block variables. In the nonprod/terragrunt.hcl file, add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy Run terragrunt apply. In your New Relic account, you will see a new policy with configurations changed based on the environment. Conclusion Congratulations! You've used Terragrunt to generate your New Relic configurations and manage multiple environments. Review the Terragrunt Intro Example, New Relic Terraform provider documentation, and Terragrunt quick start to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "You can use alerts to set up notification channels, and attach those channels to policies. Your selected channels provide fast and consistent ways for the right personnel to be notified about incidents. For example, notifications allow you to include charts about the incident to provide context and share them with your team. Alerts offers several notification channels, including webhooks, Slack rooms, email, and more. You'll be notified by your notification channels when incidents are opened, acknowledged, or closed. This document explains the available notification channels and how to set them up. Tip This document is about alerts notifications. For general information about unsubscribing from other New Relic emails, including marketing emails, weekly reports, and announcements, see Unsubscribe from New Relic emails. View notification channels To see all notification channels in your account: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. Add or remove notification channels To set up a new notification channel: On the Notification channels, click New notification channel. Select the type of channel and complete other required steps for it. To add or remove a notification policy or channel: Select a specific notification channel, select Alert policies, and add or remove a policy. OR Select a specific policy, select Notification channels, and add or remove a channel. Instructions for specific notification channels These are the available notification channel types. User Requirement: This feature is not available for users on the New Relic One user model, only to users on the original user model (learn about user model differences). As a workaround, you can use the email notification channel. Use the User notification channel to select existing account team members and admins. To view the Users list or to add users to alert policies: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. If a user has configured the New Relic mobile app, the user notification channel also sends push notifications to any of the user's registered mobile devices. If your account has one or more sub-accounts, the notification channel includes only users for the currently selected master or sub-account. Email We automatically add every individual and their email address on the selected account to the User notification channel and you can select them there. You don't need to add existing New Relic accounts to the Email channel. To add an email channel for other users, follow these guidelines: Field Description Email (required) In general, use the Email notification channel to identify user emails or email aliases that are not already on the selected account. For example, if you have a dev-ops@company.com email alias for your DevOps team, add the email alias to the Email channel. Otherwise, use the User notification channel to select specific users on your DevOps team. For easier maintenance, add a single non-user email address or alias to a single alert notification channel. If you want to use the email channel for more than one email, create an email group or alias outside your account. These email addresses can be the same as or different from email addresses already on your account. Users can unsubscribe from general (non-alerts-related) emails, but they cannot unsubscribe from alerts email notifications. Instead, the account Owner, Admin, or add-on manager must remove users from the policy's email notification channel. Include JSON attachment (optional) To include a JSON attachment with the email notification, select this checkbox. OpsGenie You must have an existing OpsGenie account integrated with New Relic in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the OpsGenie notification channel (maximum 64 characters). API key (required) The API key generated from your OpsGenie integration used to authenticate API requests. Teams (optional) List of team names that are responsible for the alert. OpsGenie runs team escalation policies to calculate which users will receive notifications. Tags (optional) A comma-separated list of labels attached to the alert. Tip To overwrite the OpsGenie Quiet Hours setting for urgent alerts, add an OverwriteQuietHours tag. Recipients (optional) One or more names of users, groups, on-call schedules, escalation policies, etc., that OpsGenie uses to calculate where to send notifications. PagerDuty You must have an existing PagerDuty account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Service name (required) The name of your service integrating with PagerDuty for notifications. Integration key (required) The unique service identifier used by PagerDuty's Integration API to trigger, acknowledge, and resolve incidents for the service. Slack Before adding Slack notifications, you must create a unique webhook integration using Slack's New Relic integration. If you want web, transaction, server, and mobile alerts to be posted in separate channels, you must set up separate integrations for each one. Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the Slack notification channel (maximum 64 characters); for example, Network Ops Center. URL (required) Copy and paste the New Relic webhook integration URL that you've set up with Slack. For example: https://hooks.slack.com/services/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 Be sure to include https:// in the URL. Do not use http://. Team channel (optional) If used, include # before the name of the Slack channel where alert notifications are sent; for example, #NOC. VictorOps You must have an existing VictorOps account in order to provide the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for this notification channel (maximum 64 characters). For example, if the VictorOps Route key is for your Technical Support team, you could name this channel Tech Support - VictorOps. Key (required) VictorOps generates a unique key for each account. It maps the VictorOps account to its associated integrations. Route key (optional) This key maps the alert or incident to a specific team. Webhook Webhooks are HTTP POST messages containing JSON documents delivered to a destination URL. When an incident is opened, acknowledged, or closed, our webhook feature sends a message to your URL with any relevant information, such as a description of the event and a link back to New Relic. You also have the option to customize the payload in the POST message for further integration into your system. Important If your endpoint does not acknowledge the POST request within 10 seconds, the Alerts UI may indicate a failed notification event for the related incident. Before adding webhook notifications, you must have an endpoint set up to respond with a status code between 200 and 206 after receiving the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the webhook (maximum 64 characters). Base url (required) The endpoint that will receive the POST message and trigger customized behaviors in your system. Caution If you want to include a port number in the webhook URL, make sure the port is available for requests. Otherwise the webhook will not work. Basic auth (optional) To require basic authentication for the webhook, select Add basic auth, and provide the user name and password to authenticate the webhook. Custom headers (optional) To include headers with webhooks, select Add custom headers, and provide the name and value for each header. Use custom payload (optional) To use the default values, leave blank. To view and edit the default values, select Add custom payload. Payload (for custom payloads only) Your customized POST message code. This field includes: A list of variables you can use Syntax highlighting, based on payload type Payload type (for custom payloads only) Specify the message format: JSON (default) or Form. xMatters You must have an existing xMatters account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) Name your channel so you can identify it easily when associating it with a policy. Integration url (required) The unique integration url provided by xMatters pointing to your xMatters account. Receive mobile push notifications Important In order to receive mobile push notifications, your device must be registered and listed in (account) > User preferences. If the device is not listed in User preferences, log out of the app, log back in, and check again to see if it is listed. To receive mobile push notifications: Log in to your New Relic account via the mobile app at least once to ensure the device is registered. Add the user channel to the alert policy. Switch push notifications On for the device. Acknowledge alert notifications Anyone in your account can acknowledge notifications through the user interface or email notification. Acknowledging an incident in New Relic also acknowledges any associated incident in PagerDuty.",

In this guide, you learn how to: Use the nr1 CLI to generate a default visualization Run your visualization locally where you can quickly test and iterate Publish your visualization to the New Relic One catalog Add your visualization to a dashboard Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create a new visualization Use nr1 to generate the boilerplate for a new visualization. Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called my-awesome-visualization, in a Nerdpack, called my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name my-awesome-visualization ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ... my-awesome-nerdpack ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-awesome-nerdpack is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization my-awesome-visualization is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another. Step 4 of 4 In index.js, change your component's Radar.fillOpacity: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 } from 'recharts'; 10 import {Card, CardBody, HeadingText, NrqlQuery, Spinner, AutoSizer} from 'nr1'; 11 12 export default class MyAwesomeVisualizationVisualization extends React.Component { 13 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 14 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Before you begin Explore our custom visualization guides and build your first visualization. After you're done, you'll have a better foundation for building more complex visualizations, such as the one you'll build in this course. Finally, if you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create your visualization Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called radar-or-treemap, in a Nerdpack, called alternate-viz: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name radar-or-treemap ✔ You’re trying to create a visualization outside of a Nerdpack. We’ll create a Nerdpack for you—what do you want to name it? … alternate-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack alternate-viz is available at \"./alternate-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization radar-or-treemap is available at \"./alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/radar-or-treemap directory under alternate-viz: bash Copy $ cd alternate-viz $ ls visualizations/radar-or-treemap index.js nr1.json styles.scss Set up your component state Add component state to the default visualization template that nr1 created for you. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap/index.js. You'll work in here for the rest of this lesson.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type. Use SegmentedControl and SegmentedControlItem to switch between the two chart types. Tip To learn more about the components available in the New Relic One SDK, go to our Intro to New Relic One SDK.

The SegmentedControl and RadarChart are at the top of the view, but if you scroll down, you'll see your new Treemap: Switch between charts with your component's state Use state.selectedChart to determine which chart to show: the RadarChart or the Treemap. Step 1 of 1 Destructure this.state to access selectedChart as a separate constant. Then, compare selectedChart to CHART_TYPES.Radar. If they are the same, render a RadarChart. Otherwise, render a Treemap: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 'Radar': 'radar', 24 'Treemap': 'treemap' 25 } 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] }, \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Alerts & AI. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Create a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

Important Are you a New Relic Insights user? See our transition guide. Why it matters Modern business systems are a complex maze of data-generating elements. You need an easy, solid way to fetch, analyze, and visualize the never-ending stream of data flowing from your daily working activities. Use the query builder to: Quickly access your data and build customized charts to learn and understand the health of your infrastructure, applications, and other services. Add charts to your dashboards to obtain a complete real-time view of the state of your system. Share your charts with colleagues or users in just two clicks. Get acquainted with querying by using basic mode, then switch to advanced mode to refine your charts using NRQL. Get started Before querying, you may want to read Introduction to querying and how to explore your data. To find the query builder, go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data. Use the query builder: basic and advanced modes The query builder has several modes: Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Advanced (PromQL-style) mode Tip You can also switch to the Data explorer tab at any time to browse your data and create charts visually, without performing queries. Basic mode Basic mode doesn't require a query language, and so it's useful if you aren't familiar with NRQL or SQL. It's also a quick way to answer one-off questions, such as how many cities outside of the United States are accessing the shopping site for your company. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Basic mode Use basic mode to guide you through the process to specify data for a chart. With basic mode you can: Choose your data source. In basic mode, you start by selecting an event and then picking the attribute that corresponds to the information to show in your chart. Specify (filter) the data for your chart. You can narrow the results and choose an attribute to facet by. Select the time range to present in the chart. You can select a time range from the menu or use the custom option to create your own time range. See Use basic mode for more information about this feature. Advanced (NRQL) mode With the advanced (NRQL) mode you can create your own queries using the NRQL query language. NRQL queries may be simple or complex, depending on what data you want to use and how to display it in your chart. This example of the advanced mode shows the NRQL query with the same data as used in basic mode. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Advanced (NRQL). Use advanced (NRQL) mode to write a query that specifies data for a chart. Tip With APM's real time streaming, you can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in dashboards. See Use advanced (NRQL) mode for more information about using this feature. Advanced (PromQL-style) mode With the advanced (PromQL-style) mode you can run basic PromQL-style queries. You can switch between basic and advanced modes while defining your query in order to: customize some of the values. learn how NRQL queries are structured using the data you specified in basic mode. Important If you build your query in basic mode and update it using advanced mode, you cannot return to basic mode to edit that query. You must make any additional changes in advanced (NRQL) mode. Once you specify the data you want, your chart is ready to view. Your query automatically runs in basic mode as you make changes to the inputs. If using advanced (NRQL or PromQL-style) mode, run your query. Use your charts Once you have built your chart you can: Change the type of chart. Based on the data you specified, the query builder selects the chart type that displays your results most effectively.

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: allows you to configure your Nerdlet and write to your Nerdlet's URL state.",

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] }, \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Alerts & AI. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Create a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Product-based pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The pricing edition (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher editions give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (learn more). The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The total number of provisioned full users (users with access to everything available at that edition). Basic users are free. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the Billing user role. For users on the original user model, this requires an Owner or Admin role. For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. You can also do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Other user-related billing details: You can see your full user count in the UI. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a subscription term and/or when a user is provisioned as full user or switched to a full user. A user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For organizations that have multiple accounts, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you may not see the complete user count for that organization. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition for Full Stack Observability, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise Full Stack Observability editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing.

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] }, \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure.

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Alerts & AI. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Create a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Product-based pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The pricing edition (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher editions give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (learn more). The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The total number of provisioned full users (users with access to everything available at that edition). Basic users are free. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the Billing user role. For users on the original user model, this requires an Owner or Admin role. For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. You can also do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Other user-related billing details: You can see your full user count in the UI. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a subscription term and/or when a user is provisioned as full user or switched to a full user. A user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For organizations that have multiple accounts, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you may not see the complete user count for that organization. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition for Full Stack Observability, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise Full Stack Observability editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special non-profit pricing, go to newrelic.org and apply. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] }, \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed.

      "body": "When you create a dashboard, you add a variety of charts to visualize your New Relic telemetry data. These charts, offered out-of-the-box, are customizable in that you can: Resize and arrange their positions in your dashboard Update their names, display options, and underlying data queries But sometimes the charts we include in the platform aren't enough for you to get the most from your data. When you want to visualize your data in a specific way that isn't possible with our charts, you can build a custom visualization. New Relic is programmable. This means that if the platform doesn't solve your specific problem, you can write and deploy your own code to fill in some of those gaps. One area where programmability is valuable is in visualizing your data. While New Relic offers all the telemetry data that your apps and services report and provides many different kinds of charts to present that data, you might need to create something entirely unique. With the New Relic One SDK, we've provided you all the tools you'll need to create your own visualizations. Build your custom visualization With the New Relic One SDK, you can create a Nerdpack, which houses your visualization code. This code consists of a React component, logic, data queries, and external dependencies. The SDK also provides a component library that you can use to make NerdGraph requests, access platform state context, and more. Your first visualization To build your first custom visualization, install the New Relic One SDK and make sure you have the latest version: bash Copy $ nr1 update Create a Nerdpack and a visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name custom-viz ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ...my-first-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-first-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization custom-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz/visualizations/custom-viz\" The visualization you created in the my-first-viz Nerdpack contains a default component to help you get started. Serve your visualization locally: bash Copy $ cd my-first-viz $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ custom-viz https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Important To view the locally served visualization, you must use the nerdpacks=local querystring. Enter values into the fields under Configure visualization properties and see how the chart changes: Resources Here is a list of resources for building custom visualizations: Build a custom visualization for dashboards (Guide) Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK (Guide) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Customize your visualization You have a lot of control over how your visualization operates. You can choose what properties of the visualization are customizable, such as colors, sizes, and how you present your legend. You can choose whether it presents New Relic data or data from an external source. You can even install and use third-party components to create a specific look: Resources Here is a list of resources for configuring custom visualizations: Configuration options (Documentation) Customize visualizations with configuration (Guide) Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (Video) Use your custom visualization During development, you can serve your visualization locally. Under Apps > Custom Visualizations, you can view and configure your visualization to see how your data looks, but you can't instantiate that chart and use it in your account: To do that, you need to publish it to the New Relic One catalog and subscribe to it from your account. Because custom visualizations are Nerdpack artifacts, you publish and subscribe to them the same way you publish and subscribe to New Relic One applications. Once you've done so, you can add your custom visualization to a dashboard: If you want to reuse your visualization to present different data or the same data in a new way, you can go back to Apps > Custom Visualizations, choose your visualization, configure another instance and add it to your dashboard: Resources Here is a list of resources for using custom visualizations: Add custom visualizations to your dashboards (Documentation) New Relic Dashboards and Custom Visualizations: Flexibility with Less Toil (Blog) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (Video)",

      "body": "Here are some limits, requirements, and recommendations when you create metrics from events, logs, or spans. Metric aggregation Your NRQL query must use one of the following summary, uniqueCount, or distribution functions to aggregate metrics: Function Comments summary Creates a summary metric data point for each time window (currently 1 minute). Use this if your NRQL query uses aggregator functions supported by the summary metric type, such as average, sum, min, or max. Example rule-creation query: SELECT summary(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host Copy uniqueCount Creates a uniqueCount metric data point for each 1-minute time window. Use this if your NRQL query uses the uniqueCount aggregator type. Example rule-creation query: FROM Transaction SELECT uniqueCount(request.headers.userAgent) AS 'server.request.header.userAgent.uniqueCount' WHERE appName = 'Browser Monitoring Router' FACET httpResponseCode, name, appName, host Copy distribution Creates a distribution metric data point for each 1-minute time window. Use this if your NRQL query uses aggregator functions such as percentile, histogram, min, max, average, sum, or count. Use only the attribute of interest as the argument, and discard the rest of the arguments from percentile or histogram. The generated metric supports any argument on percentile or histogram. Example of creating a distribution rule: SELECT distribution(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host Copy Simple count: summary(1) and sum If you want a metric that's a simple count of the events, logs, or spans that match a particular WHERE clause, use the summary(1) metric. This metric type counts the number of specified events, logs, or spans per minute. When querying the created metric, use the sum method to see the result. Example: If you want to create a metric named foo.count that counts the transactions named foo, the NRQL would look like this: FROM Transaction SELECT summary(1) AS 'foo.count' WHERE name = 'foo' Copy Then, you would query it like this: FROM Metric SELECT sum(foo.count) SINCE 30 minutes ago Copy For more information about metrics, see our documentation about metric types. Rule-creation limits These limits affect metric rules creation: Limits Comments Account limits An account can have a maximum of 1,000 metric-creation rules. Metric rule limits A rule can: Create a maximum of 10 metrics. Use only one type of data (events, logs, or spans). Select a maximum of 20 attributes (facets) to include on a metric. Time window limits 50K limit on unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations for a single metric in a 24-hour time window. If this limit is exceeded, the rule is disabled and an NrIntegrationError event is created in the account that includes: The rule details A message about having too many facets A newRelicFeature of eventToMetric Limits on metric name and attribute value combinations The limit on total unique metric name/attribute value combinations in a 24-hour time window for an account is: Equal to three times the purchased monthly average data points per minute Up to a maximum of 10M Cardinality limits Rule-creation limits include limits on the number of unique combinations of metric name and attribute values. This limit exists because a large number of attributes and/or attribute values can lead to an exponential increase in the size of data reported. Example metric creation rule that attaches five attributes: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName, entityName, processId Copy If each of the five attributes reported ten unique values within a one-minute time window, the number of unique metric-name/attribute combinations would theoretically have a maximum of 10x10x10x10x10, or 100,000. Multiple attributes with multiple unique values can lead to a large number of unique metric entries. In practice, this isn't usually the case, because attributes are often related. For example, if one attribute is hostname and another is awsRegion, when you see hostname A, it will always be in AWS region B; you'd never see hostname A and other AWS region values. This is why it's important, during the NRQL creation process, to use the uniqueCount function to verify how many unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations your NRQL query is generating. Multiple metrics from one rule A rule can create up to ten metrics. There are no functional differences between metrics created one at a time and those created with a single rule. Reasons for creating multiple metrics with a single rule: Less likely to reach rules-per-account limit. Easier to add the same attributes to multiple metrics. Example creating multiple metrics with a single rule: FROM Transaction SELECT uniqueCount(request.headers.userAgent) AS 'server.request.header.userAgent.uniqueCount', summary(duration) AS 'server.duration', summary(totalTime) AS 'server.totalTime' WHERE appName = 'Browser Monitoring Router' FACET httpResponseCode, name, appName, host Copy Metric naming A metric is given a name with the AS clause, as part of the NRQL rule-creation process. In the following NRQL example, the name of the metric is io.totalread.bytes: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy If there is no name assigned with the AS clause, the metric name is the name of the queried attribute. In this example, if no name was assigned, the metric name would be ioTotalReadBytes. Metric names Requirements and recommendations Requirements Requirements for naming a metric: Less than or equal to 255 (UTF-16) 16-bit code units. One way to ensure you are under the limit is to keep each string under 127 of whatever is easiest to count. No spaces. Start with a letter. Examples of strong metric names: rubyvm.memory.heap_used redis.container.cpu.percent memcached.process_virtual_memory.bytes Length and structure Decide on a name and structure that makes it easy for others to find, understand, and use this metric. We recommend keeping your metric name under 40 characters for ideal readability. Longer names can get cut off or overlap with other names. Your metric naming scheme will depend on your business logic. You may want to use namespaces to prefix your metric name, or your names may need to be more general. Components within the name If you want to create components within your metric name (like the source of metrics and the thing you’re measuring), we recommend going from broad to specific (left to right): Use a dot to separate those components in order to be consistent with our New Relic metric names. Then, use an underscore to separate words within the dots. Example: application.page_view.duration Copy Attributes Avoid putting attributes in your metric name. Attributes are qualities of your metric that you can use to filter or facet your data, like cluster or availability zone. Example: If you included availability zone in your metric name, it would mean, for that metric, you wouldn’t be able to see results across all availability zones. Changing metric names If you change a metric name, historical data will not be updated to that new name. To query or chart that historical data, you will need to specify the older metric name.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Tip Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] }, \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Alerts & AI. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Create a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Product-based pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The pricing edition (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher editions give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (learn more). The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The total number of provisioned full users (users with access to everything available at that edition). Basic users are free. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the Billing user role. For users on the original user model, this requires an Owner or Admin role. For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. You can also do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Other user-related billing details: You can see your full user count in the UI. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a subscription term and/or when a user is provisioned as full user or switched to a full user. A user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For organizations that have multiple accounts, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you may not see the complete user count for that organization. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition for Full Stack Observability, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise Full Stack Observability editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special non-profit pricing, go to newrelic.org and apply. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "To view workloads, go to one.newrelic.com and find them on the Explorer. There are two main tabs, Health and Activity, plus the header. The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload.

      "body": "Our workloads feature gives you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, providing aggregated health and activity data from frontend to backend services across your entire stack. Workloads help you understand the status of complex systems, detect issues, understand the cause and impact of an incident, and resolve those issues quickly. Tip To use workloads and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] }, \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Alerts & AI. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Create a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Product-based pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The pricing edition (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher editions give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (learn more). The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The total number of provisioned full users (users with access to everything available at that edition). Basic users are free. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the Billing user role. For users on the original user model, this requires an Owner or Admin role. For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. You can also do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Other user-related billing details: You can see your full user count in the UI. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a subscription term and/or when a user is provisioned as full user or switched to a full user. A user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For organizations that have multiple accounts, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you may not see the complete user count for that organization. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition for Full Stack Observability, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise Full Stack Observability editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special non-profit pricing, go to newrelic.org and apply. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] }, \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Alerts & AI. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Create a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Product-based pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The pricing edition (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher editions give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (learn more). The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The total number of provisioned full users (users with access to everything available at that edition). Basic users are free. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the Billing user role. For users on the original user model, this requires an Owner or Admin role. For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. You can also do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Other user-related billing details: You can see your full user count in the UI. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a subscription term and/or when a user is provisioned as full user or switched to a full user. A user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For organizations that have multiple accounts, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you may not see the complete user count for that organization. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition for Full Stack Observability, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise Full Stack Observability editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special non-profit pricing, go to newrelic.org and apply. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. Migrate users to the new account/user model In April of 2021, we began allowing some New Relic organizations to migrate their original user model users to the newer New Relic One user model. This new user model offers many benefits in simplifying and improving how you manage your users' roles and access to accounts. To learn how to find out if you qualify for this and how to start, see Migrate users. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Update user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. For more about this, see User type. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for these basic users. The preview period gave basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorer's Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can upgrade to become full users in the UI. They will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. They cannot self-upgrade; they must request an upgrade. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a master account that has sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a master account with sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. However, they will not receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for sub-accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on these sub-accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete sub-accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Insights, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads. Link dashboards to workloads and save filters. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute these functions, assign the workloads manager add-on role.",

      "body": "Our F5 BIG-IP integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your F5 BIG-IP instance to our platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. We collect data at the system, application, pool, pool member, virtual server, and node levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with F5 BIG-IP 11.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with the infrastructure agent. F5 BIG-IP user account with Access Auditor-level user privileges and iControl REST API access permissions. F5 BIG-IP users and privileges To create a new user and assign user permissions: Create a user account with, at minimum, Access Auditor-level permissions. For instructions, see the F5 official documentation. Once the user has been created, assign the user iControl REST user permissions. Tip Administrator-level permissions may be required to collect some system sample metrics or system inventory configuration data. For more information on user permission levels, see User role access descriptions. Tip For detailed information on iControl users and permission, download and review the iControl REST User Guide. Install and activate To install the F5 BIG-IP integration, choose your setup: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-f5. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp f5-config.yml.sample f5-config.yml Copy Edit the f5-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-f5 MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-f5/nri-f5-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-f5-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy f5-config.yml.sample f5-config.yml Copy Edit the f5-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: We recommend you install the integration on a separate server and monitor F5 remotely. Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For an example of the configuration file, see the example config file. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Commands The f5-config.yml file accepts the following commands: all_data: collects both inventory and metrics for the BIG-IP instance. inventory: collects only the inventory (configuration) data for the BIG-IP instance. metrics: collects only the metrics data for the BIG-IP instance. Arguments The f5-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: username: The username for the F5 BIG-IP connection. This field is required. password: The password for the F5 BIG-IP connection. This field is required. hostname: The hostname for the F5 BIG-IP connection. Default: f5-host. port: The port on which F5 BIG-IP instance is running. Default: 443. timeout: The number of seconds to wait before a request times out. Default: 30. ca_bundle_file: Alternative certificate authority bundle file. ca_bundle_dir: Alternative certificate authority bundle directory. partition_filter: An array of the partitions to collect from, in JSON. Default: '[\"Common\"]'.

      "body": "In order to use infrastructure integrations, you need to grant New Relic permission to read the relevant data from your account. Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses managed policies to grant these permissions. Recommended policy Important Recommendation: Grant an account-wide ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS. AWS automatically updates this policy when new services are added or existing services are modified. New Relic infrastructure integrations have been designed to function with ReadOnlyAccess policies. For instructions, see Connect AWS integrations to infrastructure. Exception: The Trusted Advisor integration is not covered by the ReadOnlyAccess policy. It requires the additional AWSSupportAccess managed policy. This is also the only integration that requires full access permissions (support:*) in order to correctly operate. We notified Amazon about this limitation. Once it's resolved we'll update documentation with more specific permissions required for this integration. Optional policy If you cannot use the ReadOnlyAccess managed policy from AWS, you can create your own customized policy based on the list of permissions. This allows you to specify the optimal permissions required to fetch data from AWS for each integration. While this option is available, it is not recommended because it must be manually updated when you add or modify your integrations. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom policy, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. There are two ways to set up your customized policy: You can either use our CloudFormation template, or create own yourself by adding the permissions you need. Option 1: Use our CloudFormation template Our CloudFormation template contains all the permissions for all our AWS integrations. A user different than root can be used in the managed policy.

Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per sub-account in a given 24-hour time period.

      "body": "New Relic's Metric API can be used to send metric data to New Relic from a variety of sources. This API is how metrics from some of our integrations and exporters get into New Relic. Tip To use APIs and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is the Metric API? The Metric API is a way to get metric data into New Relic. The API works by sending a POST request to our HTTP endpoint with a JSON payload containing the metric data. The Metric API is how metrics are ingested from some of our integrations, including our open source exporters (like DropWizard, OpenCensus, and Prometheus). The Metric API is also used by our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that make it easier to use our data-ingest APIs. The Metric API can be used to: Report metric data to New Relic without a New Relic agent. Integrate metric data from an open source or in-house developed tool, library, or framework. Fully control the metric data you're sending, including the resolution and associated dimensions. Leverage the power of NRQL, New Relic's query language, for querying your metric data. Set up alerts for your metric data. Requirements Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name metric-api.newrelic.com or metric-api.eu.newrelic.com. Get started If we don't have an existing integration that meets your metric-reporting needs, you have two options: Use our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that help you send us metrics and other data. Use the Metric API directly. Access and requirements You'll need a New Relic Insert API key. For information on limits and restricted attributes, see Metric API requirements and limits. Find and use your data You can find data sent via the Metric API (including from integrations that use this API) in these locations: From one.newrelic.com, select Explorer and look for your service. By querying the Metric data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Metric Copy For more on querying, see Metric query examples. For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Troubleshooting If you receive an NrIntegrationError, see Troubleshoot a NrIntegrationError event.",

      "body": "APM reports metric data in the form of metric timeslice data, and you can use NRQL to query, facet, and alert on this type of data. To explore timeslice data in the data explorer, see Explore your metrics. Why query metric timeslice data? We report metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data we call metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, Mobile, and Browser (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Historically, this type of data couldn't be queried via our query language, NRQL. But now we are converting popular APM metrics from metric timeslice data to more-detailed dimensional metric data, which opens them up for querying via NRQL and via our NerdGraph API. This capability allows you to create powerful, in-depth custom visualizations of these important APM metrics. And this includes being able to query your custom metrics. Important You cannot query timeslice metrics in conjunction with dimensional metrics or event data. Any query involving newrelic.timeslice.value or an apm.* metric can only return APM metrics. Where to query? We recommend querying APM metric timeslice data using New Relic One query builder in advanced mode. This experience offers full NRQL functionality, and also gives helpful auto-complete suggestions and feedback on query errors. You can also: Make NRQL queries using our NerdGraph (GraphQL) API Alert on NRQL queries using NRQL alert conditions How to construct a query In APM, some charts have the option to view the NRQL query that generated that chart. This can be a good option for understanding how to query metrics. The NRQL query examined below is slightly modified from the error rate chart on the APM summary page. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE (entity.guid = 'AN_ENTITY_GUID') AND (transactionType = 'Web') SINCE 1 day ago TIMESERIES Copy Here is a breakdown of how the parts of this query work: Query segment What does it do? FROM Metric Metric is one of our core data types, and metric timeslice data is stored as this data type. For general tips on querying Metric data, see Metric query examples. SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) This math generates a count of errors out of a total count of transaction metrics. This query uses the converted metric names. Note that you can use other aggregator functions. WHERE (entity.guid = 'AN_ENTITY_GUID') You must specify at least one data source. You can select a single entity's GUID, as shown here, or you can select multiple sources. This query uses entity.guid, but you can also use appId or appName. AND (transactionType = 'Web') Sets the transaction type to web, meaning that background/non-web transactions won't be counted. SINCE 1 day ago Selecting a time range. TIMESERIES This optional clause displays the results in a time-based chart. For general information on NRQL syntax, including FROM, FACET, and TIMESERIES, see Intro to NRQL. For more queries, see Query examples. How metric timeslice data is converted The conversion of original APM metric timeslice metrics into dimensional metrics that are available for querying is an ongoing process and isn't complete. If you don't see a metric you're looking for in this section, see Generic queries. Here are how the original APM metric timeslice metrics are converted into dimensional metrics: Metric timeslice structure Dimensional metric structure APM metric names are represented as single strings of segments separated by forward slashes. For example, the “Datastore/statement/MySQL/users/select” metric represents the time spent in a select database operation on the users table. A single dimensional metric named apm.service.datastore.operation.duration represents the entire group of datastore metrics. This metric has three attributes representing the data values encoded into the metric name, datastoreType, table and operation: datastoreType = ‘MySQL’ table = ‘users’ operation = ‘select’ Some of the APM metrics made available as dimensional metrics: Metric name Description Attributes apm.service.cpu.usertime.utilization Time spent in user-mode code percentage apm.service.datastore.operation.duration Response time for database calls broken out by table operations datastoreType, table, operation apm.service.error.count Summary error count metrics transactionType apm.service.external.host.duration Response time for external calls broken out by external host name external.host apm.service.instance.count Count of the number of agent instances apm.service.memory.physical Process memory in MB apm.service.transaction.apdex Apdex scores per transaction transactionName, transactionType apm.service.transaction.duration Response time per transaction keyTransactionName, transactionName, transactionType apm.service.transaction.error.count Error counts per transaction keyTransactionName, transactionName, transactionType apm.service.transaction.external.duration External call response time by transaction type transactionType Learn how to see all metrics available to you. To understand more about the general structure of metric timeslice data, including some common examples, see Metric timeslice data. Attributes These attributes are available in addition to the metric-specific attributes listed in the APM metrics table above. Name Description appName The name of the application. appId The ID of the application. entity.guid The GUID of the application. host The host of the monitored process. host.bootId The ID of the boot of the host, if available. host.displayName The display_name of the host, if it was set in the agent. instanceName For Java APM agents, host : port metricName The name of the dimensional metric. metricTimesliceName The timeslice name of the legacy metric. scope (Optional) The timeslice name of the legacy metric that this metric is \"scoped\" to. Metrics with a scope belong to it--their measurements apply to the context of the metric named in the scope attribute. See below for examples. Generic queries with the newrelic.timeslice.value metric For metrics that haven't been converted to dimensional metrics, or for your own custom metrics, we have a dimensional metric named newrelic.timeslice.value. Important We recommend using the dimensional metrics from the table above when possible. When to use newrelic.timeslice.value? Given a metric timeslice name, you can query to see if it has a converted dimensional metric equivalent with this syntax: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE metricTimesliceName = 'Datastore/statement/MySQL/test/select' Copy If the only metric name returned is newrelic.timeslice.value, you'll need to query your data using this general approach. Get available metrics To get a list of available metrics for an application, you can use a query like: SELECT uniques(metricTimesliceName) FROM Metric WHERE appName='YOUR_APP_NAME' AND newrelic.timeslice.value IS NOT NULL Copy Facet on a wildcarded metric name segment Some metric timeslice names include attribute values as segments of the metric name. For example, our APM agents report metrics by tracking the duration of external calls using this format: External/{externalHost}/all Copy Here, {externalHost} represents the host name for the outbound network call. Here's an example of a generic newrelic.timeslice.value query of a custom metric that facets on a wildcarded metric segment: FROM Metric SELECT count(newrelic.timeslice.value) WHERE appName = 'MY APP' WITH METRIC_FORMAT 'Custom/Labels/{action}' TIMESERIES FACET action Copy In this query, {action} creates a temporary attribute, action, which is then used by FACET action. You can use any name you want, because it's only an attribute that exists for the duration of the query. You should choose a name that does not conflict with an existing attribute name. Here's another example of a faceted wildcard query: This shows a NRQL query of metric timeslice data that facets the rate of Flask functions by the wildcarded process name. Recommended aggregator functions Recommended NRQL aggregator functions include: apdex average sum count rate uniques Query examples Some examples of querying metric timeslice data: Facet by multiple app names This query uses WHERE… IN to specify two applications and then facet by them: FROM Metric SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'Web throughput' WHERE appName IN ('MY_APPLICATION', 'MY_OTHER_APPLICATION') AND (transactionType = 'Web') FACET appName TIMESERIES Copy Throughput-per-minute rate This query displays requests-per-minute chart using the rate function: FROM Metric SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'HttpDispatcher requests_per_minute' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND (transactionType = 'Web') TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago Copy Facet by host-related attributes This query displays a requests-per-minute chart faceted by host name: FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.transaction.duration) as 'HttpDispatcher requests_per_minute' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND (transactionType = 'Web') TIMESERIES SINCE 3 hours ago FACET host LIMIT 20 Copy Instead of using host, you can facet by other host-related attributes, like host.bootId. Query of average duration of a metric This queries the average duration for a metric using average: FROM Metric SELECT average(apm.service.transaction.duration) as 'HttpDispatcher average duration' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND (transactionType = 'Web') TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago Copy Break down average time spent in a transaction by its component segments This query breaks down the average duration of single transaction (in this case, the show action in the UsersController of a Rails app named MY_APPLICATION) by the top 20 individual segments (database queries, external service calls, garbage collection time, etc.). It reproduces much of the \"Application breakdown\" chart as seen on the Transactions page In New Relic One for a service entity: FROM Metric SELECT average(newrelic.timeslice.value, exclusiveTime: true) as 'duration, seconds' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND scope = 'Controller/users/show' LIMIT 20 FACET metricTimesliceName TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago Copy",

      "body": "Sliding windows are a technique for generating charts using the SLIDE BY clause in conjunction with the TIMESERIES clause. With sliding windows, data is gathered in time \"windows\" that overlap with each other. For example, in the image below, a query gathers data with 5 minute windows. The windows \"slide\" by 1 minute. Each window overlaps with the previous window by 4 minutes. 5-minute windows with 1-minute \"slide\" In contrast, with \"tumbling\" or \"cascading\" windows, the windows do not overlap. For example, in this TIMESERIES 3 minutes NRQL query, the windows are 3 minutes in length, with each beginning when the other ends. There is no overlap in the measurement interval. 3-minute windows with no overlap or \"slide\". When to use sliding windows Sliding windows are helpful when you need to smooth out \"spiky\" charts. One common use case is to use sliding windows to smooth line graphs that have a lot of variation over short periods of time in cases where the rolling aggregate (for example a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. In the example below, data varies greatly from one minute to another, so the 1-minute tumbling window chart shows many high peaks and low valleys. TIMESERIES query without SLIDE BY clause However, in this example, 5-minute wide TIMESERIES windows are smoothed with the help of 1-minute SLIDE BY intervals. The query returns similar data but creates a much smoother chart. TIMESERIES query with SLIDE BY clause Valid NRQL syntax for SLIDE BY Valid NRQL syntax for the SLIDE BY clause will follow the format below. SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer1 units SLIDE BY integer2 units Copy integer1 specifies the sliding window width and integer2 specifies the SLIDE BY interval. units is a time unit, such as second, minute, hour, or day. All standard NRQL time units are accepted. Here’s a real-life example. It shows 5-minute TIMESERIES windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval. SELECT average(duration) from Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy Translation from PromQL-style queries When applicable, a PromQL-style query is translated into a NRQL sliding window query. For example, if your PromQL style query uses rate(request_count[5m]) for the past 60 minutes with a 1-minute window overlap, the NRQL translation would be the query below. SELECT rate(sum(request_count), 1 SECONDS) FROM Metric SINCE 3600 SECONDS AGO UNTIL NOW FACET dimensions() LIMIT 100 TIMESERIES 300000 SLIDE BY 60000 Copy In the translation output, the default unit of millisecond is used for TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY clauses. For TIMESERIES, 300000 ms is 300 seconds, or 5 minutes, specifying a window size of 5 minutes. For SLIDE BY, 60000 ms is 60 seconds, specifying a slide interval of 1 minute. Use SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO You can combine SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO arguments to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy Tip When paired with SLIDE BY, TIMESERIES does not support AUTO or MAX. The TIMESERIES value must be an integer time unit value. In other words, SLIDE BY AUTO or SLIDE BY MAX will work, but TIMESERIES AUTO or TIMESERIES MAX followed by SLIDE BY and MAX, AUTO, or a specific integer time unit is not supported. Tip The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which will show up as gaps and unexpected results. If you experience these issues with query results, consider checking for instances of SLIDE BY where the step interval exceeds the window size.",

If the number is in the common block, then the entire block will be dropped. If the number is in a metric data point, then the metric data point it resides in will be dropped. Payload size Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. Payload format The payload must encoded as UTF-8. Attribute naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). The following default limits apply only to data collected via the Prometheus Remote Write integration: Condition Limit Max unique Count and Summary timeseries (cardinality) per account per 5 minute interval See Additional account conditions. 1 million A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes. Timeseries received above this limit are dropped. This limit is enforced prior to and in addition to standard Metric limits. Additional account conditions Metric API limits apply at the individual account level. Trial and paid accounts receive a 1M DPM and 1M cardinality limit for trial purposes, but you can request up to 15M DPM and 15M cardinality for your account. To request changes to your metric rate limits, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Rate limit violations This section describes how the Metric API behaves when you exceed the rate limits, and how to respond if limits are exceeded. Max data points per minute (DPM) Data points per minute refers to the per minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the Metric API. When the maximum DPM limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Metric API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Max unique timeseries per account per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-account, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max unique timeseries per metric name per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-metric name, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max payloads per minute If you make more than 100k POST requests to the Metric API endpoint within a minute, the endpoint will return a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. In general, if you reach this limit, consider creating larger payloads. To do this, combine more data points into each request to reduce the number of POSTs that are necessary. If this is not an option, you can request a rate limit increase by contacting your New Relic account representative or visiting our Support portal. Restricted attributes These attributes are restricted by the New Relic platform. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point will cause the data point to be dropped, or the value to be omitted or overwritten: Attribute Description newrelic.source This resets to the value metricAPI. metricName This resets to the name value passed into each data point. This allows name to be an attribute key. endTimestamp timestamp and interval.ms will be converted to an endTimestamp for the data point. Additional restrictions include: Restriction Comments Metric and attribute names You cannot pass the same value for metric name and attribute name. In the following example, the metric is invalid because the metric is named service.errors.all and there is an attribute service.errors.all. Example: Metric value used as an attribute (invalid) [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\" , \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"service.errors.all\" : \"test\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Reserved words The Metric API inherits some reserved words from New Relic Insights, including accountID, appId, and eventType. Additionally, the syntax terms for NRQL are restricted unless you backtick (``) them. For a full list, see Reserved words: NRQL syntax terms. Keys within metric JSON All keys used within the metric JSON cannot be attribute keys. This includes interval.ms, timestamp, value, common, min, max, count, sum, and metrics. Exception: You can use name as an attribute key.",

      "body": "Every time you deploy an application, you hope that it's efficient and error-free. The reality, however, is usually quite different. You might introduce a bug in a release, overlook an edge case, or rely on a broken dependency. These issues, and others, can result in bad user experiences. In this guide, you: Use the open-source New Relic demo-deployer to spin up the infrastructure for Acme Telco Lite, a fictional company. This demo scenario is part of our Demo Catalog and will simulate real-world issues in a controlled, demo environment Use New Relic to understand those issues from the perspective of a Telco Lite developer Use the deployer to tear down the resources you create Welcome to Acme Telco Lite! Acme Telco Lite is a mock telecom business that maintains an eCommerce website for its customers. The site's architecture has eight, interconnected microservices, plus a simulator: The simulator isn't part of the Telco Lite infrastructure, but it is part of the demo deployment. It runs scenarios against the application to create web traffic and generate interesting data in New Relic. Set up your environment Before you begin, follow the Prerequisites guide from the deployer's GitHub repository for a detailed walkthrough of how to set up your environment. For this guide, you can choose between Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host your deployment. The guide steps you through: Installing Docker & pulling the demo-deployer image locally Creating a user config file containing credentials for New Relic and your cloud provider Downloading a .pem key file (if your cloud provider is AWS) Once you're all set up, deploy Acme Telco Lite. Deploy Telco Lite It's time to deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services using demo-deployer. Copy the url for the demo that corresponds to the cloud provider you chose when you set up your environment: AWS Telco Lite Demo Azure Telco Lite Demo GCP Telco Lite Demo Follow the Deployment guide in the Demo Catalog repository for a thorough explanation of how to use the deployer in a local Docker environment. When you run the deployment script, make sure to pass the url you copied for <demo-url>. Tip Since Telco Lite contains several services, the deployment can take over half an hour. When the deloyer is finished, you should see some output stating that the deployment was successful: bash Copy [INFO] Executing Deployment [✔] Parsing and validating Deployment configuration success [✔] Provisioner success [✔] Installing On-Host instrumentation success [✔] Installing Services and instrumentations success [INFO] Deployment successful!

View your services With your services running in the cloud, log in to New Relic and select APM from the top navigation to see how your services are holding up: Yikes! The alerts, high response times, and red-colored indicators suggest things aren't well. Use New Relic to diagnose these issues, which are simultaneously affecting your services: Issue 1: The Warehouse Portal has abnormally high response times Issue 2: Multiple services are raising error alerts Tip Don't worry if you don't see all the same alerts. The simulator triggers issues at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. Tear down Telco Lite When you're finished diagnosing all the issues effecting Telco Lite, follow the Teardown guide in the deployer's repository to tear down the services you created in your cloud provider. If you're still exploring, don't tear down your services, or you'll have to deploy them again later. Conclusion Congratulations, you're done! Throughout this tutorial, you: Used the demo-deployer to deploy Telco Lite to the cloud Used New Relic to investigate simulated issues in Telco Lite services Tore down all the infrastructural resources you created throughout this tutorial Hopefully, you learned a lot about using New Relic to investigate issues in your services. To get your hands on more features of New Relic, pick another demo from the catalog and spin it up with the deployer!",

      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why Telco-Warehouse Portal has slower-than-normal response times. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the high response times in your services. Step 1 of 6 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that the response time for Telco-Warehouse Portal is 43 seconds, much higher than the response times in other services: On the APM page, select the Telco-Warehouse Portal service name to see a summary of that service. The top graph in the summary view shows Web transactions time: You see several peaks, reaching almost 50,000 milliseconds—or 50 seconds! From this graph, you can actually gain a little more insight by toggling the colored components beneath the graph. For example, select Node.js: The graph changes to show only what the Node.js component contributes to the overall response time—less than 100 ms, in this example. Now, select Web external and deselect Node.js: External web traffic is the primary contributor to the high response times. That's a good start, but it doesn't tell the whole story. Next, dive deeper to find out which external service is causing the issue. Step 2 of 6 So, you know that Web external is the culprit of the high response times, but it's hard to tell why. External web traffic is all the requests made from your service to other services. This means you should look into what external requests that the warehouse portal makes to try to understand exactly what external service is the bottleneck. From the left-hand navigation, select Monitor > Distributed tracing: This view shows you requests to the warehouse portal. Select a request from the table at the bottom of the view to see a trace through that request: This trace shows that one external request contributes almost all of the total trace duration. Specifically, an external request to the Telco-Fulfillment Service contributes over 99% of the overall response time. This is good news! You own the fulfillment service, which means you can drill down for even more information. Select the offending row (called a span), and then select Explore this transaction: Step 3 of 6 You're now looking at the __main__:inventory_item transaction overview. Because you know that some part of this transaction is slow, you can use this overview to narrow your focus even further. Similar to how you modified the warehouse portal APM graph, you can look specifically at the components of this transaction to understand where the root cause of the slowness is. Another way to view this information is to scroll down to the Breakdown table in that same view: Function/__main__:inventory_item, a Python function, contributes over 99% of the overall response time. At this point, you know that Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow. You also know that the issue in the fulfillment service is local because over 99% of the request is spent in Python code, not external services. Navigate to the fulfillment service's summary page to look at the service as a whole, instead of this single transaction: Step 4 of 6 Scroll down on this view to familiarize yourself with the graphs it shows, such as Throughput and Error rate. At the bottom of the page, you can see a table with the fulfillment hosts. You can't currently drill into a specific host in the new UI (we're working on it), but you can in the old UI. Toggle Show new view to off and select the host link: Step 5 of 6 Now, you're looking at graphs in the infrastructure view for that service's host. Notice that CPU % has a lot of high spikes. Click and drag on the graph from the start of a spike to the end of it to narrow the timeslice to the period when CPU utilization goes up: If you compare this graph to the fulfillment service's transaction graph you looked at earlier, you'll see that soon after __main__:inventory_item begins executing, the CPU utilization of the host sharply rises to 100%! Step 6 of 6 Now, you understand the problem causing slow response times in the warehouse portal, but you don't know the extent of the issue. Using service maps, you can see all your services that depend on the fullfillment service. Navigate to the service map under APM > Telco-Fulfillment Service: This map shows you the fulfillment service's incoming and outgoing dependencies. Not only is Telco-Warehouse Portal dependent on the fullfillment service, but so is Telco-Web Portal! Select the web portal node to see that the fulfillment service also affects the web portal's response times: Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow The fulfillment service's Python function contributes over 99% of the response time Soon after the Python function starts executing, the host's CPU utilization spikes up to 100% The fulfillment service also affects Telco-Web Portal response times Now, as the developer behind the fulfillment service, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the CPU spikes. Congratulations! You can learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, you can tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From data explorer you can access query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

Important Are you a New Relic Insights user? See our transition guide. Why it matters Modern business systems are a complex maze of data-generating elements. You need an easy, solid way to fetch, analyze, and visualize the never-ending stream of data flowing from your daily working activities. Use the query builder to: Quickly access your data and build customized charts to learn and understand the health of your infrastructure, applications, and other services. Add charts to your dashboards to obtain a complete real-time view of the state of your system. Share your charts with colleagues or users in just two clicks. Get acquainted with querying by using basic mode, then switch to advanced mode to refine your charts using NRQL. Get started Before querying, you may want to read Introduction to querying and how to explore your data. To find the query builder, go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data. Use the query builder: basic and advanced modes The query builder has several modes: Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Advanced (PromQL-style) mode Tip You can also switch to the Data explorer tab at any time to browse your data and create charts visually, without performing queries. Basic mode Basic mode doesn't require a query language, and so it's useful if you aren't familiar with NRQL or SQL. It's also a quick way to answer one-off questions, such as how many cities outside of the United States are accessing the shopping site for your company. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Basic mode Use basic mode to guide you through the process to specify data for a chart. With basic mode you can: Choose your data source. In basic mode, you start by selecting an event and then picking the attribute that corresponds to the information to show in your chart. Specify (filter) the data for your chart. You can narrow the results and choose an attribute to facet by. Select the time range to present in the chart. You can select a time range from the menu or use the custom option to create your own time range. See Use basic mode for more information about this feature. Advanced (NRQL) mode With the advanced (NRQL) mode you can create your own queries using the NRQL query language. NRQL queries may be simple or complex, depending on what data you want to use and how to display it in your chart. This example of the advanced mode shows the NRQL query with the same data as used in basic mode. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Advanced (NRQL). Use advanced (NRQL) mode to write a query that specifies data for a chart. Tip With APM's real time streaming, you can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in dashboards. See Use advanced (NRQL) mode for more information about using this feature. Advanced (PromQL-style) mode With the advanced (PromQL-style) mode you can run basic PromQL-style queries. You can switch between basic and advanced modes while defining your query in order to: customize some of the values. learn how NRQL queries are structured using the data you specified in basic mode. Important If you build your query in basic mode and update it using advanced mode, you cannot return to basic mode to edit that query. You must make any additional changes in advanced (NRQL) mode. Once you specify the data you want, your chart is ready to view. Your query automatically runs in basic mode as you make changes to the inputs. If using advanced (NRQL or PromQL-style) mode, run your query. Use your charts Once you have built your chart you can: Change the type of chart. Based on the data you specified, the query builder selects the chart type that displays your results most effectively. However, you can choose from other available chart types to present your data in the visual format that you want to use. Share your chart. Add your chart to a dashboard.",

Change the appearance of your chart When you run your query in advanced (NRQL) mode or view your chart while using basic mode to specify data, the query builder analyzes your data and applies a chart type that fits your data. For some queries, you'll have several options of chart types to choose from. To change chart type, use the Chart type menu to the right of the current chart. Each type in the list has a tooltip with information about using that type. Example of the chart type menu, showing a tooltip. Customize your charts While we try our best to optimize how we display your data, sometimes you may have other needs. To this end, you can customize charts to display information at your convenience. Tip Customizations are available depending on the chart type. Format date and time Tip For table and billboard charts. Customize the date and time format for tables and billboards: for each type of data, you can select if you want to leave it as it is, or modify the format as Numeric or Date. If data is a timestamp, you can choose how to represent the date and time: For numbers, select if you want us to auto-format them, or chose the number of decimals you want to see. Customize the Y axis Tip For line and area charts. On line charts and area charts you can adjust the Y axis to display the data within certain values by setting a minimum and maximum value for the axis. If no customization option is selected, dashboards automatically displays the full Y axis from 0 to the top value plus a margin. Enable or disable the legend Tip For line and area charts, and histograms. For line charts, area charts, and histograms, you can disable or enable the legend. Remove the other groups facet Tip For bar and pie charts, and tables. When faceting on bar charts, pie charts, or tables, and if the number of faceting on queries is larger than 2,000, the Other groups facet aggregates the rest of facets. With this customization you can select whether to see Other groups, or remove it. More chart-specific features For more chart type-specific features, see Chart types.

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

In addition to instrumenting your web frameworks, you can also instrument calls to and from messaging systems, database calls, and external calls! By passing context about your code to the APIs, you will get the same reporting, including cross application tracing, that you get with New Relic’s built-in instrumentation. Solr This release adds support for Solr versions 5 and 6 (up to and including version 6.3.0). Fixes Fixes a bug that prevents an application from starting up when a JAX-RS annotated method contains more than 8 parameters. Fixes an issue that affected Spring and JAX-RS applications compiled with the Java 8 flag javac -parameters. The issue would cause the application to throw a java.lang.reflect.MalformedParametersException exception. Fixes bug that affected applications implementing JAX-RS endpoints using static methods. The agent now reports WildFly dispatcher name and version. Fixes a bug in which Queue Time could be misreported on the Overview page for customers injecting the X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start HTTP headers. This fix brings the Java Agent into compliance with the behavior of other New Relic Agents.

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the first call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Additional API usage examples For detailed code examples about using the APIs, see New Relic's documentation about custom instrumentation for: External calls, cross application traces, messaging, datastores, and web frameworks Cross application tracing and external datastore calls Apps using custom instrumentation with annotation Custom framework instrumentation API Preventing unwanted instrumentation Inserting custom attributes Inserting custom events Collecting custom metrics",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize NRQL data, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { this[index] = { endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, } }, data ) historicalData.data = data return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data, format it according to the TableChart specifications, and set it on historicalData.data. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet.",

      "body": "You can generate metric-type data from other types of data in New Relic, including events, logs, and spans. Metrics are aggregates of your data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods. This document explains: Reasons to use this feature Available operations How to use our NerdGraph API tool to perform operations Why create metrics from other data types? Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage. This in turn allows you to query your data and build charts more easily. The difference between metrics and other types of data in New Relic is based on time. For more information, see Understand data types. Events, logs, spans: These types of data represent a single record at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your events, logs, or spans. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you can aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this information month over month. Why use metrics? Comments Flexibility Metrics are dimensional. You can choose what metadata (like host name or app name) is attached to them. Common metric measurements, like average, sum, minimum, and maximum, are already calculated. Data aggregation and retention The data has already been pre-aggregated into longer-period time buckets. Data retention is 13 months. Query capabilities You can query using the Metric data type. When you create metrics, this does not delete your events or other types of data. However, metrics are better for longer-range querying and charting. To get started converting your data to metrics, create a rule. Available operations To show, create, and delete rules for generating metrics from events, logs, or spans, use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. These operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing metrics rules). All operations are role-based in NerdGraph as the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics include: Create a rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule The method being called to delete a rule. deletes This takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Example response for the request: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsDeleteRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"id\": \"12\", \"name\": \"Test Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } Copy Enable or disable a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To enable or disable an existing rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics, use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation. The only difference is whether enabled is set to true or false. Example request to enable an existing metrics rule: mutation { eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsUpdateRule The method being called to update an existing rule and either enable it or disable it. updates This takes three required parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. enabled: To enable a disabled rule, set this to true. To disable a rule, set this to false. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Queries Query operations include: List all rules for a New Relic account You can list all rules in a New Relic account or return a specific rule. Example listing all rules for account 123456: query { actor { account(id:123456) { eventsToMetrics{ allRules{ rules{ id name enabled nrql description } } } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description query One of the basic API operation types. Used to query but not make changes. actor This specifies the current New Relic user. account(id: 123456) Specify the ID for the New Relic account where to retrieve data. eventsToMetrics Scope the data only for events-to-metrics, logs-to-metrics, or spans-to-metrics rules. allRules Returns all rules for that account. rules In the rules block, you can define what data you want returned. Available fields include: id name description nrql accountId enabled Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"allRules\": { \"rules\": [ { \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" }, { \"description\": \"Metric for duration\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"Duration Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy List rule by rule ID If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now you want to list its contents so you can review it. Example listing rule 36 for New Relic account 123456: query { actor { account(id: 123456) { eventsToMetrics { rulesById(ruleIds: \"36\") { rules { id name enabled nrql description accountId } } } } } } Copy For more details about the elements in this query, see List all rules. Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"rulesById\": { \"rules\": [ { \"accountId\": 123456, \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"36\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool You can use our GraphiQL tool to explore the data structure. You can also use it to build and run the operations to convert events, logs, and spans to metrics. To use this tool: Create the metrics operation's request with the required parameters. Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql, and paste your query into the box. To execute the operation, press Play. Or, to get the cURL format, select Copy as cURL.) Validate the response in the response box. Optional: To verify that your rule-creation operation was performed successfully, run a list query for that rule ID.",

      "body": "This doc contains tutorials on how to use NerdGraph to programmatically manage some New Relic API keys. For general information about New Relic keys, see API keys. Overview of feature description You can use the API keys UI to create and manage keys. Alternatively, you can use NerdGraph's ApiAccess field to programmatically create and manage the following types of keys: User keys License keys, including: General license key (used for APM, infrastructure monitoring, more) Browser key (for browser monitoring) One common use case for this feature is the ability to create and manage license keys to let you rotate keys for security purposes. Note that you can't use this NerdGraph functionality to manage or delete your original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage the ones you've created. Notes about this functionality: All mutations can accept multiple keys as arguments, and will return details about successful changes and errors. See examples below for details. All mutations (create, update and delete) will result in an NrAuditEvent that can be queried for auditing purposes. For details, see Audit events. Regarding license keys: License keys are categorized by NerdGraph as ingest keys. This is because their main use is to allow data ingest. You can create up to 1,000 keys of each license key type, which allows for key rotation. You can't manage or delete original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage keys you've created. Before using examples Things to note before using these example queries: The examples below use license keys (aka ingest keys), but you can query user keys in similar ways, replacing the ingest-key-specific fields with user-key-specific fields. To understand the data structure, we recommend experimenting with queries using the GraphiQL explorer. You can also create, view, and delete user keys using the UI. Create keys You can create multiple keys in a single mutation, for multiple accounts and key types. Note that the mutation can return successfully created keys as well as any errors encountered trying to create keys. Example of creating a key: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {ingest: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ingestType: BROWSER, name: \"Browser Key\", notes: \"A note.\"}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Here's an example of using this query to create a user key: Create a user key To create a user key, you'd change the above query slightly, in the keys section: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {user: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, userId: YOUR_USER_ID}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Copy Update keys The update mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. mutation { apiAccessUpdateKeys(keys: {ingest: {keyId: KEY_ID, name: \"Updated name\", notes: \"A new note!\"}}) { updatedKeys { id key type name notes } errors { message } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Delete keys The delete mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. Deleted keys will no longer grant access to New Relic systems and will no longer be returned by queries to the API access GraphQL API. mutation { apiAccessDeleteKeys(keys: {ingestKeyIds: INGEST_KEY_ID}) { deletedKeys { id } errors { message } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Query keys You can access ingest and user keys by querying a single key or all keys, scoped to the actor. If querying for a single key, you must provide the key ID and type (INGEST or USER). Querying for multiple keys is done via a key search, which uses a mandatory types list and an optional scope to filter results. User keys belonging to other users will be obfuscated in the results. Single key example query: query { actor { apiAccess { key(id: INGEST_KEY_ID, keyType: INGEST) { key name type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } Copy Key search example query: query { actor { apiAccess { keySearch(query: {types: INGEST, scope: {ingestTypes: BROWSER}}) { keys { name key type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data.

      "body": "This tutorial will explain how to use our NerdGraph API to set up your topology. Topology configuration allows your Applied Intelligence decisions to better correlate incidents. Requirements Topology correlation is currently in limited release. See topology requirements. To use NerdGraph, you'll need a user key. Overview of tutorial With New Relic’s Applied Intelligence, you can create custom decisions that govern how your incidents are correlated. One kind of custom decision logic uses the concept of \"topology,\" which is a representation of your service map: how the services and resources in your infrastructure relate to one another. This tutorial will show you how to use NerdGraph to: Set up your topology by creating vertices and edges Delete vertices and edges Retrieve topology data Before using NerdGraph to configure your topology, you should have a basic understanding of: What Applied Intelligence decisions are and how topology correlation works. The topology structure you're trying to implement. One way to understand this is to use our service map feature to see how entities in your infrastructure relate to each other. What NerdGraph is and how to use the NerdGraph API explorer to run queries. Mutation examples In NerdGraph, mutations are requests that perform an action (learn more about NerdGraph terminology), such as creating a resource or changing a configuration. In this section, we’ll show you how to use aiTopologyCollector mutations to create, edit, or delete your topology. In the create sections, we’ll create vertices and edges to represent this service map: This tutorial uses NerdGraph to create vertices and edges that represent these entities and their relationships. Create vertices The following mutation creates one or more vertices, which represent your monitored entities, and are the source from which your incidents come from. The NerdGraph call below uses the following fields: accountId: Your New Relic account ID. name: The name of the vertex. This value is case sensitive and must be unique within the graph. vertexClass: The vertex class can be application, host, cloud service, cluster, or datastore. This classification allows your decision logic to restrict your topology-based correlation to restrict vertices matching these classifications. definingAttributes: A set of attributes (key/value pairs) that match an incident event's attributes. These are usually unique identifiers that appear on all incidents, such as entity GUIDs or other IDs. If an incident contains any of the key/value pairs of a vertex’s definingAttributes, it’s matched to that vertex. To learn more about attributes and how they can be added, see Add attributes. Example call: mutation { aiTopologyCollectorCreateVertices( accountId: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID, vertices: [ {name: \"ServiceA\", vertexClass: APPLICATION, definingAttributes: [{key: \"application/name\", value: \"ServiceA\"}]}, {name: \"ServiceB\", vertexClass: APPLICATION, definingAttributes: [{key: \"application/name\", value: \"ServiceB\"}]}, {name: \"ServiceC\", vertexClass: APPLICATION, definingAttributes: [{key: \"application/name\", value: \"ServiceC\"}]}, {name: \"HOST1\", vertexClass: HOST, definingAttributes: [{key: \"host/name\", value: \"HOST1\"}, {key: \"availability-zone\", value: \"us-west-2a\"}, {key: \"region\", value: \"us-west-2\"}]}, {name: \"HOST2\", vertexClass: HOST, definingAttributes: [{key: \"host/name\", value: \"HOST2\"}, {key: \"availability-zone\", value: \"us-west-2b\"}, {key: \"region\", value: \"us-west-2\"}]}, {name: \"HOST3\", vertexClass: HOST, definingAttributes: [{key: \"host/name\", value: \"HOST3\"}, {key: \"availability-zone\", value: \"us-west-2c\"}, {key: \"region\", value: \"us-west-2\"}]}]) { result } } Copy Create edges This mutation is used to create one or more edges, which represent relationships between vertices. The NerdGraph call below makes use of these fields: accountId: Your New Relic account ID. fromVertexName: The name of the vertex the edge is starting from. toVertexName: The name of the connecting vertex. directed: A boolean that describes how vertices connect. true indicates a one-way relationship (for example, one service calling another) and false indicates . By default, directed = true.

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: allows you to configure your Nerdlet and write to your Nerdlet's URL state.",

      "body": "New Relic's Metric API can be used to send metric data to New Relic from a variety of sources. This API is how metrics from some of our integrations and exporters get into New Relic. Tip To use APIs and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is the Metric API? The Metric API is a way to get metric data into New Relic. The API works by sending a POST request to our HTTP endpoint with a JSON payload containing the metric data. The Metric API is how metrics are ingested from some of our integrations, including our open source exporters (like DropWizard, OpenCensus, and Prometheus). The Metric API is also used by our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that make it easier to use our data-ingest APIs. The Metric API can be used to: Report metric data to New Relic without a New Relic agent. Integrate metric data from an open source or in-house developed tool, library, or framework. Fully control the metric data you're sending, including the resolution and associated dimensions. Leverage the power of NRQL, New Relic's query language, for querying your metric data. Set up alerts for your metric data. Requirements Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name metric-api.newrelic.com or metric-api.eu.newrelic.com. Get started If we don't have an existing integration that meets your metric-reporting needs, you have two options: Use our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that help you send us metrics and other data. Use the Metric API directly. Access and requirements You'll need a New Relic Insert API key. For information on limits and restricted attributes, see Metric API requirements and limits. Find and use your data You can find data sent via the Metric API (including from integrations that use this API) in these locations: From one.newrelic.com, select Explorer and look for your service. By querying the Metric data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Metric Copy For more on querying, see Metric query examples. For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Troubleshooting If you receive an NrIntegrationError, see Troubleshoot a NrIntegrationError event.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for Outlier threshold types, optional for Static, and not allowed for Baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions, but not baseline or static Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remainig events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Tip To learn more about signal loss and how to request access to it, see this announcement. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you can't use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation . These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is the preferred API but if you are using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "The second version of our StatsD integration was released on May 25 2020. It's an improvement on our first StatsD integration. Improvements include: simpler configuration, and a simpler method for adding tags (key-value pairs). Features Our StatsD integration (version 2) lets you easily get StatsD-format data into New Relic. You can also add any arbitrary tags (key-value pairs) to your data. Once your metrics are in New Relic, you can query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Requirements This integration uses our Metric API and our Event API to ingest data. To use these APIs, you'll need an Insert API key. The integration adheres to the Metric API requirements and data limits. The default rate limit is 100,000 data points per minute (DPM). If you think you're missing metrics or sending more than 100K DPM, see Request data changes. To see if your account is hitting the rate limit, run the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' FACET category, message LIMIT 100 since 1 day ago Copy Install This section will explain how to do a standard install. If you want to run StatsD in Kubernetes, see Kubernetes install. To install the StatsD integration, run the following command and include your New Relic account ID and New Relic Insert API key. This generates a TOML configuration file used by gostatsd. docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy If your account is in the EU data center region, add this to the above command: -e NR_EU_REGION=true \\ Copy After installing, you can: Do optional additional configuration Define your metrics Add custom tags to your data Create alerts Install for Kubernetes Here are examples of Kubernetes manifests for deployment and service objects: Kubernetes manifest examples Below are examples of Kubernetes manifests to deploy StatsD in a Kubernetes environment and create a StatsD service named newrelic-statsd. You need to insert your account ID and your license key. deployment.yml: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: selector: matchLabels: app: newrelic-statsd replicas: 2 revisionHistoryLimit: 2 template: metadata: labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: containers: - name: newrelic-statsd image: newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 env: - name: NR_ACCOUNT_ID value: \"NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID\" - name: NR_API_KEY value: \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy service.yml: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: newrelic-statsd port: 80 targetPort: 8125 protocol: UDP selector: app: newrelic-statsd Copy For configuration details, see Kubernetes configuration. Configure In the install procedure, you run nri-statsd with environment variables, and this generates a TOML configuration file. Additionally, you can set these configuration options: Configuration options Description expiry-interval string If a metric is not updated for this amount of time, we stop reporting that metric. Default is 5m. If you want to send the metrics only if the value was updated between the flush intervals, configure this to 1ms. To never expire metrics, set it to 0. percent-threshold list of integers Specifies the percentiles used for metrics aggregation. Default: 90. metrics-addr string Indicates address on which to listen for metrics. Default: :8125. Tip To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the StatsD integration you must define the following endpoints in the custom configuration: address = 'https://gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/ $NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' Copy address-metrics = 'https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' Copy Here are some examples of customizing configuration by overwriting the default configuration: Example of custom configuration # Specify after how long do we expire metrics, default:5m expiry-interval = '1ms' # percent-threshold specify a list of percentiles for metrics aggregation, default:90 percent-threshold = [90, 99] backends='newrelic' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy Disable timer sub-metrics: By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. If you want to disable those metrics you can do it by adding a disabled-sub-metrics configuration section and set true for the ones you want disabled. Here's an example: # disabled-sub-metrics configuration section allows disabling timer sub-metrics [disabled-sub-metrics] # Regular metrics count=false count-per-second=false mean=false median=false lower=false upper=false stddev=false sum=false sum-squares=false # Percentile metrics count-pct=false mean-pct=false sum-pct=false sum-squares-pct=false lower-pct=false upper-pct=false Copy Docker: overwrite default configuration To overwrite the default nri-statsd configuration while running in a container, you can mount a configuration file inside the container. You can adopt the following template as needed for your situation. Example: backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To run the container with the file mounted in the appropriate path: docker run \\ ... -v ${PWD}/nri-statsd.toml:/etc/opt/newrelic/nri-statsd.toml \\ ... newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Kubernetes: overwrite default configuration The best approach to configure nri-statsd running in Kubernetes is to use a configMap and mount the configMap into the container. (This is a similar process to mounting the configuration file in Docker.) Example: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-statsd-config namespace: default data: nri-statsd.toml: | backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = '$NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To use the configMap, declare a volume on your deployment spec template and then declare a volumeMount on your container spec. Example: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment spec: template: spec: containers: .... volumeMounts: - mountPath: /etc/opt/newrelic/ name: nri-statsd-config volumes: - name: nri-statsd-config configMap: name: nri-statsd-config Copy Metric format The integration receives metrics using the StatsD protocol. Optionally, the sample rate can be configured and tags can be added. Here's the metric data format we use: <metric name>:<value>|<type>|@<sample rate>|#<tags> Copy Here are explanations of these fields: Field name Description < metric name> string Required. Name of the metric. < value> string Required. The metric type: c = counter g = gauge ms = timer @ < sample rate> float Optional for simple counters or timer counters. When many metrics must be sent, you can use sampling to reduce network traffic. The downside is a reduction in the resolution of the data. An example of how this would work for sample rates below 1: If you set this to 0.1, the counter would send a measurement one out of every 10 times. # < tags> string Optional. Tags attached to your metrics are converted into attributes (key-value pairs). For more on tagging options, see Tags. Metric types Here are the types of metrics and how to format them: Counter A counter measures the number of occurrences of an event. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. A counter can be incremented or decremented during the same flush interval by adding a sign to the value. In the following example, the counter value will be 2: counter:4|c counter:-2|c Copy At each flush, the current count is sent and reset to 0. If the count is not updated, at the next flush it will send the value 0. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Here’s an example of a counter that is being sampled 1 out of 10 times: counter:4|c@0.1 Copy Gauge A gauge represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include temperature, CPU usage, and memory. Here's an example: temperature:40|g Copy If the gauge is not updated, at the next flush it will send the previous value. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Timer The timer metric type measures timing data. By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. These are sent as sub-metrics in the following format: <metric_base_name>.std_dev <metric_base_name>.median <metric_base_name>.summary <metric_base_name>.sum_squares <metric_base_name>.mean <metric_base_name>.per_second Copy The configured percentiles will generate the following metrics. The percentile threshold value will be attached as a tag. <metric_base_name>.sum_squares.percentiles <metric_base_name>.sum.percentiles <metric_base_name>.count.percentiles <metric_base_name>.upper.percentiles <metric_base_name>.mean.percentiles Copy The percentile threshold can be tweaked with the percent-threshold config option. These can be controlled through the disabled-sub-metrics configuration section. Add tags (attributes) You can add tags to your data, which we save as attributes (key-value pairs). There are two options for adding tags: Add default tags that apply to all metrics: These apply to all metrics. They are fixed and don't change over time. Add metric-level tags: These apply to specific metrics and allow the value to be changed between two submits. Add default tags that apply to all metrics Add tags to metrics and events by defining an environment variable in the startup command. Here's an example that would create two tags: -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" Copy Here's that environment variable used in the startup command: docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Add metric-level tags When defining the metric format, you can add tags using this format: <bucket name>:<value>|<type>|#<tags> Copy In this example, <tags> is a comma-separated list of tags. Tags format is: simple or key:value. Here's an example NRQL query that includes a custom tag: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE environment = 'production' Copy Create alerts You can alert on StatsD data using NRQL alert conditions. Alert example This procedure walks you through sending some sample data and then creating an alert condition using that data. First, send this data to New Relic’s StatsD container: echo \"prod.test.num:32|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Next, create a NRQL alert condition using this query: SELECT latest(prod.test.num) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'prod.test.num' Copy Here's an image showing creating this NRQL alert condition. Notice that the sample data sent in is represented by the blue dot on the upper right of the chart. Now we can create the alert condition with these settings: Remember to set the Condition name. If a metric with a value above 50 is sent, then an incident is created and notified. The incident is closed automatically after 24 hours. To test that the alert is working, run this command: echo \"prod.test.num:60|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Find and use data To query your data, you'd use any New Relic query option. For example, you might run a NRQL query like: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'myMetric' and environment = 'production' Copy For more on how to query the Metric data type, see Query metric data. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why some services are raising alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the error alerts in your services. Step 1 of 8 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal have opened critical violations for high error percentages: Tip If you don't see all the same alerts, don't worry. The simulated issues happen at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. The deployment has created an alert condition for cases where a service's error percentage rises above 10% for 5 minutes or longer. A critical violation means that the service's conditions violate that threshold. Begin your investigation by selecting the Telco-Web Portal service name. Step 2 of 8 You're now on the web portal's APM summary page. The top graph, Web transactions time, shows you the service's response times. By default, it also displays periods of critical violation. On the right-hand side of the view, Application activity shows when violations opened and closed: From the left-hand navigation, select Events > Errors to learn more about the errors: At the bottom of the view, the Errors table shows you what errors occurred in the service along with number of times each error occurred. In this scenario, the only error in the service has the following message: bash Copy An error occurred during a downstream request to http://35.182.223.70:7001/api/inventory detail:response code 500 This is a helpful message that explains that the web portal made a request to another service, raised an error, and responded with a response code of 500, indicating an Internal server error. Since this message tells you that the error occurred while the web portal was making an outbound request, use distributed tracing to better understand the issue. Select Monitor > Distributed tracing from the left-hand navigation. Step 3 of 8 Distributed tracing provides end-to-end information about a request. In this case, you're looking for a request to the web portal that raised an error, so that you can better understand what happened during that request. Filter the table, by selecting the Errors column header twice, to order by descending counts: Select the first row in the table: This trace gives a lot of information about what happened with the request once the web portal received it. One of the things that the trace reveals is that the web portal made a GET request to Telco-Login Service and received an error. The trace indicates an error by coloring the text red. Select the row (called a span) to see more information about the request to the login service: Expand Error details to see the error message: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic Interesting! This message says that, at the time that the web portal made the GET request to the login service, the login service was not ready to accept traffic. Inspect the login service to dive further into the root cause of these cascading errors. Return to the APM page, and select Telco-Login Service. Step 4 of 8 Notice that the APM summary for Telco-Login Service has similar red flags to the ones in the web portal: Web transactions time has a red error indicator, and Application activity shows critical violations. More than that, the times that the errors occurred in both services match up (around 10:53 AM, in this example). Step 5 of 8 Web transactions time, in APM, shows that requests to the login service spend all their time in Java code. So, in the left-hand navigation, open Monitor > JVMs: Java Virtual Machines, or JVMs, run Java processes, such as those used by the login service. This view shows resource graphs for each JVM your service uses. Change the timeslice to look at data for the last 3 hours, so you can get a better idea of how the service has been behaving: Notice, in Heap memory usage, that the line for Used Heap rises consistently over 30 minute intervals. About two-thirds of the way through each interval, the line for Committed Heap (the amount of JVM heap memory dedicated for use by Java processes) quickly rises to accommodate the increasing memory demands. This graph indicates that the Java process is leaking memory. Step 6 of 8 Your Java process is leaking memory, but you need to understand the extent of the leak's impact. Navigate to the login service's host infrastructure view to dive a little deeper. First, go to the Telco-Login Service summary page and turn off Show new view: Then, scroll to the bottom of the page, and select the host's name: Right now, you can only select the host's name from the old version of the UI (we're working on it). So, make sure you toggle off Show new view. In this infrastructure view, Memory Used % for Telco-Authentication-host consistently climbs from around 60% to around 90% over 30-minute intervals, matching the intervals in the JVM's heap memory usage graph: Therefore, the memory leak effects the login service's entire host. Click and drag on Memory Used % to narrow the timeslice to one of the peaks: Now, compare this graph with the login service's Errors graph to see how they relate. Step 7 of 8 Open New Relic in a new tab. From APM, select Telco-Login Service. Then, navigate to Events > Errors. By comparing these graphs, you see that the memory percentage reached its peak at 10:25 AM (in this example) and then dropped off. You also see that errors started occurring in the login service just after that, at 10:26 AM. The message for those errors is the same one you saw earlier: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic This suggests that the memory leaks cause the application to fail for a time. To understand the error a bit more, select the error class from the table at the bottom of the view: The stack trace shows that the service raised an UnhandledException from a function called EnsureAppIsStarted: With the information you've collected so far, you can conclude that Telco-Login Service's Java code has a memory leak. Also, the login service restarts the application when it runs out of memory, and it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests while the app is restarting. You also know the login service is effecting the web portal, because that is what introduced you to this problem, but does the issue effect any other services? Step 8 of 8 Visualize service dependencies using service maps. First, navigate back to APM, and from Telco-Login Service, select Monitor > Service map: Both Telco-Web Portal and Telco-Warehouse Portal depend on Telco-Login Service. So, when the login service goes down, you start seeing errors in both portals. Extra Credit Use the same steps you used to investigate issues in the web portal to confirm there are issues in the warehouse portal. Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal raise alerts during critical violations The login service's Java processes leak memory When the login service's host, Telco-Authentication-host, runs out of memory, it restarts the login application While the login application is restarting, it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests When the web portal and the warehouse portal make requests to the login service while it's restarting, they receive errors and raise errors of their own Now, as a Telco Lite developer, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the memory leak. Congratulations! Learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why Telco-Warehouse Portal has slower-than-normal response times. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the high response times in your services. Step 1 of 6 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that the response time for Telco-Warehouse Portal is 43 seconds, much higher than the response times in other services: On the APM page, select the Telco-Warehouse Portal service name to see a summary of that service. The top graph in the summary view shows Web transactions time: You see several peaks, reaching almost 50,000 milliseconds—or 50 seconds! From this graph, you can actually gain a little more insight by toggling the colored components beneath the graph. For example, select Node.js: The graph changes to show only what the Node.js component contributes to the overall response time—less than 100 ms, in this example. Now, select Web external and deselect Node.js: External web traffic is the primary contributor to the high response times. That's a good start, but it doesn't tell the whole story. Next, dive deeper to find out which external service is causing the issue. Step 2 of 6 So, you know that Web external is the culprit of the high response times, but it's hard to tell why. External web traffic is all the requests made from your service to other services. This means you should look into what external requests that the warehouse portal makes to try to understand exactly what external service is the bottleneck. From the left-hand navigation, select Monitor > Distributed tracing: This view shows you requests to the warehouse portal. Select a request from the table at the bottom of the view to see a trace through that request: This trace shows that one external request contributes almost all of the total trace duration. Specifically, an external request to the Telco-Fulfillment Service contributes over 99% of the overall response time. This is good news! You own the fulfillment service, which means you can drill down for even more information. Select the offending row (called a span), and then select Explore this transaction: Step 3 of 6 You're now looking at the __main__:inventory_item transaction overview. Because you know that some part of this transaction is slow, you can use this overview to narrow your focus even further. Similar to how you modified the warehouse portal APM graph, you can look specifically at the components of this transaction to understand where the root cause of the slowness is. Another way to view this information is to scroll down to the Breakdown table in that same view: Function/__main__:inventory_item, a Python function, contributes over 99% of the overall response time. At this point, you know that Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow. You also know that the issue in the fulfillment service is local because over 99% of the request is spent in Python code, not external services. Navigate to the fulfillment service's summary page to look at the service as a whole, instead of this single transaction: Step 4 of 6 Scroll down on this view to familiarize yourself with the graphs it shows, such as Throughput and Error rate. At the bottom of the page, you can see a table with the fulfillment hosts. You can't currently drill into a specific host in the new UI (we're working on it), but you can in the old UI. Toggle Show new view to off and select the host link: Step 5 of 6 Now, you're looking at graphs in the infrastructure view for that service's host. Notice that CPU % has a lot of high spikes. Click and drag on the graph from the start of a spike to the end of it to narrow the timeslice to the period when CPU utilization goes up: If you compare this graph to the fulfillment service's transaction graph you looked at earlier, you'll see that soon after __main__:inventory_item begins executing, the CPU utilization of the host sharply rises to 100%! Step 6 of 6 Now, you understand the problem causing slow response times in the warehouse portal, but you don't know the extent of the issue. Using service maps, you can see all your services that depend on the fullfillment service. Navigate to the service map under APM > Telco-Fulfillment Service: This map shows you the fulfillment service's incoming and outgoing dependencies. Not only is Telco-Warehouse Portal dependent on the fullfillment service, but so is Telco-Web Portal! Select the web portal node to see that the fulfillment service also affects the web portal's response times: Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow The fulfillment service's Python function contributes over 99% of the response time Soon after the Python function starts executing, the host's CPU utilization spikes up to 100% The fulfillment service also affects Telco-Web Portal response times Now, as the developer behind the fulfillment service, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the CPU spikes. Congratulations! You can learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, you can tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Tip To use the data explorer and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces apps to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From data explorer you can access query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

Once you specify the data you want, your chart is ready to view. Your query automatically runs in basic mode as you make changes to the inputs. If using advanced (NRQL or PromQL-style) mode, run your query. Use your charts Once you have built your chart you can: Change the type of chart. Based on the data you specified, the query builder selects the chart type that displays your results most effectively. However, you can choose from other available chart types to present your data in the visual format that you want to use. Share your chart. Add your chart to a dashboard.",

Change the appearance of your chart When you run your query in advanced (NRQL) mode or view your chart while using basic mode to specify data, the query builder analyzes your data and applies a chart type that fits your data. For some queries, you'll have several options of chart types to choose from. To change chart type, use the Chart type menu to the right of the current chart. Each type in the list has a tooltip with information about using that type. Example of the chart type menu, showing a tooltip. Customize your charts While we try our best to optimize how we display your data, sometimes you may have other needs. To this end, you can customize charts to display information at your convenience. Tip Customizations are available depending on the chart type. Format date and time Tip For table and billboard charts. Customize the date and time format for tables and billboards: for each type of data, you can select if you want to leave it as it is, or modify the format as Numeric or Date. If data is a timestamp, you can choose how to represent the date and time: For numbers, select if you want us to auto-format them, or chose the number of decimals you want to see. Customize the Y axis Tip For line and area charts. On line charts and area charts you can adjust the Y axis to display the data within certain values by setting a minimum and maximum value for the axis. If no customization option is selected, dashboards automatically displays the full Y axis from 0 to the top value plus a margin. Enable or disable the legend Tip For line and area charts, and histograms. For line charts, area charts, and histograms, you can disable or enable the legend. Remove the other groups facet Tip For bar and pie charts, and tables. When faceting on bar charts, pie charts, or tables, and if the number of faceting on queries is larger than 2,000, the Other groups facet aggregates the rest of facets. With this customization you can select whether to see Other groups, or remove it. More chart-specific features For more chart type-specific features, see Chart types.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostConditions directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your module.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add module.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.12\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. Terragrunt is a thin wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state. In this guide, you will use Terragrunt to generate your Terraform configurations, create files with Terragrunt, and reuse the Terragrunt configuration to manage multiple environments. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic Infrastructure agent for your host. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: You will also need to install Terragrunt to follow this guide: bash Copy $ brew install terragrunt To follow the examples in this guide, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 6 Create a new configuration Terragrunt is a wrapper that provides extra tooling for your Terraform configurations. In the next steps, you will create a new configuration using Terragrunt, Terraform, and New Relic. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terragrunt-config && cd terragrunt-config In the new directory, create a terragrunt.hcl file, create a ./src directory, and create a ./environments directory: bash Copy $ touch terragrunt.hcl $ mkdir src $ mkdir environments Inside of your environments folder, create a folder named dev. In the ./src directory, create a main.tf and provider.tf files: bash Copy $ mkdir environments/dev $ touch src/main.tf $ touch src/provider.tf In the provider.tf file add the appropriate Terraform and New Relic provider configuration information: terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } Copy In the main.tf add a New Relic alert policy named DemoPolicy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Copy In the ./environments/dev directory create a new file named terragrunt.hcl bash Copy $ cd ./environments/dev/ $ touch terragrunt.hcl Within the dev folder update the terragrunt.hcl file by adding the following include statement. The include statement tells Terragrunt to use any .hcl confgiuration files it finds in parent folders. include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } Copy Next, add a Terraform block to provide Terragrunt with a Terraform source reference. terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Now you need to configure the provider with your New Relic account details. You will need your New Relic user API key and account ID. provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you have a single account: The account ID is displayed on the API keys page. If your organization has multiple accounts: From one.newrelic.com, select Entity explorer and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page. Tip Documentation about the New Relic provider is provided on the Terraform doc site. Update the provider.tf file to define the New Relic account variables that will help keep the Terraform configuration dynamic. variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy In your terminal, change directories to the environments/dev folder and run the command terragrunt init: bash Copy $ terragrunt init Terraform init sets up a bit of context, sets up environment variables, and then runs terraform init. You will see the following output: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. [terragrunt] [/Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev] 2021/02/02 13:30:31 Copying lock file [output] from /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev/.terragrunt-cache/e-PoBgWhdv3v8QGOtDQxS_WeYu4/ 69zjIFUfApJiUt8gFmi-6-dcPe8/.terraform.lock.hcl to /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy $ terragrunt plan Terragrunt starts to run but pauses to ask for the inputs to the New Relic account variables added to the provider.tf file. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2/02 13:32:08 Running command: terraform plan var.newrelic_account_id Enter a value: Interrupt received. Exit the terragrunt plan process with CTRL+C . In the environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl file, add an inputs block to provide the values for your New Relic account variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy The updated terragrunt.hcl only has the include, terraform, and inputs block include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Now, when you run terragrunt plan, Terragrunt will provide the input block's values, no longer prompting the command line for values. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Run terragrunt apply. After Terraform finishes process, check your New Relic account for the new Demo Policy. Step 2 of 6 Adding to your configuration Now that you have a basic New Relic configuration created, add configurations built in the Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides in this step. Tip If you haven't done the previous developer guides, you can copy the configurations for this section from the Terragrunt Intro Github Repo. Update the main.tf to include the additional terraform configurations. Update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy You have added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. To clone the module from GitHub, run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply. After Terraform is done processing, You will see your Demo Policy now has two conditions in your New Relic account and one alert channel attached. Step 3 of 6 Using your Environment as a Terragrunt Variable Using Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you are running to the name of the data you are creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create a new input for env_name inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy in the main.tf file add a new variable for 'env_name' variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Using string interpolation, add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks. resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to the configuration name. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Currently, the environment variable name is hardcoded into the root terragrunt.hcl file. You want to avoid having your variables hardcoded, using a terragrunt built-in function will pass the value. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use the path_relative_to_include() built-in function and pass the value has the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output, the env_name variable will have the entire ./environments/dev/ path. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Next, update the terragrunt.hcl to only include 'dev' as the env_name variable. Adding a locals block creates a local variable, using the replace built-in function will remove the unwanted parts of the relative path, and update the inputs block to use the local variable. locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output the env_name variable will now have 'dev:' added. Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Step 4 of 6 Storing the State Remotely At the moment, the state file is local. The next steps will update your Terraform configurations to remove the local state file and use a file stored remotely in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, various state files will need to be store in separate S3 buckets, not to override each other. Terragrunt allows you to generate files on the fly. Adding the remote_state block into the root level terragrunt.hcl file, you will generate a new file named backend.tf. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"my-terraform-state\" key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true } } Copy After adding the remote_state block, you will need to give the configuration for the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state. Tip To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Now, update the remote_state block to provide your S3 bucket and update the key to use the local environment variable created previously. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Next, run terragrunt plan. If you look in the Amazon S3 bucket, you will see a folder named envs. Within the envs folder is a directory called devs containing terraform.tfstate file. Tip To see the files created by Terragrunt, look inside of the ./environments/dev directory. There is a hidden directory named terragrunt-cache. Within the terragrunt-cache directory, you will see the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Step 5 of 6 Creating a New Environment Now that you have a working configuration for your dev environment, you will create a new environment reusing the dev configurations in the next steps. In the environments directory, create a new folder names nonprod. In the nonprod folder, create a new terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl In the nonprod terragrunt.hcl file copy over the configuration from the environment terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you are using a different account for your nonprod environment, you can update the inputs with a new New Relic account ID and API key. Inside of your nonprod directory, run terragrunt init then run terragrunt apply. In the output, you will see Terraform has created a new set of resources. The new resources should have the nonprod name prefixed. Step 6 of 6 Terragrunt has created two environments, but there is no difference between them other than the name. Adding variables in the configurations allows your configurations to be more dynamic. In the next steps, you will add variables to your configurations. In the main.tf add new variables for the Host Conditions modules cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage values: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy In the main.tf update the HostConditions module values to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Run terragrunt plan. In the output, the HostConditions values have changed to use the variable defaults. Next, you want to pass the values into your environment configurations by adding the inputs block variables. In the nonprod/terragrunt.hcl file, add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy Run terragrunt apply. In your New Relic account, you will see a new policy with configurations changed based on the environment. Conclusion Congratulations! You've used Terragrunt to generate your New Relic configurations and manage multiple environments. Review the Terragrunt Intro Example, New Relic Terraform provider documentation, and Terragrunt quick start to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "You can use alerts to set up notification channels, and attach those channels to policies. Your selected channels provide fast and consistent ways for the right personnel to be notified about incidents. For example, notifications allow you to include charts about the incident to provide context and share them with your team. Alerts offers several notification channels, including webhooks, Slack rooms, email, and more. You'll be notified by your notification channels when incidents are opened, acknowledged, or closed. This document explains the available notification channels and how to set them up. Tip This document is about alerts notifications. For general information about unsubscribing from other New Relic emails, including marketing emails, weekly reports, and announcements, see Unsubscribe from New Relic emails. View notification channels To see all notification channels in your account: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. Add or remove notification channels To set up a new notification channel: On the Notification channels, click New notification channel. Select the type of channel and complete other required steps for it. To add or remove a notification policy or channel: Select a specific notification channel, select Alert policies, and add or remove a policy. OR Select a specific policy, select Notification channels, and add or remove a channel. Instructions for specific notification channels These are the available notification channel types. User Requirement: This feature is not available for users on the New Relic One user model, only to users on the original user model (learn about user model differences). As a workaround, you can use the email notification channel. Use the User notification channel to select existing account team members and admins. To view the Users list or to add users to alert policies: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. If a user has configured the New Relic mobile app, the user notification channel also sends push notifications to any of the user's registered mobile devices. If your account has one or more sub-accounts, the notification channel includes only users for the currently selected master or sub-account. Email We automatically add every individual and their email address on the selected account to the User notification channel and you can select them there. You don't need to add existing New Relic accounts to the Email channel. To add an email channel for other users, follow these guidelines: Field Description Email (required) In general, use the Email notification channel to identify user emails or email aliases that are not already on the selected account. For example, if you have a dev-ops@company.com email alias for your DevOps team, add the email alias to the Email channel. Otherwise, use the User notification channel to select specific users on your DevOps team. For easier maintenance, add a single non-user email address or alias to a single alert notification channel. If you want to use the email channel for more than one email, create an email group or alias outside your account. These email addresses can be the same as or different from email addresses already on your account. Users can unsubscribe from general (non-alerts-related) emails, but they cannot unsubscribe from alerts email notifications. Instead, the account Owner, Admin, or add-on manager must remove users from the policy's email notification channel. Include JSON attachment (optional) To include a JSON attachment with the email notification, select this checkbox. OpsGenie You must have an existing OpsGenie account integrated with New Relic in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the OpsGenie notification channel (maximum 64 characters). API key (required) The API key generated from your OpsGenie integration used to authenticate API requests. Teams (optional) List of team names that are responsible for the alert. OpsGenie runs team escalation policies to calculate which users will receive notifications. Tags (optional) A comma-separated list of labels attached to the alert. Tip To overwrite the OpsGenie Quiet Hours setting for urgent alerts, add an OverwriteQuietHours tag. Recipients (optional) One or more names of users, groups, on-call schedules, escalation policies, etc., that OpsGenie uses to calculate where to send notifications. PagerDuty You must have an existing PagerDuty account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Service name (required) The name of your service integrating with PagerDuty for notifications. Integration key (required) The unique service identifier used by PagerDuty's Integration API to trigger, acknowledge, and resolve incidents for the service. Slack Before adding Slack notifications, you must create a unique webhook integration using Slack's New Relic integration. If you want web, transaction, server, and mobile alerts to be posted in separate channels, you must set up separate integrations for each one. Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the Slack notification channel (maximum 64 characters); for example, Network Ops Center. URL (required) Copy and paste the New Relic webhook integration URL that you've set up with Slack. For example: https://hooks.slack.com/services/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 Be sure to include https:// in the URL. Do not use http://. Team channel (optional) If used, include # before the name of the Slack channel where alert notifications are sent; for example, #NOC. VictorOps You must have an existing VictorOps account in order to provide the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for this notification channel (maximum 64 characters). For example, if the VictorOps Route key is for your Technical Support team, you could name this channel Tech Support - VictorOps. Key (required) VictorOps generates a unique key for each account. It maps the VictorOps account to its associated integrations. Route key (optional) This key maps the alert or incident to a specific team. Webhook Webhooks are HTTP POST messages containing JSON documents delivered to a destination URL. When an incident is opened, acknowledged, or closed, our webhook feature sends a message to your URL with any relevant information, such as a description of the event and a link back to New Relic. You also have the option to customize the payload in the POST message for further integration into your system. Important If your endpoint does not acknowledge the POST request within 10 seconds, the Alerts UI may indicate a failed notification event for the related incident. Before adding webhook notifications, you must have an endpoint set up to respond with a status code between 200 and 206 after receiving the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the webhook (maximum 64 characters). Base url (required) The endpoint that will receive the POST message and trigger customized behaviors in your system. Caution If you want to include a port number in the webhook URL, make sure the port is available for requests. Otherwise the webhook will not work. Basic auth (optional) To require basic authentication for the webhook, select Add basic auth, and provide the user name and password to authenticate the webhook. Custom headers (optional) To include headers with webhooks, select Add custom headers, and provide the name and value for each header. Use custom payload (optional) To use the default values, leave blank. To view and edit the default values, select Add custom payload. Payload (for custom payloads only) Your customized POST message code. This field includes: A list of variables you can use Syntax highlighting, based on payload type Payload type (for custom payloads only) Specify the message format: JSON (default) or Form. xMatters You must have an existing xMatters account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) Name your channel so you can identify it easily when associating it with a policy. Integration url (required) The unique integration url provided by xMatters pointing to your xMatters account. Receive mobile push notifications Important In order to receive mobile push notifications, your device must be registered and listed in (account) > User preferences. If the device is not listed in User preferences, log out of the app, log back in, and check again to see if it is listed. To receive mobile push notifications: Log in to your New Relic account via the mobile app at least once to ensure the device is registered. Add the user channel to the alert policy. Switch push notifications On for the device. Acknowledge alert notifications Anyone in your account can acknowledge notifications through the user interface or email notification. Acknowledging an incident in New Relic also acknowledges any associated incident in PagerDuty.",

      "body": "Every time you deploy an application, you hope that it's efficient and error-free. The reality, however, is usually quite different. You might introduce a bug in a release, overlook an edge case, or rely on a broken dependency. These issues, and others, can result in bad user experiences. In this guide, you: Use the open-source New Relic demo-deployer to spin up the infrastructure for Acme Telco Lite, a fictional company. This demo scenario is part of our Demo Catalog and will simulate real-world issues in a controlled, demo environment Use New Relic to understand those issues from the perspective of a Telco Lite developer Use the deployer to tear down the resources you create Welcome to Acme Telco Lite! Acme Telco Lite is a mock telecom business that maintains an eCommerce website for its customers. The site's architecture has eight, interconnected microservices, plus a simulator: The simulator isn't part of the Telco Lite infrastructure, but it is part of the demo deployment. It runs scenarios against the application to create web traffic and generate interesting data in New Relic. Set up your environment Before you begin, follow the Prerequisites guide from the deployer's GitHub repository for a detailed walkthrough of how to set up your environment. For this guide, you can choose between Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host your deployment. The guide steps you through: Installing Docker & pulling the demo-deployer image locally Creating a user config file containing credentials for New Relic and your cloud provider Downloading a .pem key file (if your cloud provider is AWS) Once you're all set up, deploy Acme Telco Lite. Deploy Telco Lite It's time to deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services using demo-deployer. Copy the url for the demo that corresponds to the cloud provider you chose when you set up your environment: AWS Telco Lite Demo Azure Telco Lite Demo GCP Telco Lite Demo Follow the Deployment guide in the Demo Catalog repository for a thorough explanation of how to use the deployer in a local Docker environment. When you run the deployment script, make sure to pass the url you copied for <demo-url>. Tip Since Telco Lite contains several services, the deployment can take over half an hour. When the deloyer is finished, you should see some output stating that the deployment was successful: bash Copy [INFO] Executing Deployment [✔] Parsing and validating Deployment configuration success [✔] Provisioner success [✔] Installing On-Host instrumentation success [✔] Installing Services and instrumentations success [INFO] Deployment successful!

View your services With your services running in the cloud, log in to New Relic and select APM from the top navigation to see how your services are holding up: Yikes! The alerts, high response times, and red-colored indicators suggest things aren't well. Use New Relic to diagnose these issues, which are simultaneously affecting your services: Issue 1: The Warehouse Portal has abnormally high response times Issue 2: Multiple services are raising error alerts Tip Don't worry if you don't see all the same alerts. The simulator triggers issues at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. Tear down Telco Lite When you're finished diagnosing all the issues effecting Telco Lite, follow the Teardown guide in the deployer's repository to tear down the services you created in your cloud provider. If you're still exploring, don't tear down your services, or you'll have to deploy them again later. Conclusion Congratulations, you're done! Throughout this tutorial, you: Used the demo-deployer to deploy Telco Lite to the cloud Used New Relic to investigate simulated issues in Telco Lite services Tore down all the infrastructural resources you created throughout this tutorial Hopefully, you learned a lot about using New Relic to investigate issues in your services. To get your hands on more features of New Relic, pick another demo from the catalog and spin it up with the deployer!",

      "info": "Learn how to use New Relic to diagnose error alerts in your services.",
      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why some services are raising alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the error alerts in your services. Step 1 of 8 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal have opened critical violations for high error percentages: Tip If you don't see all the same alerts, don't worry. The simulated issues happen at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. The deployment has created an alert condition for cases where a service's error percentage rises above 10% for 5 minutes or longer. A critical violation means that the service's conditions violate that threshold. Begin your investigation by selecting the Telco-Web Portal service name. Step 2 of 8 You're now on the web portal's APM summary page. The top graph, Web transactions time, shows you the service's response times. By default, it also displays periods of critical violation. On the right-hand side of the view, Application activity shows when violations opened and closed: From the left-hand navigation, select Events > Errors to learn more about the errors: At the bottom of the view, the Errors table shows you what errors occurred in the service along with number of times each error occurred. In this scenario, the only error in the service has the following message: bash Copy An error occurred during a downstream request to http://35.182.223.70:7001/api/inventory detail:response code 500 This is a helpful message that explains that the web portal made a request to another service, raised an error, and responded with a response code of 500, indicating an Internal server error. Since this message tells you that the error occurred while the web portal was making an outbound request, use distributed tracing to better understand the issue. Select Monitor > Distributed tracing from the left-hand navigation. Step 3 of 8 Distributed tracing provides end-to-end information about a request. In this case, you're looking for a request to the web portal that raised an error, so that you can better understand what happened during that request. Filter the table, by selecting the Errors column header twice, to order by descending counts: Select the first row in the table: This trace gives a lot of information about what happened with the request once the web portal received it. One of the things that the trace reveals is that the web portal made a GET request to Telco-Login Service and received an error. The trace indicates an error by coloring the text red. Select the row (called a span) to see more information about the request to the login service: Expand Error details to see the error message: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic Interesting! This message says that, at the time that the web portal made the GET request to the login service, the login service was not ready to accept traffic. Inspect the login service to dive further into the root cause of these cascading errors. Return to the APM page, and select Telco-Login Service. Step 4 of 8 Notice that the APM summary for Telco-Login Service has similar red flags to the ones in the web portal: Web transactions time has a red error indicator, and Application activity shows critical violations. More than that, the times that the errors occurred in both services match up (around 10:53 AM, in this example). Step 5 of 8 Web transactions time, in APM, shows that requests to the login service spend all their time in Java code. So, in the left-hand navigation, open Monitor > JVMs: Java Virtual Machines, or JVMs, run Java processes, such as those used by the login service. This view shows resource graphs for each JVM your service uses. Change the timeslice to look at data for the last 3 hours, so you can get a better idea of how the service has been behaving: Notice, in Heap memory usage, that the line for Used Heap rises consistently over 30 minute intervals. About two-thirds of the way through each interval, the line for Committed Heap (the amount of JVM heap memory dedicated for use by Java processes) quickly rises to accommodate the increasing memory demands. This graph indicates that the Java process is leaking memory. Step 6 of 8 Your Java process is leaking memory, but you need to understand the extent of the leak's impact. Navigate to the login service's host infrastructure view to dive a little deeper. First, go to the Telco-Login Service summary page and turn off Show new view: Then, scroll to the bottom of the page, and select the host's name: Right now, you can only select the host's name from the old version of the UI (we're working on it). So, make sure you toggle off Show new view. In this infrastructure view, Memory Used % for Telco-Authentication-host consistently climbs from around 60% to around 90% over 30-minute intervals, matching the intervals in the JVM's heap memory usage graph: Therefore, the memory leak effects the login service's entire host. Click and drag on Memory Used % to narrow the timeslice to one of the peaks: Now, compare this graph with the login service's Errors graph to see how they relate. Step 7 of 8 Open New Relic in a new tab. From APM, select Telco-Login Service. Then, navigate to Events > Errors. By comparing these graphs, you see that the memory percentage reached its peak at 10:25 AM (in this example) and then dropped off. You also see that errors started occurring in the login service just after that, at 10:26 AM. The message for those errors is the same one you saw earlier: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic This suggests that the memory leaks cause the application to fail for a time. To understand the error a bit more, select the error class from the table at the bottom of the view: The stack trace shows that the service raised an UnhandledException from a function called EnsureAppIsStarted: With the information you've collected so far, you can conclude that Telco-Login Service's Java code has a memory leak. Also, the login service restarts the application when it runs out of memory, and it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests while the app is restarting. You also know the login service is effecting the web portal, because that is what introduced you to this problem, but does the issue effect any other services? Step 8 of 8 Visualize service dependencies using service maps. First, navigate back to APM, and from Telco-Login Service, select Monitor > Service map: Both Telco-Web Portal and Telco-Warehouse Portal depend on Telco-Login Service. So, when the login service goes down, you start seeing errors in both portals. Extra Credit Use the same steps you used to investigate issues in the web portal to confirm there are issues in the warehouse portal. Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal raise alerts during critical violations The login service's Java processes leak memory When the login service's host, Telco-Authentication-host, runs out of memory, it restarts the login application While the login application is restarting, it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests When the web portal and the warehouse portal make requests to the login service while it's restarting, they receive errors and raise errors of their own Now, as a Telco Lite developer, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the memory leak. Congratulations! Learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Tip To use the data explorer and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces apps to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From data explorer you can access query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

Important Are you a New Relic Insights user? See our transition guide. Why it matters Modern business systems are a complex maze of data-generating elements. You need an easy, solid way to fetch, analyze, and visualize the never-ending stream of data flowing from your daily working activities. Use the query builder to: Quickly access your data and build customized charts to learn and understand the health of your infrastructure, applications, and other services. Add charts to your dashboards to obtain a complete real-time view of the state of your system. Share your charts with colleagues or users in just two clicks. Get acquainted with querying by using basic mode, then switch to advanced mode to refine your charts using NRQL. Get started Before querying, you may want to read Introduction to querying and how to explore your data. To find the query builder, go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data. Use the query builder: basic and advanced modes The query builder has several modes: Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Advanced (PromQL-style) mode Tip You can also switch to the Data explorer tab at any time to browse your data and create charts visually, without performing queries. Basic mode Basic mode doesn't require a query language, and so it's useful if you aren't familiar with NRQL or SQL. It's also a quick way to answer one-off questions, such as how many cities outside of the United States are accessing the shopping site for your company. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Basic mode Use basic mode to guide you through the process to specify data for a chart. With basic mode you can: Choose your data source. In basic mode, you start by selecting an event and then picking the attribute that corresponds to the information to show in your chart. Specify (filter) the data for your chart. You can narrow the results and choose an attribute to facet by. Select the time range to present in the chart. You can select a time range from the menu or use the custom option to create your own time range. See Use basic mode for more information about this feature. Advanced (NRQL) mode With the advanced (NRQL) mode you can create your own queries using the NRQL query language. NRQL queries may be simple or complex, depending on what data you want to use and how to display it in your chart. This example of the advanced mode shows the NRQL query with the same data as used in basic mode. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Advanced (NRQL). Use advanced (NRQL) mode to write a query that specifies data for a chart. Tip With APM's real time streaming, you can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in dashboards. See Use advanced (NRQL) mode for more information about using this feature. Advanced (PromQL-style) mode With the advanced (PromQL-style) mode you can run basic PromQL-style queries. You can switch between basic and advanced modes while defining your query in order to: customize some of the values. learn how NRQL queries are structured using the data you specified in basic mode. Important If you build your query in basic mode and update it using advanced mode, you cannot return to basic mode to edit that query. You must make any additional changes in advanced (NRQL) mode. Once you specify the data you want, your chart is ready to view. Your query automatically runs in basic mode as you make changes to the inputs. If using advanced (NRQL or PromQL-style) mode, run your query. Use your charts Once you have built your chart you can: Change the type of chart. Based on the data you specified, the query builder selects the chart type that displays your results most effectively.

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have accounts in GitHub and New Relic. To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in the New Relic One Catalog, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Install and configure the New Relic One CLI, before starting this one. A Nerdpack is a package that contains all the files that make up a New Relic One application or visualization. Nerdpacks include files for metadata, Nerdlets, assets, and more. To create a Nerdpack, use the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack When nr1 prompts for a component name, use \"ab-test\" and watch the tool create the foundations of your Nerdpack. Once it's finished, explore the files it created for you. Root directory At the root level, you have a directory called ab-test. Everything inside this directory is part of the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls ab-test README.md nerdlets nr1.json package.json launchers node_modules package-lock.json Readme.md provides instructions for creating Nerdpack elements and serving your application locally. This and nr1 --help are useful if you forget how to interact with your Nerdpack using the command line tool. Javascript files package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules are important for running your JavaScript application, but aren't unique to Nerdpacks. You can learn about these modules from JavaScript courses should you need to tweak them. For now, take a look at nr1.json, one of the most relevant files in this directory. Metadata file nr1.json is the Nerdpack's metadata file, containing a schema type, unique identifier, a display name, and a description. Since you’re building a New Relic One application for running and analyzing A/B tests, update the package's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and set the description to \"A/B test your application using New Relic One\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"311bcd0c-f7eb-4285-afed-4219179bf91d\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"A/B test your application using New Relic One.\" } nr1.json Copy It's good to describe your application's purpose, especially if you're going to publish your application for others to use. Next, look at the launchers and nerdlets subdirectories. Launchers launchers is a directory because you can create multiple launchers for your New Relic One application. nr1 create only created one launcher for your Nerdpack and called it \"ab-test-launcher\". Inside its directory, there are two files: icon.png is an image that represents the application nr1.json is the launcher's metadata file Use \"A/B Test Launcher\" for the launcher's displayName and \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\" for the description in nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"ab-test-launcher\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test Launcher\", \"description\": \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\" } launchers/ab-test-launcher/nr1.json Copy Notice that the launcher has a rootNerdletId. This identifies the Nerdlet that the launcher opens when it's selected. This Nerdpack has only one Nerdlet, called ab-test-nerdlet, but some Nerdpacks may have multiple. Make sure that you set the rootNerdletId to the Nerdlet you want the launcher to open. Nerdlets The nerdlets directory contains all the Nerdlets that make up your New Relic One application. Since ab-test-nerdlet is the only Nerdlet in this Nerdpack, there is only one subdirectory. In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, there are three files: index.js is the JavaScript file that contains your Nerdlet component styles.scss holds the Sass stylesheet for your Nerdlet nr1.json contains the Nerdlet's metadata Update your Nerdlet's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and description to \"Control and view results of your A/B test\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"Control and view results of your A/B test\" } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Now, you've customized your Nerdpack, Nerdlet, and launcher with informative display names and descriptions, but what does your application actually do? Check out index.js to see what your default Nerdlet looks like: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, ab-test-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you have AbTestNerdletNerdlet, which nr1 created for you. It's a React component that renders a first-level welcome heading. Because this is the root Nerdlet, as specified in your launcher's nr1.json file, when you click on your launcher in the New Relic platform, the launcher will open a view that displays this heading. Tip In this lesson, you used nr1 create to create a Nerdpack, complete with a launcher and a Nerdlet. If you want to create another Nerdlet or Launcher in your Nerdpack, you can also do that with nr1 create: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdlet $ nr1 create --type launcher You can even skip the --type flag and select an option from a list: bash Copy $ nr1 create ? What kind of component do you want to create? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit. nerdpack ❯ nerdlet - create a/an Nerdlet artifact inside your Nerdpack. launcher catalog visualization In the next lesson, you'll learn how to serve your Nerdpack locally and see your app in action!

Check your permissions To publish your Nerdpack and update its catalog information, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can update their catalog information. Update your Nerdpack's catalog metadata After you've published your Nerdpack to the New Relic One catalog, update the Nerdpack's metadata to let users know all about your Nerdlets or visualizations. Step 1 of 9 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 9 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 9 Find your published Nerdpack under New Relic One catalog: Notice that there is no information on the Apps or details page other than the Nerdpack's name and the brief description found in nr1.json: There are no screenshots, icons, details, or what's new features. To add these, your Nerdpack needs a catalog directory. Step 4 of 9 From the root of your Nerdpack, create a catalog directory to house your Nerdpack's screenshots and metadata: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog ✔ Component created successfully! catalog is available at \"./catalog\" Inside your catalog directory, you'll find specific files and directories for portraying information about your Nerdpack to your users: bash Copy $ ls catalog README.md additionalInfo.md config.json documentation.md screenshots File Description README.md A markdown file that instructs you how to use the information and metadata in catalog config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application.

Step 6 of 7 Submit this new metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots... ✔ Screenshots uploaded ✔ Updated metadata for DemoApp 1.0.1 Step 7 of 7 Go to the catalog and subscribe to your Nerdpack to see your new icon: Resolve issues with submitting catalog information Sometimes, when you work with catalog metadata, you may run into issues. Consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Publish your Nerdpack Remember that you can only submit catalog metadata for Nerdpacks that have already been published. If you try to submit information for a Nerdpack that hasn't been published, the CLI will try to help: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating DemoApp 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN Resize your images Screenshots for the catalog must meet the criteria specified previously in this guide.

      "body": "If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin Before you begin, we recommend first reading about permissions. To start building, you must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide.

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: allows you to configure your Nerdlet and write to your Nerdlet's URL state.",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Alerts & AI. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Create a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). And you can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data, as shown here: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads for a specific account. You can use tags to: Help organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts Identity teams, roles, environment, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases) Better organize and search dashboards and workloads Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you wanted to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events would be a better solution. Tip At New Relic, tags were previously called \"labels.\" You may sometimes see \"label\" used in our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Keep reading to learn more about tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, read the best practices below to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging (although tag searching is case-insensitive in the UI and API) Tips on cross-team implementation: One reason for using tags is to improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Keep this reference manual up-to-date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can apply tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries and charts As explained in Tag sources, some attributes are available as tags. You can query attributes and create custom charts using NRQL.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "You can generate metric-type data from other types of data in New Relic, including events, logs, and spans. Metrics are aggregates of your data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods. This document explains: Reasons to use this feature Available operations How to use our NerdGraph API tool to perform operations Why create metrics from other data types? Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage. This in turn allows you to query your data and build charts more easily. The difference between metrics and other types of data in New Relic is based on time. For more information, see Understand data types. Events, logs, spans: These types of data represent a single record at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your events, logs, or spans. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you can aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this information month over month. Why use metrics? Comments Flexibility Metrics are dimensional. You can choose what metadata (like host name or app name) is attached to them. Common metric measurements, like average, sum, minimum, and maximum, are already calculated. Data aggregation and retention The data has already been pre-aggregated into longer-period time buckets. Data retention is 13 months. Query capabilities You can query using the Metric data type. When you create metrics, this does not delete your events or other types of data. However, metrics are better for longer-range querying and charting. To get started converting your data to metrics, create a rule. Available operations To show, create, and delete rules for generating metrics from events, logs, or spans, use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. These operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing metrics rules). All operations are role-based in NerdGraph as the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics include: Create a rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule The method being called to delete a rule. deletes This takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Example response for the request: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsDeleteRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"id\": \"12\", \"name\": \"Test Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } Copy Enable or disable a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To enable or disable an existing rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics, use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation. The only difference is whether enabled is set to true or false. Example request to enable an existing metrics rule: mutation { eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsUpdateRule The method being called to update an existing rule and either enable it or disable it. updates This takes three required parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. enabled: To enable a disabled rule, set this to true. To disable a rule, set this to false. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Queries Query operations include: List all rules for a New Relic account You can list all rules in a New Relic account or return a specific rule. Example listing all rules for account 123456: query { actor { account(id:123456) { eventsToMetrics{ allRules{ rules{ id name enabled nrql description } } } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description query One of the basic API operation types. Used to query but not make changes. actor This specifies the current New Relic user. account(id: 123456) Specify the ID for the New Relic account where to retrieve data. eventsToMetrics Scope the data only for events-to-metrics, logs-to-metrics, or spans-to-metrics rules. allRules Returns all rules for that account. rules In the rules block, you can define what data you want returned. Available fields include: id name description nrql accountId enabled Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"allRules\": { \"rules\": [ { \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" }, { \"description\": \"Metric for duration\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"Duration Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy List rule by rule ID If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now you want to list its contents so you can review it. Example listing rule 36 for New Relic account 123456: query { actor { account(id: 123456) { eventsToMetrics { rulesById(ruleIds: \"36\") { rules { id name enabled nrql description accountId } } } } } } Copy For more details about the elements in this query, see List all rules. Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"rulesById\": { \"rules\": [ { \"accountId\": 123456, \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"36\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool You can use our GraphiQL tool to explore the data structure. You can also use it to build and run the operations to convert events, logs, and spans to metrics. To use this tool: Create the metrics operation's request with the required parameters. Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql, and paste your query into the box. To execute the operation, press Play. Or, to get the cURL format, select Copy as cURL.) Validate the response in the response box. Optional: To verify that your rule-creation operation was performed successfully, run a list query for that rule ID.",

      "body": "Use New Relic's metrics API service to define rules for creating metrics from your other types of data, such as events, logs, or spans. Recommendation: Before you begin, review our requirements and tips for creating rules. Create a metrics rule To create a rule for creating metrics from events, logs, or spans: Construct the metrics rule using NRQL. Construct a NerdGraph (GraphQL format) API request that contains your NRQL rule. Create the metric by making the API request. Once a metric is created, you can query and chart it using NRQL. Step 1. Create NRQL query rule The most important part of creating a metrics rule is constructing the NRQL query that defines the metric for your data from events, logs, or spans. You can create up to 10 metrics with a single NRQL query by following this procedure: Using New Relic's NRQL interface, construct a query for the metric you want to create. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT average(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy Edit the query to use one of the three available metric types: summary: Use if the query's function is min, max, sum, count, or average. uniqueCount: Use if the query's function is uniqueCount. distribution: Use if the query's function is percentile or histogram. This example query uses average, so use summary: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary (ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy This example query uses count on a non-numeric field: FROM ProcessSample SELECT count(hostname) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy For summary on a non-numeric field use summary(1): FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(1) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy Tip For more detailed information on using these metric types in rules, see Creating metric rules: requirements and tips. Decide on the attributes you want to attach to the metric, following the limits on the cardinality of unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations. Recommendation: Run a separate query to ensure this count isn't over 50,000 for a 24-hour window. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT uniqueCount(awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy To be able to aggregate and filter your metrics, add the attributes you want to attach to the metric using the FACET clause. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Set the name of the metric using the AS function. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Once your NRQL rule is complete, use it to create the API request. Step 2. Create API request After you build the NRQL rule to convert data from events, logs, or spans to metrics, continue with building the API request. You can use our NerdGraph API tool to explore the data structure and to construct and make your request. To check that the rule was created correctly, you can run a query to return that rule using its ID. For tips on querying the metrics you've created, see Query and chart your metrics. Example NerdGraph API request The following example NerdGraph API request uses the same NRQL rule from step 1. The IO Total Read Bytes Rule creates a metric named io.totalread.bytes. (The rule name can have spaces, which differs from the metric naming rules.) mutation { eventsToMetricsCreateRule(rules: { name: \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", description:\"Created by Zach on March 27, 2019. Used by team Network.\", nrql:\"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\", accountId: 123456 }) { successes { id name nrql enabled } failures { submitted { name nrql accountId } errors { reason description } } } } Copy In this request: Request elements Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsCreateRule The method being called to create a rule. rules Takes four parameters: name: The name of the rule. description: Optional. The description of the rule. We recommend you include information about who created the metric data and who will be using the data. accountId: The New Relic account ID where the events, logs, or spans live and the metrics will be created. nrql: The NRQL query that creates the rule. For more on this, see Create NRQL query. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a successful or failed response. Available parameters for these blocks include: id (ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled (enabled/disabled status) accountId ruleId and accountId If a failure occurs, then the submitted ruleId and accountId will be returned along with the error reason and error description. Example NerdGraph API response Here's an example of a returned response: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsCreateRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"46\", \"name\": \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", \"nrql\": \"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\" } ] } } } Copy Step 3. Create a metrics rule with API request When your API request is ready, you can use the NerdGraph API to make the request, which will create the metrics. Query and chart your metrics After you create a metrics rule to convert data for your events, logs, or spans, you can view the new metric data in the New Relic UI. To view your data: Go to New Relic's NRQL query interface. Run the following query to see the name of all your metrics: SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric Copy Pick the metric of interest, then run the following query to see the available attributes: SELECT * FROM Metric where metricName = 'yourMetric' Copy If you don't see expected data, follow the troubleshooting procedures. The available NRQL aggregator functions depend on the metric type you created. Here are some examples. Summary metric example If you created a summary metric type, you can use the count, sum, max, min, and average aggregator functions, as shown in the following query: SELECT count(appStartResponseTime), sum(appStartResponseTime), max(appStartResponseTime), min(appStartResponseTime), average(appStartResponseTime) FROM Metric Copy Count metric example If you created a uniqueCount metric type, you can only use the uniqueCount function, as shown in the following query: SELECT uniqueCount(playbackErrorStreamUniqueCount) * 100 / uniqueCount(streamUniqueCount) AS '% of Streams Impacted' FROM Metric Copy Distribution metric example If you created a distribution metric type, use the percentile or histogram functions, as shown in the following queries: SELECT percentile(service.responseTime, 95) FROM Metric Copy OR SELECT histogram(service.responseTime, 10, 20) FROM Metric Copy Troubleshooting If your NerdGraph call is not constructed correctly, you may receive a message like this: Cannot parse the unexpected character \"\\u201C” Copy Verify the quotes in the NerdGraph call are not smart quotes (curly quotes). Our NerdGraph API only accepts straight quotes.",

      "body": "When you connect your data to New Relic, we process what we receive and apply data dropping and transformation rules. Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and account/user structure. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and LogExtendedRecord Metric group: LoggingBytes Log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes Namespaces that contain all tracing events, including tracing spans and excluding internal tracing. Browser:EventLog Browser Browser:JSErrors PcvPerf (PageView timing) Browser events Metric group: BrowserEventsBytes Lambda Serverless Metric group: ServerlessBytes Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Alerts & AI. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Create a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

Check your permissions To tag a Nerdpack version, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can tag them. Tag a version After you've published a Nerdpack version to the New Relic One catalog, you can tag it with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 2 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. Here, you tagged version 1.0.0 as DEV. Now, you, and other users on your account, can use this tag: You see the tag as an option to subscribe to when you add the Nerdpack to your account If you subscribe to the DEV tag and it gets updated later—say, DEV is applied to version 1.0.1—you automatically get upgraded to the new version without having to subscribe again. Important One of the features of tagging release versions is that users who are subscribed to a tag automatically get updates when that tag is used for another version. This means that if a user is testing one version, say 1.0.0, and you apply that same tag to another version, say 1.0.1, that user will see version 1.0.1 in their account, and they can no longer access the Nerdpack they were testing before. Often times, this is the expected behavior, but make sure you consider this side effect when you use tags. Step 2 of 2 View your Nerdpack's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 5 hours ago DEV This output confirms your DEV tag on version 1.0.0. Untag a version As you build more versions of your Nerdpack, you may update your tags to newer versions. However, you can also remove a tag from your Nerdpack with nr1. Step 1 of 3 From your Nerdpack's root directory, view your registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ---- 2.0.0 a few seconds ago DEV 1.0.1 8 minutes ago BETA, STABLE 1.0.0 6 hours ago Here, you see that version 1.0.0 has no tags, version 1.0.1 has two tags, BETA and STABLE, and version 2.0.0 has one tag, DEV. Step 2 of 3 Remove the BETA tag from your Nerdpack versions: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:untag --tag=BETA ✔ Removed nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 tag BETA. Step 3 of 3 Verify that the tag was removed from your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- -------------- ---- 2.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV 1.0.1 13 minutes ago STABLE 1.0.0 6 hours ago Resolve issues with tagging a Nerdpack version Sometimes, when you tag to a Nerdpack version, you may come across issues. Whether you can't tag your Nerdpack or you can't untag your Nerdpack, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Publish your Nerdpack If you try to tag your Nerdpack without first publishing it, you'll get an error: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV › Error: A downstream error occurred. This error message doesn't say much, but you can use the --verbose option to see more information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV --verbose init version: @oclif/command@1.8.0 argv: [ '--tag=DEV', '--verbose', [length]: 2 ] dist/metadata.json does not exist. package.json will be used instead. Using profile account-1234567 Request: POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Data: mutation nerdpackTagVersion( nerdpackId: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", versionTag: tag: \"DEV\", version: \"1.0.0\" } ) nerdpackId tags version } } Headers: 'API-Key': '<YOU USER KEY>', 'Content-Type': 'application/graphql' } This more verbose error message shows the GraphQL that runs behind the scenes for nr1 nerdpack:tag. The important part of the message here is: bash Copy dist/metadata.json does not exist. package.json will be used instead. The dist directory is created when you publish your app. So, because it hasn't been published yet, this directory doesn't exist and nr1 falls back to package.json to look for details about your Nerdpack. But, because the UUID in your package.json isn't in the New Relic registry, the command failed. So, before you tag your versions, publish them to the registry: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV Tip Remember that you can also tag a version at the same time you deploy it! bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag=DEV Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack You can only remove tags that have no subscribers. If you try to remove a tag that users are subscribed to, you'll get an error: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 2.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 3 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 2.0.0 an hour ago DEV 1.0.1 an hour ago 1.0.0 6 hours ago $ nr1 nerdpack:untag -t DEV › Error: A downstream error occurred.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start.

      "body": "Publish your Nerdpack, whether it's still in development, ready for testing, or stable, to share it with others. Check your permissions When you publish your Nerdpack, it's registered with the New Relic One catalog. From there, some users can subscribe to your Nerdpack. Subscribing users need to have: Access to the account that published the Nerdpack The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Update your package version You can only publish a package version to the catalog one time. For example, you can't publish two instances of version 1.0.0. So, each time you want to deploy a new version of your code, you need to increment its version in the Nerdpack's package.json file: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy Tip Nerdpack versions follow semantic versioning. Read the documentation to learn more. Generate a UUID for your Nerdpack If you built your Nerdpack from scratch with nr1 create --type nerdpack, then your Nerdpack has a unique identifier. Find this identifier in the root directory's nr1.json file: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"DemoApp\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack demo-app\" } nr1.json Copy This ID must be unique to your Nerdpack when you publish it to the catalog. The platform will reject your Nerdpack if it recognizes the ID. So, if you cloned an existing Nerdpack or are otherwise using open source code, generate a new UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --generate --force Tip Read the nr1 nerdpack:uuid documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --help Publish your Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish If you've successfully published your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This output describes the published Nerdpack. First, it states the Nerdpack's ID (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890). Then, its version (1.0.0). Finally, its version tag (STABLE). You already managed your Nerdpack's ID and version, but the version tag is new. To manage your Nerdpack's versions, you can tag them with an arbitrary tag. For example, if a version is still in development, you can tag it with a DEV tag. If the version moves to a QA phase, you can tag it with QA. If it's ready for production, you can tag it with STABLE. Tip Read our tag guide to learn more. Use the -t or --tag option to publish your Nerdpack with a tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag DEV As you saw in the nr1 nerdpack:publish output, if you don't pass a tag, nr1 applies the STABLE tag automatically. However, you can tell it to not apply any tags to a release with the -T or --skip-tag option: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --skip-tag You can also perform a dry run to make sure you publish your Nerdpack the way you want to: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --dry-run Step 2 of 4 Once you've successfully published your Nerdpack, go to New Relic: Because you're going to view a published Nerdpack, rather than a locally served one, you don't need to pass the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to Apps: Whether you published a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Apps. Step 4 of 4 Find your published Nerdpack under New Relic One catalog: Notice the Custom indicator on its UI tile. Use this to distinguish between published Nerdpacks and locally-served Nerdpacks. Tip Only Nerdpacks with tagged versions are shown under New Relic One catalog. So, if you published without a tag or removed a tag from your published Nerdpack, you won't see it in the catalog. Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you publish your Nerdpack, you may come across issues. Whether you can't publish your Nerdpack due to some issue with your code or you can't find your Nerdpack in the catalog, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your command When you attempt to publish your Nerdpack, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. For example: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack DemoApp (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890) › Error: There is already a Nerdpack with given id & version. › Code: 409 It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --verbose Reveal your published Nerdpack information If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, it may not be tagged. Remember, at least one version of your published Nerdpack must have a tag for it to show on the Apps page. See more information about your published Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:info: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 3014918 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 3 hours ago In this example, there is one published version, but it isn't tagged. You can tag a published version with: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --from-version=1.0.0 --tag=DEV Now, if you refresh your browser page, you should see your Nerdpack on Apps. Tip Read our nr1 nerdpack:tag documentation to learn more. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you publish your Nerdpack, only users who can access your account can see your published Nerdpack. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic but you know it's published, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same.",

Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack under New Relic One catalog: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the New Relic One catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel. Tip nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:unset. Read the nr1 subscription:unset documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:unset --help Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you subscribe to a Nerdpack, you may run into issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the New Relic One catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published to the catalog, you can view it by visiting the Apps page of New Relic: From the catalog UI, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top right of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app in the catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack.

Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Before you begin Explore our custom visualization guides and build your first visualization. After you're done, you'll have a better foundation for building more complex visualizations, such as the one you'll build in this course. Finally, if you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create your visualization Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called radar-or-treemap, in a Nerdpack, called alternate-viz: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name radar-or-treemap ✔ You’re trying to create a visualization outside of a Nerdpack. We’ll create a Nerdpack for you—what do you want to name it? … alternate-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack alternate-viz is available at \"./alternate-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization radar-or-treemap is available at \"./alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/radar-or-treemap directory under alternate-viz: bash Copy $ cd alternate-viz $ ls visualizations/radar-or-treemap index.js nr1.json styles.scss Set up your component state Add component state to the default visualization template that nr1 created for you. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap/index.js. You'll work in here for the rest of this lesson.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type. Use SegmentedControl and SegmentedControlItem to switch between the two chart types. Tip To learn more about the components available in the New Relic One SDK, go to our Intro to New Relic One SDK.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One app catalog. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl.

Step 4 of 8 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The nerdpacks=local query string directs the UI to load your visualization from the local server. Step 5 of 8 Open the Apps page: Step 6 of 8 Go to Custom Visualizations, which is favorited by default: Step 7 of 8 In Custom Visualizations, find and click your visualization: Step 8 of 8 Notice the new Select chart configuration option: Selecting a chart type doesn't effect your visualization. This is because you first need to introduce the selectedChart property to the visualization component. Then, you use selectedChart to determine the chart type to render. Replace your SegmentedControl with the configurable property Step 1 of 5 Open your visualization's index.js file. You'll be working here for the rest of the guide.

      "body": "In your application, you can display data in charts, like those used elsewhere in New Relic's user interface. The New Relic One SDK provides React components for different chart types. Once you decide the kind of data you want to present, either from New Relic or some other source, you supply that data to your chart, using props. Query New Relic data In some cases, you want to fetch data from New Relic's database. For example, you may want to display a line chart which plots the number of transactions your application receives over time. With your chart component, set the accountId and query props to query your New Relic data using NRQL: <LineChart accountId={1234} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" />; Copy Alternatively, you can fetch data with a NrqlQuery and set the data prop: <NrqlQuery accountId={1234} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\"> {({ data }) => <LineChart data={data} />} </NrqlQuery>; Copy If you're looking to visualize New Relic data, such as your web application's response times or your server's throughput, querying data in your charts is the way to go. But what if you want to create charts that aren't focused on New Relic data? The data prop is flexible enough that you can supply any arbitrary data, as long as it matches the standardized format. Craft custom data Whether you use custom data sets or the results of a NrqlQuery, a chart's data prop must be an array of objects where each object has both of the following fields: metadata: Defines how the chart presents its data data: An array of data points that appear on the chart For example, create a chart consisting of a line between two points by supplying two x-y coordinates in its data field: const data = [ { metadata: { id: 'series-1', name: 'My series', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0, }, { x: 20, y: 10, }, ], }, ]; <LineChart data={data} />; Copy This LineChart plots a line between coordinates (0, 0) and (20, 10). Use x-y coordinates for all two-dimensional chart formats. For other formats, which you'll learn more about later, use other types of data points. Because data accepts an array, you can supply two series to the same chart: const data = [ { metadata: { id: 'series-1', name: 'My series', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0, }, { x: 20, y: 10, }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'series-2', name: 'My second series', viz: 'main', color: 'red', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 50, }, { x: 20, y: 100, }, ], }, ]; <LineChart data={data} />; Copy In this example, you create a single chart with two series. The first series contains the line from the last example. The second series contains a line between points (0, 50) and (20, 100). When using two series in a single chart, like this, you may want to define how the chart represents each series. Use metadata to define those elements. Metadata A series's metadata defines certain features of the series, itself, such as how it should be displayed in your chart. metadata consists of the following attributes: Attribute Description id The series's identifier. Two series having the same id are considered the same series, regardless of where they are located. In general, use a unique id for each series. However, if you use the same series for multiple charts, keeping the id consistent can help with some cross-chart functionality, like simultaneously highlighting multiple charts. name The series's name. name is used in legends, tooltips, and other areas to indicate which series you’re looking at. color The series's color. Most visualizations use this value to differentiate series. Some visualizations, like BillboardChart or JsonChart, ignore it. Use any valid CSS color representation, such as #RRGGBB, hsl(HHH, SS%, LL%), or rgba(RR, GG, BB, .AA). Avoid tweaking the alpha value, when possible, because charts use alpha to highlight or dim certain series. viz The series's visual style. While you most often use main, this field accepts several options: main: Show the series based on chart's type. For instance, a LineChart shows the series as a line, and an AreaChart shows the series as an area. line: Show the series as a line, regardless of the chart's type. This setting applies only to AreaChart and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. area: Show the series as an area, regardless of the chart's type. This setting applies only to LineChart and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. event: Show the series as an event, regardless of the chart's type. Charts represent an event as a vertical area behind the main visualization. Events are often used to show alerts. This setting applies only to AreaChart, LineChart, and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. target-line: Show the series as a vertical line. This setting applies only to AreaChart, LineChart, and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. units_data You can assign a unit type to each axis on a chart. The chart will present data according to the unit type you set with units_data. To set unit_data, pass a JSON object with maps the axis to one of the following unit types: UNKNOWN: The chart displays the series with no special units. COUNT: Each value in the chart represents a count. The chart formats values with their International System prefix. For example, \"k\" represents thousands, \"M\" represents millions, and \"G\" represents billions. PERCENTAGE: Each value in the chart represents a percentage. Typically, you provide values ranging from 0 to 1. The chart formats a value of 1 as \"100%\", a value of 2 as \"200%\", and a value of 0.01 as \"1%\". MS: Each value in the chart represents some number of milliseconds. The chart represents values higher than 1 as a human-readable time duration. For example, 60000 is represented as \"1 minute\". The chart represents values lower than 1 using SI prefixes. For example, 0.001 is represented as 1 μs. TIMESTAMP: Each value in the chart represents a timestamp, the number milliseconds since midnight UTC on January 1, 1970, the UNIX Epoch. The chart formats each value as a date. BITS: Each value in the chart represents some number of bits. The chart formats these values using \"b\". When upscaling, the chart will display decimal prefixes instead of binary ones. For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kb\". BITS_PER_SECOND: Each value in the chart represents some number of bits per second. The chart formats these values using \"b/s\". When upscaling, the chart will display decimal prefixes instead of binary ones. For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kb/s\". BYTES: Each value in the chart represents some number of bytes. The chart formats these values using \"B\". For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kB\". BYTES_PER_SECOND: Each value in the chart represents some number of bytes per second. The chart formats these values using \"B/s\". For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kB/s\". So, to represent the y-axis for your series in bits, set the y-value in units_data: { \"units_data\": { \"y\": \"BITS\" } } Data While a data series can contain any arbitrary values, a chart only uses values which adhere to its type. So, create your data points according to the chart type: Series Type Example Description Unidimensional [{ \"y\": 10 }, { \"y\": 20 }] The chart plots data points using y values. Use this format with BarChart, BillboardChart, PieChart, StackedBarChart. Two-dimensional [ { \"x\": 10, \"y\": 20 }, { \"x\": 20, \"y\": 30 } ] The chart plots data points using x and y values. Use this format with AreaChart, LineChart, ScatterChart, SparklineChart, Funnel [{ \"label1\": 10, \"label2\": 20 }] The chart plots data according to labels. Use this format with FunnelChart. Table [{ \"jobType\": \"SIMPLE\", \"count\": 18 }] The chart plots data according to table columns. You must specify table columns in the metadata. Use this format with TableChart. Event [ { \"x0\": 0, \"x1\": 5 }, { \"x0\": 10, \"x1\": 15 } ] The chart plots the event's width based on x0 and x1 values. Histogram [ { \"x0\": 10, \"x1\": 20, \"y\": 100 }, { \"x0\": 30, \"x1\": 40, \"y\": 150 } ] The chart plots the series's width based on x0 and x1 and height based on y. Use this format with HistogramChart and HeatmapChart. Tip JsonChart is a special case because it processes any valid data. For example, you can set an arbitrary JSON object for the chart's data: const data = { data: [ { id: 1, name: 'Foo', price: 123, tags: ['Bar', 'Eek'], stock: { warehouse: 300, retail: 20, } } ], } <JsonChart data={data} /> Copy Special States In previous sections, you learned that a chart's data is an array of series. But you can use special values to present special chart states: null or undefined: Indicates the chart is “loading” its data. In this state, the chart shows a placeholder data set. []: Indicates there is no data to show. The chart states, \"No chart data available\". Configure your chart As you've seen, you use query or data to supply data to your chart, but you can configure other aspects of your chart, too, such as visual settings and click and hover event listeners. Read the documentation for the chart you're using for more specific information. Chart Groups Under some circumstances, you might want to synchronize events, such as dragging or scrubbing, across multiple charts. To do this, use a ChartGroup. All charts in a ChartGroup synchronize their events: <ChartGroup> <Stack> <StackItem> <LineChart accountId={1} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago\" /> </StackItem> <StackItem> <AreaChart accountId={1} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Synthetics SINCE 1 day ago\" /> </StackItem> </Stack> </ChartGroup>; Copy Ideally, group charts that are conceptually related, and separate charts that are conceptually unrelated. Next Step Read the documentation specific to the chart you'd like to use to learn specifics about that chart's behavior and configuration.",

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] }, \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start. You’re ready to build an application with the New Relic One CLI! Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that each require their own type of API key to use. This resource describes our API keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. Manage API keys in UI Here's a direct link to the API keys UI page. To find this from the New Relic UI: From the account dropdown, select Account settings. Select API keys. Overview of API keys The table below summarizes our available API keys and their uses. Important Some keys are able to be used by more than one API. If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. Key type What it's for Where to access User key (Also known as a \"personal API key\") Used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints (dependent on user permissions). API keys UI License key Allows ingestion of data from APM agents, the infrastructure agent, and some other data-ingest APIs. API keys UI Insights insert key (Also known as a \"Insert key\") Allows ingestion of events via HTTPS request from our metric, log, trace, and event APIs and the tools that use those APIs. Go to the API keys UI and click Insights insert key. Browser key Allows ingestion of browser monitoring data. API keys UI Mobile key (aka \"mobile app token\") Allows mobile monitoring data to be sent to New Relic. See Mobile app token. REST API key Note: we recommend using the user key instead because it has fewer limitations. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, Browser, Infrastructure alerts, as well as Mobile REST APIs and the API Explorer. Go to the API keys UI and click REST API key. Admin API key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. For more information, see Admin key and User key below. API keys UI (will appear as user keys) Insights query key (aka \"Query key\") This key allows use of the Insights query API. Note: we now recommend using NerdGraph to query New Relic data. Go to the API keys UI and click Insights query key. User key New Relic user keys (previously referred to as \"personal API keys\") are required for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API), which allows you to query most New Relic data and do some types of configuration. User keys also let you use our REST API, with restrictions based on your permissions. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a user key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select User. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key. In the Notes field, add relevant details about the key. Click Create. Edit a user key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the user key you want to edit, click ... and select Edit. Make your changes and click Update key. Delete a user key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the user key you want to delete, click ... and select Delete. Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. Tip In December 2020, user keys supplanted Admin API keys. For details, see Admin API key. License key New Relic license keys allow the ingestion of data from APM agents, the infrastructure agent, and some other data-ingest APIs. If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required or recommended. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a license key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select License. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key. In the Notes field, add relevant details about the key. Click Create. Edit a license key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the license key you want to edit, click ... and select Edit. Make your changes and click Update key. Delete a license API key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the license key you want to delete, click ... and select Delete. Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. Important You can't manage or delete an original license key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Browser key The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a browser key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select Browser. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key. In the Notes field, add relevant details about the key. Click Create. Edit a browser key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the browser API key you want to edit, click ... and select Edit. Make your changes and click Update key. Delete a browser key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the browser API key you want to delete, click ... and select Delete. Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. Important You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. REST API key Important We recommend using a user key to use the REST API because that key has fewer limitations. You can use a REST API key with our REST API and the API Explorer. For parent accounts with sub-accounts, each sub-account must use its own REST API key. Availability: Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. Activate or change REST API key Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Click Regenerate REST API key. Click (Show key) to view your account's new REST API key. Copy your account's REST API key to use with New Relic's REST API. View REST API keys To view REST API keys: Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Click (Show key) to view your account's new REST API key. Delete REST API key To delete your account's REST API key: Before you delete an API key, make sure you have the correct account or sub-account. Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Select the delete icon for the REST API key. Confirm the deletion by typing DELETION IS FOREVER in the text field. Select Delete. Insights insert key The Insights insert key (aka the \"Insert key\") is required for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. Generate an Insights insert key Go to the API keys UI and select Insights insert keys. Next to the Insert keys heading, select the button. A cURL command containing your insert key will appear, as well as NRQL query field. Edit the NRQL query field. Add comments in the Notes field if desired. Click Save your notes. Edit or delete an Insights insert key Go to the API keys UI and select Insights insert keys. Under Insert Keys, find the key you want to modify. Select Edit or Delete. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. Generate an Insights query key You must have access to the UIs you plan to query and the correct permissions in order to register or modify this key. Important Insights query keys are generated per account; they're not associated with a specific user. This means that any user in an account with access to a query key can use it. To register this key: Go to the API keys UI and select Insights query keys. Next to the Query Keys heading, select the button. A cURL command containing your insert key will appear, as well as NRQL query field. Edit the NRQL query field. Add comments in the Notes field if desired. Click Save your notes. Edit or delete an Insights query key To edit or delete this key: Go to the API keys UI page and select Insights query keys. Under Query Keys, find the key you want to modify. Select Edit or Delete. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily.",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Alerts & AI. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Create a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

In this guide, you learn how to: Use the nr1 CLI to generate a default visualization Run your visualization locally where you can quickly test and iterate Publish your visualization to the New Relic One catalog Add your visualization to a dashboard Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create a new visualization Use nr1 to generate the boilerplate for a new visualization. Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called my-awesome-visualization, in a Nerdpack, called my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name my-awesome-visualization ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ... my-awesome-nerdpack ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-awesome-nerdpack is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization my-awesome-visualization is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another. Step 4 of 4 In index.js, change your component's Radar.fillOpacity: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 } from 'recharts'; 10 import {Card, CardBody, HeadingText, NrqlQuery, Spinner, AutoSizer} from 'nr1'; 11 12 export default class MyAwesomeVisualizationVisualization extends React.Component { 13 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 14 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have accounts in GitHub and New Relic. To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in the New Relic One Catalog, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One app catalog. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart.

Add a new configuration option Step 1 of 8 In your visualization's nr1.json file, add an enum configuration object for selectedChart: index.js nr1.json 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 'Radar': 'radar', 24 'Treemap': 'treemap' 25 } 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

Step 3 of 8 Serve your Nerdpack locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve If you're still serving your Nerdpack from the last lesson, you need to stop it with CTRL-X and serve it again to reflect changes to nr1.json. Step 4 of 8 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The nerdpacks=local query string directs the UI to load your visualization from the local server. Step 5 of 8 Open the Apps page: Step 6 of 8 Go to Custom Visualizations, which is favorited by default: Step 7 of 8 In Custom Visualizations, find and click your visualization: Step 8 of 8 Notice the new Select chart configuration option: Selecting a chart type doesn't effect your visualization. This is because you first need to introduce the selectedChart property to the visualization component. Then, you use selectedChart to determine the chart type to render. Replace your SegmentedControl with the configurable property Step 1 of 5 Open your visualization's index.js file. You'll be working here for the rest of the guide. Step 2 of 5 In render(), include selectedChart as a constant you get from destructuring props, and remove your component's state: index.js nr1.json 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 'Radar': 'radar', 24 'Treemap': 'treemap' 25 } 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start. You’re ready to build an application with the New Relic One CLI! Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called my-awesome-visualization, in a Nerdpack, called my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name my-awesome-visualization ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ... my-awesome-nerdpack ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-awesome-nerdpack is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization my-awesome-visualization is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another. Step 4 of 4 In index.js, change your component's Radar.fillOpacity: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 } from 'recharts'; 10 import {Card, CardBody, HeadingText, NrqlQuery, Spinner, AutoSizer} from 'nr1'; 11 12 export default class MyAwesomeVisualizationVisualization extends React.Component { 13 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 14 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Before you begin Explore our custom visualization guides and build your first visualization. After you're done, you'll have a better foundation for building more complex visualizations, such as the one you'll build in this course. Finally, if you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create your visualization Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called radar-or-treemap, in a Nerdpack, called alternate-viz: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name radar-or-treemap ✔ You’re trying to create a visualization outside of a Nerdpack. We’ll create a Nerdpack for you—what do you want to name it? … alternate-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack alternate-viz is available at \"./alternate-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization radar-or-treemap is available at \"./alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/radar-or-treemap directory under alternate-viz: bash Copy $ cd alternate-viz $ ls visualizations/radar-or-treemap index.js nr1.json styles.scss Set up your component state Add component state to the default visualization template that nr1 created for you. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap/index.js. You'll work in here for the rest of this lesson.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type. Use SegmentedControl and SegmentedControlItem to switch between the two chart types. Tip To learn more about the components available in the New Relic One SDK, go to our Intro to New Relic One SDK.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One app catalog. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

      "info": "Build a \"Hello, World!\" app and publish it to New Relic One",
      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have accounts in GitHub and New Relic. To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in the New Relic One Catalog, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "Subscribe to a Nerdpack to use it in the New Relic platform. Unsubscribe from Nerdpacks you no longer use. Check your permissions To subscribe to a Nerdpack, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can subscribe to them: Publish your Nerdpack Tag your Nerdpack if it's published and doesn't yet have a tag Subscribe to a Nerdpack Subscribe to a published Nerdpack, with either the web UI or the nr1 CLI, to use it in your account. Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack under New Relic One catalog: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the New Relic One catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel. Tip nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:unset. Read the nr1 subscription:unset documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:unset --help Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you subscribe to a Nerdpack, you may run into issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Fetch data from a third-party service, before starting this one. In this course, you're building a New Relic One application. This application shows telemetry data from a demo service that is running an A/B test so that it can reveal that data in charts, like a dashboard. Your New Relic application is different than a dashboard, however, because it does more than show New Relic data. It pulls external data, provides UI components and functionality, and even has its own small data stores. The purpose of this New Relic application is to present context so you can better understand the A/B test results and how those results tie in to your business objectives. So far, you've built all your charts, organized them for improved usability, provided them with real data, and more. There are some final improvements you can make, using Platform API components. In this lesson, you learn how to use values in the New Relic platform state. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-platform-state-context/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, add a PlatformStateContext.Consumer to your NewsletterSignups component's render() method: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Notice that NrqlQuery uses a constant called ACCOUNT_ID. Instead of hardcoding an account identifier in your Nerdlet, you can use accountId from the platform URL state. Step 3 of 10 PlatformStateContext.Consumer provides access to the platform's URL state. This context contains an important value you'll use in your app, called timeRange. Notice that your NrqlQuery uses a SINCE clause that identifies the historical timeframe your query should fetch data from. Right now, that SINCE clause is set to 30 MINUTES AGO. With timeRange, you can use the platform's time picker to make this timeframe adjustable. Step 4 of 10 Utilize the platform state's timeRange: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, NewsletterSignups uses platformState.timeRange instead of a hardcoded SINCE clause. While NrqlQuery components accept a convenient timeRange prop, not every component does. You can still use timeRange in other contexts by accessing duration, begin_time, or end_time: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { console.log(platformState.timeRange.duration); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>; Copy Step 5 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test. Step 6 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 7 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 10 View your application: Your NrqlQuery now uses the platform state's timeRange, but your chart probably still shows the last 30 minutes. Why? Where does the timeRange in platform state come from? The time picker sits on the right side of your application's navigation bar: Change this value and see your chart update: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 9 of 10 Update VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Of all the charts in your New Relic One application, these three charts are the ones that should update with the time picker. The others, Total subscriptions per version, Total cancellations per version, Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions, Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, show total values over time. So, hardcoding their SINCE clauses to 7 DAYS AGO makes sense, as this is a reasonable time period for the purposes of this course. Step 10 of 10 While still serving your Nerdpack locally, view your NR1 app to see your charts updating with the time range you choose: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now that you're basing your queries off the platform state, some of your charts are dynamic in their time ranges. This is a great improvement because it allows you to adjust your charts to show data from any particular point in time, which is useful for tying data to business outcomes. The Platform API components offer a lot more functionality, too, including the ability to navigate the user to another place in New Relic. You'll learn how to do this in the next lesson.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorage from your nerdlet, before starting this one. Throughout this course, you're building a New Relic One application that gathers telemetry data from a demo web service that's running an A/B test on a newsletter signup form. The purpose of your New Relic One application is to help you understand how design changes impact the number of high quality newsletter subscriptions your service gets. The business objective, to increase your service's high quality newsletter subscriptions, relies primarily on three key pieces of information: Number of page views per version Number of subscriptions per version Number of cancellations Cancellations are important because if one design version of your newsletter signup form results in a high number of subscriptions but also a high number of cancellations, then those subscriptions are not as valuable. In previous lessons, you gathered data for page views and subscriptions from New Relic's database (NRDB), but you still need cancellation data. Your demo application does not report cancellation data to New Relic, so you need to fetch that data from an external source. We've provided a service at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations to return fake cancellation data for the purposes of this course. If you visit this URL in your browser, you'll see a brief message: \"Unauthorized\". This is because we created this service with a requirement that whoever requests its data must pass an Authorization header with the bearer token ABC123. So before you can request cancellation data from api.nerdsletter.net, you need to implement a few new behaviors in your application: Provide a mechanism for inputting an authorization token Persist the authorization token in a secure data store To input your authorization token, you'll use a Modal with a TextField. The secure data store you'll use is called NerdStorageVault. It's different from NerdStorage, which you used in the last lesson, because it only supports user storage and encrypts its data. Store your API token Step 1 of 3 Change to the add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 3 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, initialize state in AbTestNerdletNerdlet with a null token default: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Your Nerdlet uses this token state to manage the authorization token you'll later pass to the third-party service. However, a component's state is not a long-term solution for data management. For that, you need NerdStorageVault. Step 3 of 3 Implement a method, called storeToken(), which mutates NerdStorageVault data, and bind that method to the AbTestNerdletNerdlet instance: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy When you call storeToken() with a new token value, your Nerdlet uses NerdGraph APIs to mutate NerdStorageVault data for the api_token key. If the request to NerdGraph is successful, storeToken() updates state.token so that the new token is locally accessible. Unlike NerdStorage, which has query and mutation components for your convenience, NerdStorageVault has no components in the SDK. Instead, you have to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to interact with it Important It's important to remember that NerdStorageVault is limited to the user scope. Any other users of your New Relic One application will have their own NerdStorageVault data. This means that even other users on your account will need to enter their token separately. Query your API token Step 1 of 2 First, create methods and state to show and hide your API token prompt: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy state.hideTokenPrompt determines whether or not the prompt is visible. Now, you need a mechanism for revealing the prompt, which is hidden by default. Step 2 of 2 Query NerdStorageVault for your api_token: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, in componentDidMount(), you've queried NerdGraph for your api_token data. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that's called when your component is mounted in the component tree. This means that early in it's setup process, your application will request your api_token. If the NerdGraph query responds successfully with your token from NerdStorageVault, it sets the token in state. Otherwise, it shows the prompt so that you can enter a token. This is great for storing an initial token, but what if you enter the wrong token or the API changes? You need a way reveal the prompt on-demand. Next, you'll create the actual token prompt and a button to manually invoke the prompt. Create your token prompt Step 1 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named token-prompt.js: bash Copy $ touch token-prompt.js Step 2 of 9 In this new file, create a button that allows you to enter a new token on demand: import React from 'react'; import { Button } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenButton receives showPrompt() in its props and calls that method when its Button is clicked. Step 3 of 9 Create a token prompt using a Modal with a TextField: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenPrompt renders a Modal with a TextField, a Button, and an explanatory prompt. You use the Modal to enter your API token. It also provides basic error handling if you try to submit the form with no token value. It's important to distinguish the token in AbTestNerdletNerdlet.state and the token in ApiTokenPrompt.state. The token in your Nerdlet's state is the current token that your Nerdlet knows about. It's this token that matches what's in NerdStorageVault. The token in ApiTokenPrompt.state is a fluid value that changes as you update the text in the TextField. When you press Submit in the modal, ApiTokenPrompt submits its token to your Nerdlet's storeToken() method. Then, storeToken() mutates NerdStorageVault with the new token. You also implemented a few methods to improve the user experience: keyPress() submits the token when the RETURN key is pressed showTokenError() and hideTokenError() remind the user that they must enter a token before submitting the form Step 4 of 9 Export your components, so you can use them in your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } export { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import ApiTokenButton and ApiTokenPrompt and add them to render(): import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; import { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } from './token-prompt'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you visit your application for the first time, the prompt is automatically revealed. Enter \"ABC123\" in the TextField, as that's the token that the third-party service expects. Once you submit your token and your Nerdlet hides the prompt, click Update API token at the bottom of your New Relic One application to reveal it again: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Pass your API token to TotalCancellations Step 1 of 3 In index.js, pass the API token to TotalCancellations so you're prepared to make a request to the third-party service: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; import { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } from './token-prompt'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <TotalCancellations token={this.state.token} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 2 of 3 In total-cancellations.js, log the token to your browser console: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { lastToken: null } } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) this.setState({lastToken: this.props.token}) } } render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy Here, you've implemented another React lifecycle method, called componentDidUpdate(). Now, every time your Nerdlet's state.token changes, TotalCancellations gets a new token prop, which triggers componentDidUpdate(). In componentDidUpdate(), you check that the incoming token is not the same as the last token it knew about, which is stored in local state. If the incoming token is different, you log a message with the new token and update state.lastToken. This logic prepares your code for a future change to use your API token in a request to a third-party service. Step 3 of 3 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see the log from TotalCancellations in your browser's console: If you change your token, you'll see another log from TotalCancellations with your updated token. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now you know how to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to manage data in NerdStorageVault! Remember, use NerdStorage for your New Relic One application's non-sensitive data and NerdStorageVault for the sensitive stuff like tokens, passwords, and other secrets. As a bonus, you created a way to manage your token in NerdStorageVault from the user interface. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component for later use. Whether it's been with NrqlQuery, AccountStorageQuery, AccountStorageMutation, NerdGraphQuery, or NerdGraphMutation, you've learned several ways to interact with New Relic data in your New Relic One application. But New Relic One applications aren't just another way to show New Relic data. The purpose of New Relic One applications is to show you how your software is helping you meet your business objectives. Sometimes, New Relic data is all you need to make that happen, but other times you need to look beyond New Relic for data to fill in the gaps. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Fetch data from a third-party service.",

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: allows you to configure your Nerdlet and write to your Nerdlet's URL state.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add user interface components to your application, before starting this one. In previous hands-on lessons, you created all the charts from your design guide. Unfortunately, they aren’t laid out like they are in the design. The New Relic One SDK provides multiple solutions for organizing your components. The one you’ll learn about in this lesson is the Grid component. To arrange your charts, place them in a Grid. A Grid is a container you use to organize your content into 12-column rows. A GridItem is the building block for a Grid. You specify the columnSpan of a GridItem between 1 and 12 to determine how much of the row that the GridItem should cover. So, if you want a chart to stretch across the width of the view, you would place the chart in a GridItem with a columnSpan of 12. If you want twelve charts to fit in a single row, use a columnSpan of 1. Using the design guide as a base, you can plan how to organize your Grid: Once you’ve planned out how you’re going to arrange your columns, you can write some code to realize your plans. Step 1 of 6 Change to the add-a-grid/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import Grid and GridItem. Then, update your Nerdlet's render() method by placing each chart in a GrildItem. Finally, place all your items in a Grid: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy The columnSpan for each chart matches the layout plan. Every chart that takes up half the 12-column row has a columnSpan of 6, and every chart that takes up the whole row has a columnSpan of 12. Notice that each of the charts in the ChartGroup, but not the ChartGroup itself, is in a GridItem. A ChartGroup connects charts' behaviors, not their locations. Each chart fills its columnSpan because they use the fullWidth prop. fullWidth makes the chart fill its available horizontal space and GridItem.columnSpan restricts that space to some fraction of the row. Remove a fullWidth prop, and see how the chart reacts. Technical detail Notice the wrapper class applied to the Grid. We quietly provided some CSS styles to help make this app look great! This isn't a CSS course, so we won't cover everything we added, we'll just include the styles we intend for you to use in the code snippets. Just know that every UI component in the New Relic One SDK provides a className prop where you can provide a CSS class name. You can view the styles in nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see your charts styled and arranged in a grid. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. In just six steps, you significantly improved the readability and usability of your A/B test application, but you can take further steps to improve the usability of your charts. In the next lesson, you’ll add headings to your charts to remind yourself of what data each chart presents.

With your charts organized and descriptive headings above each one, your New Relic One application is becoming more usable. In this lesson, you'll continue that trend by creating descriptions for each design version in your A/B test. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-version-descriptions/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-version-descriptions/ab-test Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named description.js: bash Copy $ touch description.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a new React component, called VersionDescription, which uses a HeadingText and a BlockText to render a version description that you pass, using the description prop: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, HeadingText } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionDescription extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return ( <div> <HeadingText className=\"versionHeader\"> Version {this.props.version} </HeadingText> <BlockText className=\"versionText\"> {this.props.description} </BlockText> </div> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/description.js Copy You'll use this one class to create a version description for each design version in your A/B test.

You passed the description and version props, which correspond to a design version. You also added a horizontal rule to visually separate the descriptions from the charts in your app. For this, you added a GridItem with a columnSpan of 12, to stretch the rule the full width of the grid. Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-version-descriptions/ab-test.

      "body": "When building a query using the query builder, there are a variety of types of visualizations for presenting your data in the optimal format. This table contains all chart types. Whether a chart type is available for your query will be dependent on: The type of query (some query results don't match some chart types) The query mode (basic or advanced) Area chart An area chart shows a time series for a single attribute. The area chart type shows a time series for a single attribute. To enable an area chart, add a FACET to your query. Important You can add only one facet in basic mode. In advanced mode, you can use facet to add up to five attributes, separated by commas. Use the TIMESERIES function when you use a FACET in an NRQL query. Use an area chart when you want to View the measurement of a single attribute over a period of time that you specify. Avoid an area chart when you want to View a chart that contains more than a single attribute. The line chart type is a good option; you can view multiple attributes over a time range that you specify. The bar chart type gives you a comparison view between the attributes; it uses a total of each attribute for the time range you choose. Bar chart The bar chart shows comparisons among the categories returned in the query results. The bar chart compares a related set of values. To enable a bar chart, add a FACET clause to the query. Important You can add only one facet in basic mode. You can use FACET with up to 5 different attributes, separated by commas. Use a bar chart when you want to Create a chart that reports the total count of the data for a category over the specified time range. With the bar chart format, you can easily see the differences between each category. Avoid a bar chart when you want to Include measurements over a period of time. This chart type is not available when using a TIMESERIES clause. The line chart type is a good option for this visualization. Billboard The billboard chart type presents results as a single, highly-visible value. It's an option when your query returns a single number, such as from this query: SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView since 1 day ago Copy A billboard chart is useful for single-stat queries like the Apdex function. Use billboards to monitor values at a glance. Billboards can also be used to compare a single value across states. For instance, use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the same attribute across two different time frames. The billboard chart displays a single value in a large, easy to read font. To enable the data for a billboard chart, search for a single value. You can view multiple values by adding a facet from the dropdown. You can set Warning and Critical thresholds on billboards, which will highlight a chart in yellow or red. The threshold fields are on the right side of the chart edit pane, highlighted in yellow and red respectively. If you want to highlight a chart when a value falls below a given value rather than above it, set the Warning threshold higher than the Critical threshold. Tip Threshold fields will only be available for dashboards that present a single value. For instance, the use of a COMPARE WITH clause will disable the threshold settings in the edit pane. Use a billboard chart when you want to Monitor values, including thresholds for Critical and Warning states, in a large, easy-to-read font. Avoid a billboard chart type when You want to view data over a period of time. The line chart type is a better option for viewing data by time. Bullet chart Use the bullet chart type to represent progress to a target or goal, called the limit. To use this chart type, run a query that returns a single number, such as: SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The bullet chart displays a value compared against a limit. Bullet defaults to a limit that is twice the resulting query value. To adjust the limit, use the Limit field to enter another number. The bullet will adjust accordingly. Tip The bullet chart type can only be used for charts that present a single value. For example, a query using COMPARE WITH will not list bullet as an option. Use a bullet chart when you want to View a chart uses a large, easy-to-read font that helps you view the value quickly. Avoid a bullet chart when you want to View data that has more than a single value. Bar and line chart types may be better choices in this instance. Funnel Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data types that make up the steps toward a specified goal. A funnel allows you to ask, “Of the people that did (A), how many also did (B), and of the people that did (A) and (B), how many also completed (C)?” Sample funnel chart for a shopping site. In this example, you want to determine that of all the visitors that viewed the landing page, how many of them: Browsed the products. Then added one or more products to a shopping cart. And finally, purchased the item(s) in the shopping cart. Unlike other queries, you must use a SELECT funnel() statement in your query; the funnel chart type is not selectable from any other type of query. Additionally, the funnel chart type is only available for queries with eight steps or fewer. A funnel query that includes more than eight steps will only return the results as JSON. SELECT funnel(session, WHERE pageUrl like '%/index.html' AS 'Landing', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/browse/phones' AS 'Browse ', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/shoppingcart' AS 'Cart', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/checkout' AS 'Purchased') FROM PageView where appName = 'WebPortal' AND duration < 1 SINCE 1 week ago Copy Use a funnel when you want to You want to visually evaluate the paths that visitors take after they hit a page that you designate as a landing page. Avoid a funnel when you want to You only want counts for the attributes in the WHERE clause. You will not be able to choose funnel unless you use SELECT funnel in your query. Heat map The heat map displays data in a tabular format using color gradations to show frequency in specific time buckets. The heat map is a faceted distribution of values where color density represents the values displayed. To enable a heat map, use the Histogram() function with a numeric attribute and use FACET to add up to five attributes, separated by commas. See Histograms: View data distribution for more detailed information about histogram-based charts. Use a heat map when you want to View tabular data for multiple attributes over a period of time, with gradated colors instead of numerals. Avoid a heat map when you want to View the exact data for multiple attributes over a period of time. A line or bar chart may be an option. Histogram A histogram charts frequency across a series of value ranges. Use histograms to show the distribution of data across time buckets. See Histograms: View data distribution for more detailed information about histogram-based charts. Use a histogram when you want to Chart frequency of data over a series of values. Avoid a histogram when you want to View the same data as heat map or to view the data without the time buckets. JSON Use the returned JSON to review the raw data returned and to help develop integrations with New Relic. To implement integrations, use remote queries to return raw JSON as a service. To use this, select the Share menu and click Copy JSON. Example NRQL query: SELECT uniqueCount(name) FROM Transaction WHERE httpResponseCode = '200' TIMESERIES FACET appName LIMIT 10 SINCE 24 hours ago Copy Example JSON response: { \"metadata\": { \"contents\": { \"messages\": [], \"timeSeries\": { \"messages\": [], \"contents\": [ { \"function\": \"uniquecount\", \"attribute\": \"name\", \"simple\": true } ] }, \"bucketSizeMillis\": 1800000 }, \"eventTypes\": [ \"Transaction\" ], \"eventType\": \"Transaction\", \"openEnded\": true, \"messages\": [], \"beginTimeMillis\": 1556226069396, \"endTimeMillis\": 1556312469396, \"beginTime\": \"2019-04-25T21:01:09Z\", \"endTime\": \"2019-04-26T21:01:09Z\", \"guid\": \"5238a2c6-328d-a5ff-9185-7f3f04c42d1e\", \"routerGuid\": \"1aea2ec5-0be8-3a60-7554-851e1b016eb0\", \"rawSince\": \"24 HOURS AGO\", \"rawUntil\": \"NOW\", \"rawCompareWith\": \"\", \"facet\": \"appName\", \"offset\": 0, \"limit\": 10 }, \"facets\": [ { \"name\": \"RPM Combined Production\", \"beginTimeSeconds\": 0, \"endTimeSeconds\": 0, \"timeSeries\": [ { \"results\": [ { \"uniqueCount\": 415 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 1556226069, \"endTimeSeconds\": 1556227869, \"inspectedCount\": 4589471 }, [ { \"uniqueCount\": 1714 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 1556310669, \"endTimeSeconds\": 1556312469, \"inspectedCount\": 53341469 } ], \"total\": { \"results\": [ { \"uniqueCount\": 2651 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 0, \"endTimeSeconds\": 0, \"inspectedCount\": 5053841114 } }, \"performanceStats\": { \"inspectedCount\": 6088068932, \"responseTime\": 8077 } } ... Copy Line A line chart is useful for spotting trends over time. The line chart plots a timeseries for an attribute. When working in basic query mode, select a single attribute you can plot over time. When using NRQL, SELECT one or more attributes you can plot over time and then use the TIMESERIES function. Use a line chart when you want to Create a chart that lets you easily view trends over a specified time frame. Avoid a line chart when you want to View your data using one or more attributes and see the values associated with each attribute. A bar or table chart is an option. Pie chart A pie chart is the graphic representation of the table. It appears as an option for some functions when the FACET clause is used. To use this chart type, run a query that returns one value for each of a set of attributes. The pie chart maps a set of values as a portion of a whole. To enable pie chart, add a FACET from the dropdown. You can add only one FACET in basic query mode. If you're using NRQL, you can use FACET to add up to 5 attributes, separated by commas, and also include the TIMESERIES function. Pie charts are unavailable for the following aggregator functions: average, apdex, min, max, percentage, and percentile. For uniqueCount, percentages may add up to more than 100%. Use a pie chart when you want to Create a chart that that graphically presents a set of values as they relate to a whole. A pie chart is effective for displaying values for a time period, for example. Avoid a pie chart when you want to Present data that does not use values as they related to a whole, such as with line charts. Pie chart percentage problem When using a pie chart with the uniqueCount aggregator function, the percentages can add up to more than 100%. This is because the attributes being uniquely counted may be present in multiple facets. For example, in the query SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView FACET appName, a single unique user may use multiple apps. Each of these users are included in the unique value for each of the appropriate facets (apps), but the total number of unique users won't change. To solve this, use a bar chart or table to provide a more accurate visualization of uniqueCount data. Table A table is the standard view for a set of values related to a specific attribute (for example, the count of all page views by user agent name). By default, all tables are sortable by any one column. If you are using the FACET clause, the results will normally be returned as a table. Other features of tables: You can use a table as a shortcut to other dashboards. If a table is faceted by attribute, selecting an entry takes you to an existing dashboard filtered by that attribute. You can export a table chart to a CSV file. Details on this functionality: If a filter is applied to a dashboard, the download will only include the subset of data based on the filter. If a specific fixed time range is selected, the CSV includes the data for that time period. If you query with multiple attributes, the export includes columns for all FACETs in the query. For charts with a time range dependent on the present moment (for example, since 30 minutes ago), the data in the CSV is generated from the present moment, not from when the chart was initially generated. The table chart type, with its tabular format, works well for dashboards, as well as sharing the data for use in reports, for example. Use a table when you want to Create a text-compatible table consisting of your data. This table can be shared and used in reports or imported into spreadsheets, for example. Avoid a table when you want to View your data in a graphical format.",

      "body": "Once you've created a chart, you can customize the appearance of it to best present the data. You can share a chart in different formats and add a chart to a new or existing dashboard. Change the appearance of your chart When you run your query in advanced (NRQL) mode or view your chart while using basic mode to specify data, the query builder analyzes your data and applies a chart type that fits your data. For some queries, you'll have several options of chart types to choose from. To change chart type, use the Chart type menu to the right of the current chart. Each type in the list has a tooltip with information about using that type. Example of the chart type menu, showing a tooltip. Customize your charts While we try our best to optimize how we display your data, sometimes you may have other needs. To this end, you can customize charts to display information at your convenience. Tip Customizations are available depending on the chart type. Format date and time Tip For table and billboard charts. Customize the date and time format for tables and billboards: for each type of data, you can select if you want to leave it as it is, or modify the format as Numeric or Date. If data is a timestamp, you can choose how to represent the date and time: For numbers, select if you want us to auto-format them, or chose the number of decimals you want to see. Customize the Y axis Tip For line and area charts. On line charts and area charts you can adjust the Y axis to display the data within certain values by setting a minimum and maximum value for the axis. If no customization option is selected, dashboards automatically displays the full Y axis from 0 to the top value plus a margin. Enable or disable the legend Tip For line and area charts, and histograms. For line charts, area charts, and histograms, you can disable or enable the legend. Remove the other groups facet Tip For bar and pie charts, and tables. When faceting on bar charts, pie charts, or tables, and if the number of faceting on queries is larger than 2,000, the Other groups facet aggregates the rest of facets. With this customization you can select whether to see Other groups, or remove it. More chart-specific features For more chart type-specific features, see Chart types.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add version descriptions, before starting this one. In this course, you’re building an A/B test application in New Relic. The application presents a lot of data, through its charts, about the effectiveness of each design version you’re testing on your demo website. Ultimately, you’ll be able to use that data to decide which design is most effective and show that design to every user who visits your site. In this lesson, you’ll build a form into your application that lets you choose which design you want to show to every user of your site. Before writing any code, look at your design guide to review the section you’re going to build: This new section has three main components: A heading with instructional copy: \"Pick a version to end the test\" A component that you use to crown the winning version of the A/B test A button to confirm the winner that you selected Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-end-test-section/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named end-test.js: bash Copy $ touch end-test.js Step 3 of 10 In this new file, create a VersionSelector component to encapsulate a Select and its SelectItem child components: import React from 'react'; import { Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy VersionSelector renders a Select component with two choices. In each SelectItem, you specify a value prop. In this case, you use 'A' to represent version A and 'B' to represent version B. Step 4 of 10 Create another component for a Button you'll use to make your test as ended: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy This looks trivial, but it will encapsulate button logic as you iterate on your app code. Step 5 of 10 Create a final component for the entire section you'll use to mark the end of your test: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you create a Grid with three items. First, you create a GridItem that contains a HeadingText and spans all 12 columns. In the next row, you have two items: The VersionSelector component you created in the previous step A Button which reads \"End test\" These items each span one column, but instead of using columnSpan, they use a combination of columnStart and columnEnd to specify which columns they cover. Step 6 of 10 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, add EndTestSection to your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. However, you need to make a few improvements to this code. When you select a version, the selected value in the component doesn't change. You must control the value that Select displays using its value prop and onChange event handler. In the next lesson, you’ll update your code to persist your version choice in the Select component.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Persist the selected version, before starting this one. In this tutorial, you're building an A/B test application. The application surfaces data about an ongoing A/B test on your website, which you then use to decide which page design version is most effective at engaging users. As part of that overarching goal, you're building a section which allows you to end the test by deciding a winner of the experiment: Unfortunately, there are a few issues with the code and design for this section. By the end of this course, pressing End test will tell your website's backend server that every customer should see the version selected here. This is destructive behavior because it makes an irreversible change to your website. To account for the desctructiveness of pressing End test, you need to modify some features of your application: Make the button look important to catch your eye Prompt yourself with a confirmation message before ending the test to ensure you don't end it prematurely Show and hide your confirmation modal Step 1 of 12 Change to the present-confirmation-modal/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test This directory contains the code your application should have at this point in the course.

Step 3 of 12 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test. Step 4 of 12 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 12 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 12 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: Now you've styled your button to convey its destructive consequences, but that's not enough to prevent you from accidentally clicking it. Next, you create a shield for your website's backend. This extra layer of protection requires you to confirm that you intend to end the test before actually doing so. Step 7 of 12 Add a Modal to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Your new modal contains a heading, a confirmation message, the winning design version, and two buttons. You'll explore some of these components later in this course. With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your new Modal: Tip Remember, while your server is running, it will update automatically when you save your code. The modal looks great, but it has three issues: It was present before you clicked End test You can't dismiss it It always says you selected \"Version A\", even if you didn't In the following steps, you'll correct all three of these issues. Step 8 of 12 In EndTestButton, initialize state with a value for modalHidden: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy modalHidden determines whether or not to hide the modal. The default value of modalHidden is true because you only want to show the modal when you select End test. Step 9 of 12 Supply modalHidden to the Modal: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy First, you've created a constructor to accept component props. This provides your component access to the modalHidden prop that you passed in EndTestSection. Then you provide the value of modalHidden to the Modal component's hidden prop. Tip Read more about Modal and its props on the New Relic developer site. Step 10 of 12 Add and bind two new methods to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Use closeModal and showModal to close and show your modal, respectively, depending on how a user interacts with the modal. Step 11 of 12 Show the modal when you click End test: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you've supplied showModal() as the callback for the Button component's onClick event. Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. The modal is hidden by default. Click End test to see the modal. Step 12 of 12 Close the modal from the Modal component's onClose callback and from the Yes, end test and No, continue test buttons: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Click End test. The modal opens and displays your confirmation message. Close the modal by clicking X at the top right, either of its buttons, or even in the dark space to its left. Notice that the modal says you chose \"Version A\", even if you choose \"Version B\". This is because \"Version A\" is hardcoded in the Modal text. Next, you'll make that dynamic. Use the version you selected in your modal Step 1 of 2 In EndTestSection, pass selectedVersion to the EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Now, you can access the selected version from the EndTestButton component's props. Step 2 of 2 Use selectedVersion in your confirmation message: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Select \"Version B\" from the menu. Click End test to see \"Version B\" in the confirmation modal: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Congratulations! You've done a lot of work and it shows in the usefulness of your application. You've created charts that show mocked data. You've organized your charts into a readable structure. You've added an interface for your users to interact with the test. Now, you need some real data. In the next lesson, you'll replace the mocked data in your charts with real data from your backend service.

      "body": "With the data explorer you can navigate all your data visually, without any NRQL knowledge. Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Tip To use the data explorer and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces apps to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From data explorer you can access query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize NRQL data, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { this[index] = { endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, } }, data ) historicalData.data = data return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data, format it according to the TableChart specifications, and set it on historicalData.data. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you learned of a third-party service that you can use to fetch mock cancellation data for the Total cancellations per version chart in your New Relic One application. Even though the data in this service is fake, the real value of this lesson is learning how you can use third party services to supply data to your New Relic One application. If you make a request to the mock service with cancellation data (https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations) you'll see a response rejecting your request with a message that reads \"Unauthorized\": bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations Unauthorized This is because the Nerdsletter API requires an Authorization header. More specifically, you must pass a bearer token of ABC123 to gain authorized access to its data. If you make a request to the service with the header Authorization: Bearer ABC123, you'll get a successful response with the mocked cancellation data: bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations -H 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' {\"a\": 15, \"b\": 78} In the last lesson, you used NerdGraph to store this API token in your New Relic One application's NerdStorageVault data store. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component and logged its use to your browser's console. In this lesson, you follow up that log statement with a real request to the Nerdsletter API using your authorization token. Then, you supply the data from that external resource to your Total cancellations per version chart. Step 1 of 6 Change to the third-party-services/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/third-party-services/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 6 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js, make a request to api.nerdsletter.net with your API token. Save the results to state, and use that state in render(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { cancellations: [], lastToken: null } } generateChartData(data) { const cancellationsA = data ? data.a : 0; const cancellationsB = data ? data.b : 0; return [ { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsA }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsB }, ], }, ] } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`Requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) fetch( \"https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations\", {headers: {\"Authorization\": `Bearer ${this.props.token}`}} ).then( (response) => { if (response.status == 200) { return response.json() } else if (response.status == 401) { console.error(\"Incorrect auth header\") } else { console.error(response.text()) } } ).then( (data) => { if (data) { this.setState({ cancellations: this.generateChartData(data), lastToken: this.props.token }) } } ) } } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={this.state.cancellations} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy In this code, you initialize TotalCancellations.state.cancellations with zero for the y-value in each series instead of the previously hardcoded values. This helps to more realistically represent what the chart should show if your New Relic One app hasn't successfully requested data from the Nerdsletter API. Next, you use Javascript's fetch() function to make an HTTP request to the Nerdsletter API. You then pass your token in the request's Authorization header. If the request is successful, you update the cancellation data in TotalCancellations.state so that that data is reflected in the component's render method. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/third-party-service/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. If your token in NerdStorageVault is not \"ABC123\", then your console will show an error that reads, \"Incorrect auth header\": If you set the token to \"ABC123\", then Total cancellations per version updates to show the values from the third-party service: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great job! You've come a long way from running nr1 nerdpack:create for the first time. Take a look back at your design guide to see that your application now has everything from an interface and data perspective that you planned from the beginning: You've created eight charts with varying styles and supplied them with dynamic data from multiple sources. You've learned about the New Relic One SDK and used many of its components. You've even gathered data from a third-party service and mixed it seemlessly with your New Relic data to provide a complete look at how the competing versions in your A/B test perform against each other. From here, there is only one more set of APIs in the New Relic One SDK that you've yet to get your hands on: Platform APIs. These will come in handy in improving the usability of your New Relic One application.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize NRQL data, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { this[index] = { endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, } }, data ) historicalData.data = data return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data, format it according to the TableChart specifications, and set it on historicalData.data. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorageVault to store data in an encrypted storage solution. Using NerdStorageVault in your apps NerdStorageVault is used to store and retrieve sensitive secrets data such as: personal access tokens license keys API keys other third party secrets Tip NerdStorageVault is encrypted with AES-256 encryption Usage considerations This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorageVault can currently only be used within the context of a Nerdpack. You cannot make a direct query or mutation to NerdStorageVault. You can explore the fields and response types via the NerdGraph API explorer. The only supported scope is ACTOR, or data that relates to a particular user. Component library Currently NerdStorageVault is available in the alpha release of Nr1 Community component library and is not available in the Nr1 core components library. Open source components can be use to augment Nr1 core components for additional functionality. NerdGraph queries Below are examples of the queries used by the components to interact with NerdStorageVault. Tip NerdStorageVault can currently only be used within the context of a Nerdpack. Write mutation { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: \"test\", value: \"secret_test\" } ) { status errors { message type } } } Copy Delete mutation { nerdStorageVaultDeleteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } key: \"test_key\" ) { status errors { message type } } } Copy Fetch a single secret query { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: \"test_key\") { key value } } } } Copy Fetch a list of secrets query { actor { nerdStorageVault { secrets { key value } } } } Copy Limits A maximum of 10 secrets can be stored per ACTOR. A secret value is limited to 5000 characters. A key value is limited to 64 characters.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add a grid, before starting this one. Organizing charts is one way to clarify the information you're trying to convey to your users. Headings are another. Since you have several charts on the same page, use headings to describe the information they show. To remember what data each chart presents, consult your design guide: The design guide details what data each chart shows. Use those details to craft useful headings for your charts. Step 1 of 6 Change to the add-chart-headings/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-chart-headings/ab-test Step 2 of 6 In newsletter-signups.js, page-views.js, past-tests.js, total-cancellations.js, total-subscriptions.js, and totals.js, import HeadingText and add a descriptive heading above the chart in each of your custom components: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } const versionBSignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-b-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 20 }, { x: 10, y: 5 }, { x: 20, y: 25 }, { x: 30, y: 45 }, { x: 40, y: 50 }, { x: 50, y: 35 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionASignups, versionBSignups]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [ { \"endDate\": \"12-15-2020\", \"versionADescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was green.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was blue.\", \"winner\": \"A\" }, { \"endDate\": \"09-06-2019\", \"versionADescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a carousel.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a grid.\", \"winner\": \"B\" } ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { const versionATotals = { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[versionATotals]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Notice the new <div> tag in each render(), which allows you to return multiple elements at once. Also, remember that we provided you a CSS stylesheet that styles the chartHeader class. You can look at nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss to see more. You don't need to modify your Nerdlet's render() method in index.js because your components encapsulate the new code. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see that your charts have descriptive headings. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Well done! You've created all the charts that are laid out in your design guide. You’ve also organized them into a neat grid and added headings so that the charts are intelligible. While chart headings helps you understand what each chart shows, it'd be nice to add descriptions to help you remember what each version in your A/B test represents. In the next lesson, you'll add a description for each design version. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Add version descriptions.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add version descriptions, before starting this one. In this course, you’re building an A/B test application in New Relic. The application presents a lot of data, through its charts, about the effectiveness of each design version you’re testing on your demo website. Ultimately, you’ll be able to use that data to decide which design is most effective and show that design to every user who visits your site. In this lesson, you’ll build a form into your application that lets you choose which design you want to show to every user of your site. Before writing any code, look at your design guide to review the section you’re going to build: This new section has three main components: A heading with instructional copy: \"Pick a version to end the test\" A component that you use to crown the winning version of the A/B test A button to confirm the winner that you selected Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-end-test-section/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named end-test.js: bash Copy $ touch end-test.js Step 3 of 10 In this new file, create a VersionSelector component to encapsulate a Select and its SelectItem child components: import React from 'react'; import { Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy VersionSelector renders a Select component with two choices. In each SelectItem, you specify a value prop. In this case, you use 'A' to represent version A and 'B' to represent version B. Step 4 of 10 Create another component for a Button you'll use to make your test as ended: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy This looks trivial, but it will encapsulate button logic as you iterate on your app code. Step 5 of 10 Create a final component for the entire section you'll use to mark the end of your test: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you create a Grid with three items. First, you create a GridItem that contains a HeadingText and spans all 12 columns. In the next row, you have two items: The VersionSelector component you created in the previous step A Button which reads \"End test\" These items each span one column, but instead of using columnSpan, they use a combination of columnStart and columnEnd to specify which columns they cover. Step 6 of 10 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, add EndTestSection to your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. However, you need to make a few improvements to this code. When you select a version, the selected value in the component doesn't change. You must control the value that Select displays using its value prop and onChange event handler. In the next lesson, you’ll update your code to persist your version choice in the Select component. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Persist the selected version.",

      "info": "Build a \"Hello, World!\" app and publish it to New Relic One",
      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have accounts in GitHub and New Relic. To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in the New Relic One Catalog, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you learned of a third-party service that you can use to fetch mock cancellation data for the Total cancellations per version chart in your New Relic One application. Even though the data in this service is fake, the real value of this lesson is learning how you can use third party services to supply data to your New Relic One application. If you make a request to the mock service with cancellation data (https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations) you'll see a response rejecting your request with a message that reads \"Unauthorized\": bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations Unauthorized This is because the Nerdsletter API requires an Authorization header. More specifically, you must pass a bearer token of ABC123 to gain authorized access to its data. If you make a request to the service with the header Authorization: Bearer ABC123, you'll get a successful response with the mocked cancellation data: bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations -H 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' {\"a\": 15, \"b\": 78} In the last lesson, you used NerdGraph to store this API token in your New Relic One application's NerdStorageVault data store. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component and logged its use to your browser's console. In this lesson, you follow up that log statement with a real request to the Nerdsletter API using your authorization token. Then, you supply the data from that external resource to your Total cancellations per version chart. Step 1 of 6 Change to the third-party-services/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/third-party-services/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 6 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js, make a request to api.nerdsletter.net with your API token. Save the results to state, and use that state in render(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { cancellations: [], lastToken: null } } generateChartData(data) { const cancellationsA = data ? data.a : 0; const cancellationsB = data ? data.b : 0; return [ { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsA }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsB }, ], }, ] } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`Requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) fetch( \"https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations\", {headers: {\"Authorization\": `Bearer ${this.props.token}`}} ).then( (response) => { if (response.status == 200) { return response.json() } else if (response.status == 401) { console.error(\"Incorrect auth header\") } else { console.error(response.text()) } } ).then( (data) => { if (data) { this.setState({ cancellations: this.generateChartData(data), lastToken: this.props.token }) } } ) } } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={this.state.cancellations} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy In this code, you initialize TotalCancellations.state.cancellations with zero for the y-value in each series instead of the previously hardcoded values. This helps to more realistically represent what the chart should show if your New Relic One app hasn't successfully requested data from the Nerdsletter API. Next, you use Javascript's fetch() function to make an HTTP request to the Nerdsletter API. You then pass your token in the request's Authorization header. If the request is successful, you update the cancellation data in TotalCancellations.state so that that data is reflected in the component's render method. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/third-party-service/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. If your token in NerdStorageVault is not \"ABC123\", then your console will show an error that reads, \"Incorrect auth header\": If you set the token to \"ABC123\", then Total cancellations per version updates to show the values from the third-party service: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great job! You've come a long way from running nr1 nerdpack:create for the first time. Take a look back at your design guide to see that your application now has everything from an interface and data perspective that you planned from the beginning: You've created eight charts with varying styles and supplied them with dynamic data from multiple sources. You've learned about the New Relic One SDK and used many of its components. You've even gathered data from a third-party service and mixed it seemlessly with your New Relic data to provide a complete look at how the competing versions in your A/B test perform against each other. From here, there is only one more set of APIs in the New Relic One SDK that you've yet to get your hands on: Platform APIs. These will come in handy in improving the usability of your New Relic One application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add NrqlQuery components to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In this series, you're creating a New Relic One application, or NR1 app for short, that shows A/B test data in a variety of charts. Most of the charts need to show data that comes from a demo service you spun up at the beginning of this series. To refresh your memory on what you're building, review your design guide: In the last lesson, you supplied real data, which comes from New Relic's database, to the following charts: Newsletter subscriptions per version Version A - Page views Version B - Page views Total subscriptions per version Because you have experience querying subscription and page view data, you may feel ready to supply data to even more charts: Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions However, these charts are different than the charts you've supplied data to because they compare data from two different sources: subscription events and pageView events. In this lesson, you learn how to format data from multiple sources to exist in the same chart. Experiment with data in the Data explorer Step 1 of 6 From your New Relic homepage's top navigation menu, go to to the Data explorer: Here, you can experiment with subscription event and pageView event queries to make sure you fetch the right data in your app. Step 2 of 6 Select subscription from the Custom events menu: This queries NRDB for subscription event totals per minute over the last 30 minutes and shows that data in a chart: Step 3 of 6 Click Dimensions to see a list of the attributes associated with these subscription events: You can filter and group subscription events using these dimensions. For Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, you want to filter your subscription totals by page_version. Step 4 of 6 Click the NRQL query to navigate to the Query builder: Here, you can view and manually edit the query to fetch the data you need. Step 5 of 6 Add a WHERE clause to filter subscription totals by page_version: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Remove the TIMESERIES clause to fetch a count: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO Copy Modify the SINCE clause to see totals over the past week: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO Copy Click Run and see the data visualized in a billboard chart instead of a line chart: Step 6 of 6 Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions need a combined total of four data values: All-time subscription totals for version A All-time page view totals for version A All-time subscription totals for version B All-time page view totals for version B Experiment with the Query builder to discover the four queries which pull the right data. In the end, you'll come up with the following four queries: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'b' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = 'b' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO Copy technical detail Unlike other structured query languages, NRQL doesn't provide a mechanism for joining data across sources. This is why you have to perform two queries to get subscription event totals and pageView event totals. Until now, you've provided every chart with a single query. Here, you have to provide two queries per chart. In the remaining steps, you'll learn how to customize NrqlQuery results to merge data from multiple sources. Merge NRQL from multiple sources Step 1 of 9 Change to the customize-nrql-data/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/customize-nrql-data/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 9 In your Nerdlet's totals.js file, implement constructor() and the React lifecycle method componentDidMount() in VersionTotals: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { tableData: { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } } } componentDidMount() { NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[0].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[1].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[this.state.tableData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Here, you initialize your state in the component's constructor. The state has a single value, tableData, which holds series data and metadata for the TableChart. In componentDidMount(), you query the data that populates the data in this state. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that is called when a component is mounted in the component tree. You use this method, instead of the constructor, to query data because your logic, which requests data from New Relic, introduces side effects and sets state values, neither of which you should do in the constructor. In componentDidMount(), you use NrqlQuery in a new way. First, you specified the formatType to NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW because you're going to modify the data instead of supplying it directly to a chart Before, you used its JSX form in the render() method of a chart. Second, you called its query() method and handled the results in a then() callback, which logs them to the console. Step 3 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, create a constant called ACCOUNT_ID and pass it to VersionTotals: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/ Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 4 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/customize-nrql-data/ab-test. Step 5 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 6 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Navigate to your app in New Relic. Step 7 of 9 To view your logs, which are useful for uncovering errors in your application, turn on developer tools in your favorite browser and navigate to the Console: FireFox instructions Safari instructions Chrome instructions With your app on-screen, notice the NRQL data in the console: This console log tells you that you can find the data you're looking for, namely the subscription or pageView count, at data.raw.results[0].count. The next step is to store that count in state.tableData. Tip If something doesn't work, use these debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 8 of 9 In totals.js, store the query data in state: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { tableData: { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } } } componentDidMount() { NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[0].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[1].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[this.state.tableData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Pay close attention to the data you're accessing. The array indices are particularly important to get right. The subscription data should go to state.tableData.data[0].count because in tableData, it is the first element in the data array: data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], Copy By similar logic, page view data should go to state.tableData.data[1].count. Step 9 of 9 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID In this lesson, you learned how to use NrqlQuery.query() to fetch data from multiple sources and stitch them together into data your chart can use. Notice that there are still two charts in your NR1 application that use mock data: Total unsubscriptions per version Past tests Unfortunately, your demo application doesn't create custom New Relic events when a user unsubscribes from your newsletter or you end an A/B test. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to populate Past tests.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorage from your nerdlet, before starting this one. Throughout this course, you're building a New Relic One application that gathers telemetry data from a demo web service that's running an A/B test on a newsletter signup form. The purpose of your New Relic One application is to help you understand how design changes impact the number of high quality newsletter subscriptions your service gets. The business objective, to increase your service's high quality newsletter subscriptions, relies primarily on three key pieces of information: Number of page views per version Number of subscriptions per version Number of cancellations Cancellations are important because if one design version of your newsletter signup form results in a high number of subscriptions but also a high number of cancellations, then those subscriptions are not as valuable. In previous lessons, you gathered data for page views and subscriptions from New Relic's database (NRDB), but you still need cancellation data. Your demo application does not report cancellation data to New Relic, so you need to fetch that data from an external source. We've provided a service at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations to return fake cancellation data for the purposes of this course. If you visit this URL in your browser, you'll see a brief message: \"Unauthorized\". This is because we created this service with a requirement that whoever requests its data must pass an Authorization header with the bearer token ABC123. So before you can request cancellation data from api.nerdsletter.net, you need to implement a few new behaviors in your application: Provide a mechanism for inputting an authorization token Persist the authorization token in a secure data store To input your authorization token, you'll use a Modal with a TextField. The secure data store you'll use is called NerdStorageVault. It's different from NerdStorage, which you used in the last lesson, because it only supports user storage and encrypts its data. Store your API token Step 1 of 3 Change to the add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 3 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, initialize state in AbTestNerdletNerdlet with a null token default: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Your Nerdlet uses this token state to manage the authorization token you'll later pass to the third-party service. However, a component's state is not a long-term solution for data management. For that, you need NerdStorageVault. Step 3 of 3 Implement a method, called storeToken(), which mutates NerdStorageVault data, and bind that method to the AbTestNerdletNerdlet instance: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy When you call storeToken() with a new token value, your Nerdlet uses NerdGraph APIs to mutate NerdStorageVault data for the api_token key. If the request to NerdGraph is successful, storeToken() updates state.token so that the new token is locally accessible. Unlike NerdStorage, which has query and mutation components for your convenience, NerdStorageVault has no components in the SDK. Instead, you have to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to interact with it Important It's important to remember that NerdStorageVault is limited to the user scope. Any other users of your New Relic One application will have their own NerdStorageVault data. This means that even other users on your account will need to enter their token separately. Query your API token Step 1 of 2 First, create methods and state to show and hide your API token prompt: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy state.hideTokenPrompt determines whether or not the prompt is visible. Now, you need a mechanism for revealing the prompt, which is hidden by default. Step 2 of 2 Query NerdStorageVault for your api_token: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, in componentDidMount(), you've queried NerdGraph for your api_token data. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that's called when your component is mounted in the component tree. This means that early in it's setup process, your application will request your api_token. If the NerdGraph query responds successfully with your token from NerdStorageVault, it sets the token in state. Otherwise, it shows the prompt so that you can enter a token. This is great for storing an initial token, but what if you enter the wrong token or the API changes? You need a way reveal the prompt on-demand. Next, you'll create the actual token prompt and a button to manually invoke the prompt. Create your token prompt Step 1 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named token-prompt.js: bash Copy $ touch token-prompt.js Step 2 of 9 In this new file, create a button that allows you to enter a new token on demand: import React from 'react'; import { Button } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenButton receives showPrompt() in its props and calls that method when its Button is clicked. Step 3 of 9 Create a token prompt using a Modal with a TextField: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenPrompt renders a Modal with a TextField, a Button, and an explanatory prompt. You use the Modal to enter your API token. It also provides basic error handling if you try to submit the form with no token value. It's important to distinguish the token in AbTestNerdletNerdlet.state and the token in ApiTokenPrompt.state. The token in your Nerdlet's state is the current token that your Nerdlet knows about. It's this token that matches what's in NerdStorageVault. The token in ApiTokenPrompt.state is a fluid value that changes as you update the text in the TextField. When you press Submit in the modal, ApiTokenPrompt submits its token to your Nerdlet's storeToken() method. Then, storeToken() mutates NerdStorageVault with the new token. You also implemented a few methods to improve the user experience: keyPress() submits the token when the RETURN key is pressed showTokenError() and hideTokenError() remind the user that they must enter a token before submitting the form Step 4 of 9 Export your components, so you can use them in your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } export { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import ApiTokenButton and ApiTokenPrompt and add them to render(): import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; import { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } from './token-prompt'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you visit your application for the first time, the prompt is automatically revealed. Enter \"ABC123\" in the TextField, as that's the token that the third-party service expects. Once you submit your token and your Nerdlet hides the prompt, click Update API token at the bottom of your New Relic One application to reveal it again: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Pass your API token to TotalCancellations Step 1 of 3 In index.js, pass the API token to TotalCancellations so you're prepared to make a request to the third-party service: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests';

const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } );

} } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <TotalCancellations token={this.state.token} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 2 of 3 In total-cancellations.js, log the token to your browser console: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { lastToken: null } } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) this.setState({lastToken: this.props.token}) } } render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy Here, you've implemented another React lifecycle method, called componentDidUpdate(). Now, every time your Nerdlet's state.token changes, TotalCancellations gets a new token prop, which triggers componentDidUpdate(). In componentDidUpdate(), you check that the incoming token is not the same as the last token it knew about, which is stored in local state. If the incoming token is different, you log a message with the new token and update state.lastToken. This logic prepares your code for a future change to use your API token in a request to a third-party service. Step 3 of 3 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see the log from TotalCancellations in your browser's console: If you change your token, you'll see another log from TotalCancellations with your updated token. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now you know how to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to manage data in NerdStorageVault! Remember, use NerdStorage for your New Relic One application's non-sensitive data and NerdStorageVault for the sensitive stuff like tokens, passwords, and other secrets. As a bonus, you created a way to manage your token in NerdStorageVault from the user interface. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component for later use. Whether it's been with NrqlQuery, AccountStorageQuery, AccountStorageMutation, NerdGraphQuery, or NerdGraphMutation, you've learned several ways to interact with New Relic data in your New Relic One application. But New Relic One applications aren't just another way to show New Relic data. The purpose of New Relic One applications is to show you how your software is helping you meet your business objectives. Sometimes, New Relic data is all you need to make that happen, but other times you need to look beyond New Relic for data to fill in the gaps.

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: allows you to configure your Nerdlet and write to your Nerdlet's URL state.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the New Relic One catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in the catalog Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the New Relic One app catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Apps: From here, you can see your application under New Relic One catalog: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots... ✔ Screenshots uploaded ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release! Includes: - A variety of charts for understanding the test r... whatsNew.version: 1.0.0 All the information from catalog shows here. Step 3 of 3 View your app in the catalog: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public New Relic One catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Subscribe to your New Relic One application.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you used PlatformStateContext from the New Relic One SDK to look up the time range that the user selected from the app's time picker. Now, you'll learn about another component that interacts with the New Relic platform: navigation. The navigation component lets you open entities, navigate to entities, and build Location objects for entities from your Nerdlet. You can also use navigation for other Nerdlets and launchers. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-navigation/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In newsletter-signups.js, create a new method, called NewsletterSignups.openApmEntity(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. This method uses navigation.openStackedEntity() to display your demo application's APM entity in a stacked view. Notice openApmEntity() requires your ENTITY_GUID. You need to locate that ID and store it in a constant. Step 3 of 10 Navigate to APM: See metadata for your Newsletter service: Copy the entity's GUID: Create an ENTITY_GUID constant: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and the entity GUID you just copied, respectively. Now, openApmEntity() knows what entity to show. Next, you need to create a button to invoke this method. Step 4 of 10 Create a button to show your APM entity: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you've created a button and configured it to call openApmEntity() when it's clicked. Step 5 of 10 Import Stack and StackItem: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. You'll use Stack and StackItem to lay out the button on the far right side of the same row that the HeadingText is on. Step 6 of 10 Lay out the Stack: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <Stack fullWidth> <StackItem grow={true}> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> </StackItem> <StackItem> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> </StackItem> </Stack> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you used a full-width Stack to set up the layout for the row. To make the HeadingText fill the entire row except the width of the button, you used the StackItem.grow prop. Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. Click App performance: Now you see the stacked entity: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively Congratulations! You're finished writing all the code you'll write for your New Relic One A/B test application. Now, you have an application reporting New Relic data from your demo service that is running an A/B test. You've created several charts, buttons, and other UI elements. And you've organized your components into a readable and usable view. On top of the visuals, you've supplied data to your charts from multiple data sources in and outside of New Relic. You've created some backend functionality which utilizes your New Relic One application's own data store. You've also utilized the platform APIs for interacting with platform UI and showing a stacked entity view. You've really accomplished a lot throughout this course, so far. There are only a few things left to do! First, is to learn how to publish and subscribe to your New Relic One application so that it can run on our platform instead of your own local server. Second, is to learn how to deal with some common issues you might see in New Relic One application development. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Describe your app for the catalog.",

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have accounts in GitHub and New Relic. To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in the New Relic One Catalog, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

If an application is organized, it is more readable and more understandable. In your A/B test application, you have a lot of charts, but no organization. In the next few lessons, you’ll use user interface components to bring some organization to your application and provide new functionality. First, you’ll use a Grid component to arrange your charts to match the layout in your design guide. Second, you’ll add headings to clarify what each chart represents. Third, you'll add descriptions for your A and B design versions to the top of your app. Finally, you’ll create a section for ending your A/B test. Before you add user any UI components to your application, remind yourself of how your application will look when you finish: In the next lesson, you arrange your charts to look like they do in your design guide.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add pie charts, before starting this one. In each hands-on lesson in this course, you have been adding something new to your A/B test application. You’ve spun up a new launcher and added multiple chart components to your Nerdlet. In this lesson, you’ll create two new TableChart components that display information about each version of your website, such as the ratio of customers who subscribe to those who unsubscribe. Review your design guide to understand where these tables will fit into your application: In this design guide, the TableChart components come after the pie charts you created in the last lesson. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-tables/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-tables/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named totals.js: bash Copy $ touch totals.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a component called VersionTotals to hold your first TableChart and some mock data: import React from 'react'; import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { const versionATotals = { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } return <TableChart data={[versionATotals]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy TableChart is different from PieChart and LineChart in three big ways. First of all, there are no color or viz metadata attributes in its series. TableChart has a standard visualization, so it ignores things like color, which don't apply. Second, the TableChart series have columns metadata attributes. columns determines the names of the columns on the table. Finally, TableChart series data use neither x nor y values. Instead, they use keys that match the table column and values that determine what goes into the row. Notice that VersionTotals takes a version prop and supplies it to the chart metadata's id and name fields. This allows you to use this same component to create a table for version A and B and eliminate duplicate code. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-tables/ab-test. Step 6 of 8 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 7 of 8 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the TableChart components displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Extra credit There is one more table in the design guide that records past tests. The columns for this table are: End Date: The end date for the test Version A Description: A description for version A Version B Description: A description for version B Winner: The version selected as the final design Try to build this table in your application with these column names and some fake data, without looking at a code sample. This practice will reinforce what you've learned in this lesson. If you need help, review the add-a-chart-group directory of the coursework repository, which corresponds to the next lesson in this course. This has the code for the PastTests component. Each chart you’ll add to your application throughout this course is unique in its type or in the data it presents. So far, you’ve created tables, pie charts, and a line chart, and they all function independently of one another. In the next lesson, you’ll create a couple more line charts, but this time they’ll function together. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. When you're ready, continue on to the next lesson: Add a chart group.",

      "body": "With the data explorer you can navigate all your data visually, without any NRQL knowledge. Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Tip To use the data explorer and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces apps to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From data explorer you can access query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and account/user structure. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub.

You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder.

Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules.

      "body": "When building a query using the query builder, there are a variety of types of visualizations for presenting your data in the optimal format. This table contains all chart types. Whether a chart type is available for your query will be dependent on: The type of query (some query results don't match some chart types) The query mode (basic or advanced) Area chart An area chart shows a time series for a single attribute. The area chart type shows a time series for a single attribute. To enable an area chart, add a FACET to your query. Important You can add only one facet in basic mode. In advanced mode, you can use facet to add up to five attributes, separated by commas. Use the TIMESERIES function when you use a FACET in an NRQL query. Use an area chart when you want to View the measurement of a single attribute over a period of time that you specify. Avoid an area chart when you want to View a chart that contains more than a single attribute. The line chart type is a good option; you can view multiple attributes over a time range that you specify. The bar chart type gives you a comparison view between the attributes; it uses a total of each attribute for the time range you choose. Bar chart The bar chart shows comparisons among the categories returned in the query results. The bar chart compares a related set of values. To enable a bar chart, add a FACET clause to the query. Important You can add only one facet in basic mode. You can use FACET with up to 5 different attributes, separated by commas. Use a bar chart when you want to Create a chart that reports the total count of the data for a category over the specified time range. With the bar chart format, you can easily see the differences between each category. Avoid a bar chart when you want to Include measurements over a period of time. This chart type is not available when using a TIMESERIES clause. The line chart type is a good option for this visualization. Billboard The billboard chart type presents results as a single, highly-visible value. It's an option when your query returns a single number, such as from this query: SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView since 1 day ago Copy A billboard chart is useful for single-stat queries like the Apdex function. Use billboards to monitor values at a glance. Billboards can also be used to compare a single value across states. For instance, use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the same attribute across two different time frames. The billboard chart displays a single value in a large, easy to read font. To enable the data for a billboard chart, search for a single value. You can view multiple values by adding a facet from the dropdown. You can set Warning and Critical thresholds on billboards, which will highlight a chart in yellow or red. The threshold fields are on the right side of the chart edit pane, highlighted in yellow and red respectively. If you want to highlight a chart when a value falls below a given value rather than above it, set the Warning threshold higher than the Critical threshold. Tip Threshold fields will only be available for dashboards that present a single value. For instance, the use of a COMPARE WITH clause will disable the threshold settings in the edit pane. Use a billboard chart when you want to Monitor values, including thresholds for Critical and Warning states, in a large, easy-to-read font. Avoid a billboard chart type when You want to view data over a period of time. The line chart type is a better option for viewing data by time. Bullet chart Use the bullet chart type to represent progress to a target or goal, called the limit. To use this chart type, run a query that returns a single number, such as: SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The bullet chart displays a value compared against a limit. Bullet defaults to a limit that is twice the resulting query value. To adjust the limit, use the Limit field to enter another number. The bullet will adjust accordingly. Tip The bullet chart type can only be used for charts that present a single value. For example, a query using COMPARE WITH will not list bullet as an option. Use a bullet chart when you want to View a chart uses a large, easy-to-read font that helps you view the value quickly. Avoid a bullet chart when you want to View data that has more than a single value. Bar and line chart types may be better choices in this instance. Funnel Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data types that make up the steps toward a specified goal. A funnel allows you to ask, “Of the people that did (A), how many also did (B), and of the people that did (A) and (B), how many also completed (C)?” Sample funnel chart for a shopping site. In this example, you want to determine that of all the visitors that viewed the landing page, how many of them: Browsed the products. Then added one or more products to a shopping cart. And finally, purchased the item(s) in the shopping cart. Unlike other queries, you must use a SELECT funnel() statement in your query; the funnel chart type is not selectable from any other type of query. Additionally, the funnel chart type is only available for queries with eight steps or fewer. A funnel query that includes more than eight steps will only return the results as JSON. SELECT funnel(session, WHERE pageUrl like '%/index.html' AS 'Landing', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/browse/phones' AS 'Browse ', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/shoppingcart' AS 'Cart', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/checkout' AS 'Purchased') FROM PageView where appName = 'WebPortal' AND duration < 1 SINCE 1 week ago Copy Use a funnel when you want to You want to visually evaluate the paths that visitors take after they hit a page that you designate as a landing page. Avoid a funnel when you want to You only want counts for the attributes in the WHERE clause. You will not be able to choose funnel unless you use SELECT funnel in your query. Heat map The heat map displays data in a tabular format using color gradations to show frequency in specific time buckets. The heat map is a faceted distribution of values where color density represents the values displayed. To enable a heat map, use the Histogram() function with a numeric attribute and use FACET to add up to five attributes, separated by commas. See Histograms: View data distribution for more detailed information about histogram-based charts. Use a heat map when you want to View tabular data for multiple attributes over a period of time, with gradated colors instead of numerals. Avoid a heat map when you want to View the exact data for multiple attributes over a period of time. A line or bar chart may be an option. Histogram A histogram charts frequency across a series of value ranges. Use histograms to show the distribution of data across time buckets. See Histograms: View data distribution for more detailed information about histogram-based charts. Use a histogram when you want to Chart frequency of data over a series of values. Avoid a histogram when you want to View the same data as heat map or to view the data without the time buckets. JSON Use the returned JSON to review the raw data returned and to help develop integrations with New Relic. To implement integrations, use remote queries to return raw JSON as a service. To use this, select the Share menu and click Copy JSON. Example NRQL query: SELECT uniqueCount(name) FROM Transaction WHERE httpResponseCode = '200' TIMESERIES FACET appName LIMIT 10 SINCE 24 hours ago Copy Example JSON response: { \"metadata\": { \"contents\": { \"messages\": [], \"timeSeries\": { \"messages\": [], \"contents\": [ { \"function\": \"uniquecount\", \"attribute\": \"name\", \"simple\": true } ] }, \"bucketSizeMillis\": 1800000 }, \"eventTypes\": [ \"Transaction\" ], \"eventType\": \"Transaction\", \"openEnded\": true, \"messages\": [], \"beginTimeMillis\": 1556226069396, \"endTimeMillis\": 1556312469396, \"beginTime\": \"2019-04-25T21:01:09Z\", \"endTime\": \"2019-04-26T21:01:09Z\", \"guid\": \"5238a2c6-328d-a5ff-9185-7f3f04c42d1e\", \"routerGuid\": \"1aea2ec5-0be8-3a60-7554-851e1b016eb0\", \"rawSince\": \"24 HOURS AGO\", \"rawUntil\": \"NOW\", \"rawCompareWith\": \"\", \"facet\": \"appName\", \"offset\": 0, \"limit\": 10 }, \"facets\": [ { \"name\": \"RPM Combined Production\", \"beginTimeSeconds\": 0, \"endTimeSeconds\": 0, \"timeSeries\": [ { \"results\": [ { \"uniqueCount\": 415 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 1556226069, \"endTimeSeconds\": 1556227869, \"inspectedCount\": 4589471 }, [ { \"uniqueCount\": 1714 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 1556310669, \"endTimeSeconds\": 1556312469, \"inspectedCount\": 53341469 } ], \"total\": { \"results\": [ { \"uniqueCount\": 2651 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 0, \"endTimeSeconds\": 0, \"inspectedCount\": 5053841114 } }, \"performanceStats\": { \"inspectedCount\": 6088068932, \"responseTime\": 8077 } } ... Copy Line A line chart is useful for spotting trends over time. The line chart plots a timeseries for an attribute. When working in basic query mode, select a single attribute you can plot over time. When using NRQL, SELECT one or more attributes you can plot over time and then use the TIMESERIES function. Use a line chart when you want to Create a chart that lets you easily view trends over a specified time frame. Avoid a line chart when you want to View your data using one or more attributes and see the values associated with each attribute. A bar or table chart is an option. Pie chart A pie chart is the graphic representation of the table. It appears as an option for some functions when the FACET clause is used. To use this chart type, run a query that returns one value for each of a set of attributes. The pie chart maps a set of values as a portion of a whole. To enable pie chart, add a FACET from the dropdown. You can add only one FACET in basic query mode. If you're using NRQL, you can use FACET to add up to 5 attributes, separated by commas, and also include the TIMESERIES function. Pie charts are unavailable for the following aggregator functions: average, apdex, min, max, percentage, and percentile. For uniqueCount, percentages may add up to more than 100%. Use a pie chart when you want to Create a chart that that graphically presents a set of values as they relate to a whole. A pie chart is effective for displaying values for a time period, for example. Avoid a pie chart when you want to Present data that does not use values as they related to a whole, such as with line charts. Pie chart percentage problem When using a pie chart with the uniqueCount aggregator function, the percentages can add up to more than 100%. This is because the attributes being uniquely counted may be present in multiple facets. For example, in the query SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView FACET appName, a single unique user may use multiple apps. Each of these users are included in the unique value for each of the appropriate facets (apps), but the total number of unique users won't change. To solve this, use a bar chart or table to provide a more accurate visualization of uniqueCount data. Table A table is the standard view for a set of values related to a specific attribute (for example, the count of all page views by user agent name). By default, all tables are sortable by any one column. If you are using the FACET clause, the results will normally be returned as a table. Other features of tables: You can use a table as a shortcut to other dashboards. If a table is faceted by attribute, selecting an entry takes you to an existing dashboard filtered by that attribute. You can export a table chart to a CSV file. Details on this functionality: If a filter is applied to a dashboard, the download will only include the subset of data based on the filter. If a specific fixed time range is selected, the CSV includes the data for that time period. If you query with multiple attributes, the export includes columns for all FACETs in the query. For charts with a time range dependent on the present moment (for example, since 30 minutes ago), the data in the CSV is generated from the present moment, not from when the chart was initially generated. The table chart type, with its tabular format, works well for dashboards, as well as sharing the data for use in reports, for example. Use a table when you want to Create a text-compatible table consisting of your data. This table can be shared and used in reports or imported into spreadsheets, for example. Avoid a table when you want to View your data in a graphical format.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add pie charts, before starting this one. In each hands-on lesson in this course, you have been adding something new to your A/B test application. You’ve spun up a new launcher and added multiple chart components to your Nerdlet. In this lesson, you’ll create two new TableChart components that display information about each version of your website, such as the ratio of customers who subscribe to those who unsubscribe. Review your design guide to understand where these tables will fit into your application: In this design guide, the TableChart components come after the pie charts you created in the last lesson. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-tables/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-tables/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named totals.js: bash Copy $ touch totals.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a component called VersionTotals to hold your first TableChart and some mock data: import React from 'react'; import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { const versionATotals = { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } return <TableChart data={[versionATotals]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy TableChart is different from PieChart and LineChart in three big ways. First of all, there are no color or viz metadata attributes in its series. TableChart has a standard visualization, so it ignores things like color, which don't apply. Second, the TableChart series have columns metadata attributes. columns determines the names of the columns on the table. Finally, TableChart series data use neither x nor y values. Instead, they use keys that match the table column and values that determine what goes into the row. Notice that VersionTotals takes a version prop and supplies it to the chart metadata's id and name fields. This allows you to use this same component to create a table for version A and B and eliminate duplicate code. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-tables/ab-test. Step 6 of 8 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 7 of 8 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the TableChart components displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Extra credit There is one more table in the design guide that records past tests. The columns for this table are: End Date: The end date for the test Version A Description: A description for version A Version B Description: A description for version B Winner: The version selected as the final design Try to build this table in your application with these column names and some fake data, without looking at a code sample. This practice will reinforce what you've learned in this lesson. If you need help, review the add-a-chart-group directory of the coursework repository, which corresponds to the next lesson in this course. This has the code for the PastTests component. Each chart you’ll add to your application throughout this course is unique in its type or in the data it presents. So far, you’ve created tables, pie charts, and a line chart, and they all function independently of one another. In the next lesson, you’ll create a couple more line charts, but this time they’ll function together.

In this course, you’re building an A/B test application for the New Relic platform. Previously, you learned about the New Relic One SDK and its component library. Now, It’s time for you to start building your application focusing first on chart components. Before you write any code, consult your design guide to remember what the application will look like when you finish: There are several charts you need to create, which may seem overwhelming at first, but take it one step at a time. The topmost chart, and the first you’ll create, is a line chart that shows the number of users who sign up for your newsletter and what version of your website they were shown. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-your-first-chart/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-your-first-chart/ab-test This directory contains the code your application should have at this point in the course.

Right now, you're using manually-crafted data points. In the future, you'll replace these with data queried from New Relic. Notice that you’ve specified a color for each series in the chart. The color metadata attribute takes any CSS-acceptable color format. Setting viz: 'main' means that you want to render the LineChart series as a line, the component's default display style. For the data prop in the LineChart component, you passed the two series in an array so that both are represented together. Finally, you used the chart’s fullWidth prop to stretch the chart’s width to fill the view. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and replace the default heading in your Nerdlet's render() method with your new component: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-your-first-chart/ab-test.

Change the appearance of your chart When you run your query in advanced (NRQL) mode or view your chart while using basic mode to specify data, the query builder analyzes your data and applies a chart type that fits your data. For some queries, you'll have several options of chart types to choose from. To change chart type, use the Chart type menu to the right of the current chart. Each type in the list has a tooltip with information about using that type. Example of the chart type menu, showing a tooltip. Customize your charts While we try our best to optimize how we display your data, sometimes you may have other needs. To this end, you can customize charts to display information at your convenience. Tip Customizations are available depending on the chart type. Format date and time Tip For table and billboard charts. Customize the date and time format for tables and billboards: for each type of data, you can select if you want to leave it as it is, or modify the format as Numeric or Date. If data is a timestamp, you can choose how to represent the date and time: For numbers, select if you want us to auto-format them, or chose the number of decimals you want to see. Customize the Y axis Tip For line and area charts. On line charts and area charts you can adjust the Y axis to display the data within certain values by setting a minimum and maximum value for the axis. If no customization option is selected, dashboards automatically displays the full Y axis from 0 to the top value plus a margin.

      "body": "When building a query using the query builder, there are a variety of types of visualizations for presenting your data in the optimal format. This table contains all chart types. Whether a chart type is available for your query will be dependent on: The type of query (some query results don't match some chart types) The query mode (basic or advanced) Area chart An area chart shows a time series for a single attribute. The area chart type shows a time series for a single attribute. To enable an area chart, add a FACET to your query. Important You can add only one facet in basic mode. In advanced mode, you can use facet to add up to five attributes, separated by commas. Use the TIMESERIES function when you use a FACET in an NRQL query. Use an area chart when you want to View the measurement of a single attribute over a period of time that you specify. Avoid an area chart when you want to View a chart that contains more than a single attribute. The line chart type is a good option; you can view multiple attributes over a time range that you specify. The bar chart type gives you a comparison view between the attributes; it uses a total of each attribute for the time range you choose. Bar chart The bar chart shows comparisons among the categories returned in the query results. The bar chart compares a related set of values. To enable a bar chart, add a FACET clause to the query. Important You can add only one facet in basic mode. You can use FACET with up to 5 different attributes, separated by commas. Use a bar chart when you want to Create a chart that reports the total count of the data for a category over the specified time range. With the bar chart format, you can easily see the differences between each category. Avoid a bar chart when you want to Include measurements over a period of time. This chart type is not available when using a TIMESERIES clause. The line chart type is a good option for this visualization. Billboard The billboard chart type presents results as a single, highly-visible value. It's an option when your query returns a single number, such as from this query: SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView since 1 day ago Copy A billboard chart is useful for single-stat queries like the Apdex function. Use billboards to monitor values at a glance. Billboards can also be used to compare a single value across states. For instance, use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the same attribute across two different time frames. The billboard chart displays a single value in a large, easy to read font. To enable the data for a billboard chart, search for a single value. You can view multiple values by adding a facet from the dropdown. You can set Warning and Critical thresholds on billboards, which will highlight a chart in yellow or red. The threshold fields are on the right side of the chart edit pane, highlighted in yellow and red respectively. If you want to highlight a chart when a value falls below a given value rather than above it, set the Warning threshold higher than the Critical threshold. Tip Threshold fields will only be available for dashboards that present a single value. For instance, the use of a COMPARE WITH clause will disable the threshold settings in the edit pane. Use a billboard chart when you want to Monitor values, including thresholds for Critical and Warning states, in a large, easy-to-read font. Avoid a billboard chart type when You want to view data over a period of time. The line chart type is a better option for viewing data by time. Bullet chart Use the bullet chart type to represent progress to a target or goal, called the limit. To use this chart type, run a query that returns a single number, such as: SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The bullet chart displays a value compared against a limit. Bullet defaults to a limit that is twice the resulting query value. To adjust the limit, use the Limit field to enter another number. The bullet will adjust accordingly. Tip The bullet chart type can only be used for charts that present a single value. For example, a query using COMPARE WITH will not list bullet as an option. Use a bullet chart when you want to View a chart uses a large, easy-to-read font that helps you view the value quickly. Avoid a bullet chart when you want to View data that has more than a single value. Bar and line chart types may be better choices in this instance. Funnel Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data types that make up the steps toward a specified goal. A funnel allows you to ask, “Of the people that did (A), how many also did (B), and of the people that did (A) and (B), how many also completed (C)?” Sample funnel chart for a shopping site. In this example, you want to determine that of all the visitors that viewed the landing page, how many of them: Browsed the products. Then added one or more products to a shopping cart. And finally, purchased the item(s) in the shopping cart. Unlike other queries, you must use a SELECT funnel() statement in your query; the funnel chart type is not selectable from any other type of query. Additionally, the funnel chart type is only available for queries with eight steps or fewer. A funnel query that includes more than eight steps will only return the results as JSON. SELECT funnel(session, WHERE pageUrl like '%/index.html' AS 'Landing', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/browse/phones' AS 'Browse ', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/shoppingcart' AS 'Cart', WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/checkout' AS 'Purchased') FROM PageView where appName = 'WebPortal' AND duration < 1 SINCE 1 week ago Copy Use a funnel when you want to You want to visually evaluate the paths that visitors take after they hit a page that you designate as a landing page. Avoid a funnel when you want to You only want counts for the attributes in the WHERE clause. You will not be able to choose funnel unless you use SELECT funnel in your query. Heat map The heat map displays data in a tabular format using color gradations to show frequency in specific time buckets. The heat map is a faceted distribution of values where color density represents the values displayed. To enable a heat map, use the Histogram() function with a numeric attribute and use FACET to add up to five attributes, separated by commas. See Histograms: View data distribution for more detailed information about histogram-based charts. Use a heat map when you want to View tabular data for multiple attributes over a period of time, with gradated colors instead of numerals. Avoid a heat map when you want to View the exact data for multiple attributes over a period of time. A line or bar chart may be an option. Histogram A histogram charts frequency across a series of value ranges. Use histograms to show the distribution of data across time buckets. See Histograms: View data distribution for more detailed information about histogram-based charts. Use a histogram when you want to Chart frequency of data over a series of values. Avoid a histogram when you want to View the same data as heat map or to view the data without the time buckets. JSON Use the returned JSON to review the raw data returned and to help develop integrations with New Relic. To implement integrations, use remote queries to return raw JSON as a service. To use this, select the Share menu and click Copy JSON. Example NRQL query: SELECT uniqueCount(name) FROM Transaction WHERE httpResponseCode = '200' TIMESERIES FACET appName LIMIT 10 SINCE 24 hours ago Copy Example JSON response: { \"metadata\": { \"contents\": { \"messages\": [], \"timeSeries\": { \"messages\": [], \"contents\": [ { \"function\": \"uniquecount\", \"attribute\": \"name\", \"simple\": true } ] }, \"bucketSizeMillis\": 1800000 }, \"eventTypes\": [ \"Transaction\" ], \"eventType\": \"Transaction\", \"openEnded\": true, \"messages\": [], \"beginTimeMillis\": 1556226069396, \"endTimeMillis\": 1556312469396, \"beginTime\": \"2019-04-25T21:01:09Z\", \"endTime\": \"2019-04-26T21:01:09Z\", \"guid\": \"5238a2c6-328d-a5ff-9185-7f3f04c42d1e\", \"routerGuid\": \"1aea2ec5-0be8-3a60-7554-851e1b016eb0\", \"rawSince\": \"24 HOURS AGO\", \"rawUntil\": \"NOW\", \"rawCompareWith\": \"\", \"facet\": \"appName\", \"offset\": 0, \"limit\": 10 }, \"facets\": [ { \"name\": \"RPM Combined Production\", \"beginTimeSeconds\": 0, \"endTimeSeconds\": 0, \"timeSeries\": [ { \"results\": [ { \"uniqueCount\": 415 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 1556226069, \"endTimeSeconds\": 1556227869, \"inspectedCount\": 4589471 }, [ { \"uniqueCount\": 1714 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 1556310669, \"endTimeSeconds\": 1556312469, \"inspectedCount\": 53341469 } ], \"total\": { \"results\": [ { \"uniqueCount\": 2651 } ], \"beginTimeSeconds\": 0, \"endTimeSeconds\": 0, \"inspectedCount\": 5053841114 } }, \"performanceStats\": { \"inspectedCount\": 6088068932, \"responseTime\": 8077 } } ... Copy Line A line chart is useful for spotting trends over time. The line chart plots a timeseries for an attribute. When working in basic query mode, select a single attribute you can plot over time. When using NRQL, SELECT one or more attributes you can plot over time and then use the TIMESERIES function. Use a line chart when you want to Create a chart that lets you easily view trends over a specified time frame. Avoid a line chart when you want to View your data using one or more attributes and see the values associated with each attribute. A bar or table chart is an option. Pie chart A pie chart is the graphic representation of the table. It appears as an option for some functions when the FACET clause is used. To use this chart type, run a query that returns one value for each of a set of attributes. The pie chart maps a set of values as a portion of a whole. To enable pie chart, add a FACET from the dropdown. You can add only one FACET in basic query mode. If you're using NRQL, you can use FACET to add up to 5 attributes, separated by commas, and also include the TIMESERIES function. Pie charts are unavailable for the following aggregator functions: average, apdex, min, max, percentage, and percentile. For uniqueCount, percentages may add up to more than 100%. Use a pie chart when you want to Create a chart that that graphically presents a set of values as they relate to a whole. A pie chart is effective for displaying values for a time period, for example. Avoid a pie chart when you want to Present data that does not use values as they related to a whole, such as with line charts. Pie chart percentage problem When using a pie chart with the uniqueCount aggregator function, the percentages can add up to more than 100%. This is because the attributes being uniquely counted may be present in multiple facets. For example, in the query SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView FACET appName, a single unique user may use multiple apps. Each of these users are included in the unique value for each of the appropriate facets (apps), but the total number of unique users won't change. To solve this, use a bar chart or table to provide a more accurate visualization of uniqueCount data. Table A table is the standard view for a set of values related to a specific attribute (for example, the count of all page views by user agent name). By default, all tables are sortable by any one column. If you are using the FACET clause, the results will normally be returned as a table. Other features of tables: You can use a table as a shortcut to other dashboards. If a table is faceted by attribute, selecting an entry takes you to an existing dashboard filtered by that attribute. You can export a table chart to a CSV file. Details on this functionality: If a filter is applied to a dashboard, the download will only include the subset of data based on the filter. If a specific fixed time range is selected, the CSV includes the data for that time period. If you query with multiple attributes, the export includes columns for all FACETs in the query. For charts with a time range dependent on the present moment (for example, since 30 minutes ago), the data in the CSV is generated from the present moment, not from when the chart was initially generated. The table chart type, with its tabular format, works well for dashboards, as well as sharing the data for use in reports, for example. Use a table when you want to Create a text-compatible table consisting of your data. This table can be shared and used in reports or imported into spreadsheets, for example. Avoid a table when you want to View your data in a graphical format.",

Also, remember that we provided you a CSS stylesheet that styles the chartHeader class. You can look at nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss to see more. You don't need to modify your Nerdlet's render() method in index.js because your components encapsulate the new code. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see that your charts have descriptive headings. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Well done! You've created all the charts that are laid out in your design guide. You’ve also organized them into a neat grid and added headings so that the charts are intelligible. While chart headings helps you understand what each chart shows, it'd be nice to add descriptions to help you remember what each version in your A/B test represents. In the next lesson, you'll add a description for each design version. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start.

      "body": "Imagine you've developed a website and instrumented it with New Relic's Browser monitoring. New Relic's core feature set provides a lot of information, but you want something custom. You want to decide if a new design for your site will better engage your users. In other words, you want to A/B test a design and make a decision based on the data. For this task, you could create a New Relic One application, using React, the New Relic One software development kit, and the limitless power of modern web technologies. New Relic One applications are built with one of web development's most popular JavaScript libraries: React. Because you have freedom when writing React code, you can customize your app logic, design your own components, or take advantage of the abundance of open source component libraries. So, for your A/B test app, if you want to write custom logic to end the test based on results, you can do so. The New Relic One software development kit (SDK) allows you to create, serve, publish, and deploy applications to New Relic One. It also provides a host of React components for gathering data, presenting information, handling user interactions, and more. You use components like Button and Dropdown to create an interactive experience that looks and feels native to New Relic. You use Table and Chart components to display data from your New Relic account or elsewhere. When building your A/B test application, you'd use the SDK's NrqlQuery component to fetch Browser data from your account. With custom React code, SDK components, and the wide world of open source libraries, you can create your A/B test application in New Relic One. But before you create one for yourself, you might want to check the app catalog to see if someone has beaten you to it! If the catalog already had an app for that, you could add it to your account with a couple clicks, another benefit of creating apps in New Relic One. Throughout this course, you’re going to build a real-world New Relic One application for running and managing A/B tests. You’ll visualize Browser data for your competing designs, see historical data from past tests, and even choose a winning design and end the test, all from your New Relic One application! But before you get into the weeds of building charts and making http requests, you need to learn what New Relic One applications are made of. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the first lesson: Spin up your demo services.",

      "body": "Problem Your New Relic's synthetic Simple, Scripted, or Scripted API (non-ping) monitor reported an error, but the application appears to have loaded correctly. For ping and simple monitor errors, see non-scripted monitor errors. Solutions Below are some of the most common non-ping monitor error messages. Simple or scripted browser errors Element A is not clickable at point (X, Y). Other element would receive the click: Element B Problem The synthetic script is attempting to .click() an element (Element A) at point (X,Y), but another element (Element B) is obscuring the target element. Solution Set a custom wait time, allowing time for a specific condition to be met. In this case, until the loading animation is no longer visible: .then(function() { return $browser.wait($driver.until.elementIsNotVisible($browser.findElement($driver.By.id('LOADING'))), 10000); }) Copy Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Tip This will not correct .click() issues caused by sticky headers or footers. In these instances, you may need to scroll manually to bring the target into view. Cause This happens if the target element, at the time of the .click() function, is obscured by: A loading overlay, modal, or pop-up An animation that reveals the target element A sticky header or footer Error: element not visible Problem The targeted element is not visible to the Selenium WebDriver. Solution Verify that the targeted element does not have the CSS properties of display: none or visibility: hidden applied. Cause Any element that has a CSS property of display: none or visibility: hidden will not be found by the Selenium WebDriver, as the script will only look for elements that are actually visible to a user. Error: no such element: Unable to locate element: <LOCATOR> Problem The Selenium WebDriver was unable to find this element in the visible DOM. Solution To resolve this problem: Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath where possible as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure, and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. If element is in an iframe, use $browser.switchTo().frame(<index or element reference>. Tip See the Selenium documentation for more information on switchTo() and TargetLocator() functions. Cause Common reasons for this error include: The targeted element is unable to be located by functions such as: $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) or $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [ , timeout: number This may be due to a timing issue. For example, the WebDriver is attempting to locate the element before the page has been loaded. Element is in an iframe, which is a separate document context. JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. NetworkError: Monitor produced no traffic Problem The API test or scripted browser monitor appears to be running but is returning this error. Solution Ensure that $http.get() or $browser.get() are being called appropriately and are generating traffic. For Scripted API monitors, if you are using a request option to spin up an un-instrumented HTTP agent under the hood, specify one of our instrumented HTTP agents using either of the agent request options below: $globalAgents.http $globalAgents.https Example: var options = { uri: 'https://www.newrelic.com', agent: $globalAgents.https, agentOptions: { 'rejectUnauthorized': false }, strictSSL: false }; function callback(err, res, body) { ... }; $http.get(options, callback); Copy Cause This occurs in scripted monitor runs when the HTTP client ($http in Scripted API monitors) or Chrome browser ($browser in Scripted Browser monitors) is not used to generate HTTP traffic. In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by synthetic monitoring, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the monitor's settings. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assigned the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. StaleElementReferenceError: element is not attached to the page document Problem The target page has loaded, but there was a change to an element between the execution of an element locator and an action being executed on the element. Solution Set your scripted browser to wait until the page is settled before performing a findElement() action. This can be accomplished by setting a custom wait time, using the $browser.wait(fn, timeout) function prior to the findElement call, to wait for a condition that indicates a settled page state. This will make it less likely for DOM manipulation to cause a reference to go stale. Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Cause This error typically happens when the script attempts to .click() an element after using either the findElement() or waitForAndFindElement() function. If the DOM has changed between when the element locator was generated and the action was executed against the element, this error will occur because the actual element has changed. For example: the findElement() function is used to generate an element reference while the page’s script is actively manipulating the DOM. The DOM is then changed, causing the previously generated reference to become stale. The now out-of-date reference is used in an attempt to perform a .click() action, resulting in this monitor failure. Tip For more information, see the Selenium documentation on Stale Element Reference Exceptions. TaskTimedOut: task timed-out waiting for element to be located using: <LOCATOR> Problem The waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function failed to locate an element within the provided timeout. Solution Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath() where possible, as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. Cause The target element did not exist on the page when the waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function was called. This may be caused by the target page not being in the expected state. Common reasons for this error include: There is a legitimate issue with the target site. The element locator being used is incorrect. The target site has changed, requiring the revision of the Synthetics script. The previous action in the script did not successfully complete, causing the page to be in an unexpected state when the subsequent waitForAndFindElement() call was initiated. TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Problem The target page loaded successfully, but returned the error: TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Solution If the failures began suddenly, investigate any requests that could be blocking or delaying the page load event. If you are unsure which request is causing the error, use the timeline view to identify any long running HTTP requests. If the page is frequently unable to fully load within the current timeout, set a custom page load timeout using the $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) function. Cause The target page loaded successfully, but the page load event was not fired within the page load timeout set in the .pageLoadTimeout() function. There are a number of reasons you could see this error message, including: A blocked resource request on the page held up the page load. A resource request processed slower than normal due to an underlying network issue. A dependent resource on the page blocked the iframe load event. TypeError: $browser.isElementPresent is not a function Problem The function isElementPresent(), used by Synthetics monitors with a runtime >= 0.5.0, has been deprecated in Selenium 3. Solution To continue to use this function after depreciation you will need to create a custom version of this function, such as: return $browser.findElements(ele).then(function(found) { return found.length > 0; }); } Copy Example usage, which would return true: $browser .get(\"https://www.newrelic.com\") .then(function() { return isElementPresent($driver.By.id(\"nav_signup\")); }) .then(function(found) { return console.log(found); }); Copy Cause This can occur when attempting to use a Synthetics Scripted Browser monitor script from an older monitor ( < = 0.4.1 runtime) with a newer Synthetics monitor ( >= 0.5.0) runtime. Scripted API monitor errors JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds.

In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by Synthetics, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the Monitor Settings page. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated.

If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. SyntaxError: Unexpected token < Problem JSON.parse() was passed a string that begins with the < character and is likely HTML, instead of JSON. Solution Ensure the target endpoint is returning the expected response body. You can do this by logging the response body in the callback, before attempting to parse. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(body); // Log HTML response body, don't parse as JSON }); Copy Depending on the target API endpoint, you may need to include specific request headers to ensure that JSON is returned. Cause The script is attempting to use JSON.parse() on a response body after a request is made and is expecting the endpoint to return JSON, but HTML was returned instead. SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0 Problem JSON.parse() was passed an undefined parameter, but expected a JSON string. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } var bodyJson = JSON.parse(body); console.log(bodyJson); // Log response body }); Copy Cause This can occur in Scripted API monitors when a performing an API request, then attempting to parse the request response within the callback function. The response body is passed to JSON.parse() without checking if the response body is undefined first. An undefined response body is often caused by a request error. If there is no error handling to prevent code that parses the response body, this monitor failure will occur. TypeError: Cannot read property 'statusCode' of undefined Problem The response object (and thus response.statusCode) in an API request callback is undefined. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(response.statusCode); }); Copy Cause This error occurs when there was an error completing the API request (for example, unable to reach server, unable to resolve DNS). In these instances, the request was not completed so the response object in the callback function arguments is undefined. If there is no error handling to prevent code that checks response status code, this monitor failure will occur.",

      "body": "Every time you deploy an application, you hope that it's efficient and error-free. The reality, however, is usually quite different. You might introduce a bug in a release, overlook an edge case, or rely on a broken dependency. These issues, and others, can result in bad user experiences. In this guide, you: Use the open-source New Relic demo-deployer to spin up the infrastructure for Acme Telco Lite, a fictional company. This demo scenario is part of our Demo Catalog and will simulate real-world issues in a controlled, demo environment Use New Relic to understand those issues from the perspective of a Telco Lite developer Use the deployer to tear down the resources you create Welcome to Acme Telco Lite! Acme Telco Lite is a mock telecom business that maintains an eCommerce website for its customers. The site's architecture has eight, interconnected microservices, plus a simulator: The simulator isn't part of the Telco Lite infrastructure, but it is part of the demo deployment. It runs scenarios against the application to create web traffic and generate interesting data in New Relic. Set up your environment Before you begin, follow the Prerequisites guide from the deployer's GitHub repository for a detailed walkthrough of how to set up your environment. For this guide, you can choose between Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host your deployment. The guide steps you through: Installing Docker & pulling the demo-deployer image locally Creating a user config file containing credentials for New Relic and your cloud provider Downloading a .pem key file (if your cloud provider is AWS) Once you're all set up, deploy Acme Telco Lite. Deploy Telco Lite It's time to deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services using demo-deployer. Copy the url for the demo that corresponds to the cloud provider you chose when you set up your environment: AWS Telco Lite Demo Azure Telco Lite Demo GCP Telco Lite Demo Follow the Deployment guide in the Demo Catalog repository for a thorough explanation of how to use the deployer in a local Docker environment. When you run the deployment script, make sure to pass the url you copied for <demo-url>. Tip Since Telco Lite contains several services, the deployment can take over half an hour.

View your services With your services running in the cloud, log in to New Relic and select APM from the top navigation to see how your services are holding up: Yikes! The alerts, high response times, and red-colored indicators suggest things aren't well. Use New Relic to diagnose these issues, which are simultaneously affecting your services: Issue 1: The Warehouse Portal has abnormally high response times Issue 2: Multiple services are raising error alerts Tip Don't worry if you don't see all the same alerts. The simulator triggers issues at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. Tear down Telco Lite When you're finished diagnosing all the issues effecting Telco Lite, follow the Teardown guide in the deployer's repository to tear down the services you created in your cloud provider. If you're still exploring, don't tear down your services, or you'll have to deploy them again later. Conclusion Congratulations, you're done! Throughout this tutorial, you: Used the demo-deployer to deploy Telco Lite to the cloud Used New Relic to investigate simulated issues in Telco Lite services Tore down all the infrastructural resources you created throughout this tutorial Hopefully, you learned a lot about using New Relic to investigate issues in your services.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you learned of a third-party service that you can use to fetch mock cancellation data for the Total cancellations per version chart in your New Relic One application. Even though the data in this service is fake, the real value of this lesson is learning how you can use third party services to supply data to your New Relic One application. If you make a request to the mock service with cancellation data (https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations) you'll see a response rejecting your request with a message that reads \"Unauthorized\": bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations Unauthorized This is because the Nerdsletter API requires an Authorization header. More specifically, you must pass a bearer token of ABC123 to gain authorized access to its data. If you make a request to the service with the header Authorization: Bearer ABC123, you'll get a successful response with the mocked cancellation data: bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations -H 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' {\"a\": 15, \"b\": 78} In the last lesson, you used NerdGraph to store this API token in your New Relic One application's NerdStorageVault data store. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component and logged its use to your browser's console. In this lesson, you follow up that log statement with a real request to the Nerdsletter API using your authorization token. Then, you supply the data from that external resource to your Total cancellations per version chart. Step 1 of 6 Change to the third-party-services/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/third-party-services/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 6 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js, make a request to api.nerdsletter.net with your API token. Save the results to state, and use that state in render(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { cancellations: [], lastToken: null } } generateChartData(data) { const cancellationsA = data ? data.a : 0; const cancellationsB = data ? data.b : 0; return [ { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsA }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsB }, ], }, ] } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`Requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) fetch( \"https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations\", {headers: {\"Authorization\": `Bearer ${this.props.token}`}} ).then( (response) => { if (response.status == 200) { return response.json() } else if (response.status == 401) { console.error(\"Incorrect auth header\") } else { console.error(response.text()) } } ).then( (data) => { if (data) { this.setState({ cancellations: this.generateChartData(data), lastToken: this.props.token }) } } ) } } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={this.state.cancellations} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy In this code, you initialize TotalCancellations.state.cancellations with zero for the y-value in each series instead of the previously hardcoded values. This helps to more realistically represent what the chart should show if your New Relic One app hasn't successfully requested data from the Nerdsletter API. Next, you use Javascript's fetch() function to make an HTTP request to the Nerdsletter API. You then pass your token in the request's Authorization header. If the request is successful, you update the cancellation data in TotalCancellations.state so that that data is reflected in the component's render method. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/third-party-service/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. If your token in NerdStorageVault is not \"ABC123\", then your console will show an error that reads, \"Incorrect auth header\": If you set the token to \"ABC123\", then Total cancellations per version updates to show the values from the third-party service: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great job! You've come a long way from running nr1 nerdpack:create for the first time. Take a look back at your design guide to see that your application now has everything from an interface and data perspective that you planned from the beginning: You've created eight charts with varying styles and supplied them with dynamic data from multiple sources. You've learned about the New Relic One SDK and used many of its components. You've even gathered data from a third-party service and mixed it seemlessly with your New Relic data to provide a complete look at how the competing versions in your A/B test perform against each other. From here, there is only one more set of APIs in the New Relic One SDK that you've yet to get your hands on: Platform APIs. These will come in handy in improving the usability of your New Relic One application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you used PlatformStateContext from the New Relic One SDK to look up the time range that the user selected from the app's time picker. Now, you'll learn about another component that interacts with the New Relic platform: navigation. The navigation component lets you open entities, navigate to entities, and build Location objects for entities from your Nerdlet. You can also use navigation for other Nerdlets and launchers. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-navigation/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In newsletter-signups.js, create a new method, called NewsletterSignups.openApmEntity(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. This method uses navigation.openStackedEntity() to display your demo application's APM entity in a stacked view. Notice openApmEntity() requires your ENTITY_GUID. You need to locate that ID and store it in a constant. Step 3 of 10 Navigate to APM: See metadata for your Newsletter service: Copy the entity's GUID: Create an ENTITY_GUID constant: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and the entity GUID you just copied, respectively. Now, openApmEntity() knows what entity to show. Next, you need to create a button to invoke this method. Step 4 of 10 Create a button to show your APM entity: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you've created a button and configured it to call openApmEntity() when it's clicked. Step 5 of 10 Import Stack and StackItem: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. You'll use Stack and StackItem to lay out the button on the far right side of the same row that the HeadingText is on. Step 6 of 10 Lay out the Stack: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <Stack fullWidth> <StackItem grow={true}> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> </StackItem> <StackItem> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> </StackItem> </Stack> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you used a full-width Stack to set up the layout for the row. To make the HeadingText fill the entire row except the width of the button, you used the StackItem.grow prop. Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. Click App performance: Now you see the stacked entity: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively Congratulations! You're finished writing all the code you'll write for your New Relic One A/B test application. Now, you have an application reporting New Relic data from your demo service that is running an A/B test. You've created several charts, buttons, and other UI elements. And you've organized your components into a readable and usable view. On top of the visuals, you've supplied data to your charts from multiple data sources in and outside of New Relic. You've created some backend functionality which utilizes your New Relic One application's own data store. You've also utilized the platform APIs for interacting with platform UI and showing a stacked entity view. You've really accomplished a lot throughout this course, so far. There are only a few things left to do! First, is to learn how to publish and subscribe to your New Relic One application so that it can run on our platform instead of your own local server. Second, is to learn how to deal with some common issues you might see in New Relic One application development. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Describe your app for the catalog.",

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: allows you to configure your Nerdlet and write to your Nerdlet's URL state.",

      "body": "This guide steps you through the process of adding access to our time picker in the sample transaction overview application. The sample application provides an overview of the telemetry data showing your account's transactions by application, average response time, HTTP response codes, and transaction errors. When you enable the time picker, users can specify the time range of data to view. We also have a 12 minute video that covers the steps below. Before you begin To develop projects, you need our New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete steps 1–4 of the CLI quick start. In step 1, be sure to make a copy of the number preceding your account name. This is your accound ID, and you’ll need it later. Important If you've already installed the New Relic One CLI, but you can't remember your account ID, start the CLI quick start again, and then click the Get your API key down arrow. The account ID is the number preceding your account name. For additional details, see Set up your development environment. Prepare the time picker sample code To get started, complete these steps to update the application UUID (unique ID) and run the sample application locally: Step 1 of 7 If you haven't already done so, clone the example applications from our how-to GitHub repo. bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git Step 2 of 7 Change to the directory nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet: bash Copy $ cd nr1-how-to/add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet Step 3 of 7 In your preferred text editor, open index.js. Step 4 of 7 Replace <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID> with your account id: Important Your account ID is available in the CLI quick start (see Before you begin). this.accountId = <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID>; Copy Step 5 of 7 Change to the add-time-picker directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/add-time-picker Step 6 of 7 Execute these commands to update the UUID and serve the sample application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 7 of 7 Once the sample application is successfully served, go to the local version of New Relic One (https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local) click Apps, and click Add Time Picker. After launching the Add Time Picker application, you see a dashboard that gives an overview of the transactions in your New Relic account: By default, the application shows your data within the last 60 minutes. If you toggle the time picker, it doesn't update the charts because the transaction overview application isn't connected to the New Relic One platform. It has no access to the data from the time picker. In the following sections, you'll add the time picker to the example application and add the time to the queries. Import the PlatformStateContext component The first step in adding the time picker is to import the PlatformStateContext component. Important If you need more details about the PlatformStateContext example that follows, see the APIs and components page Here's what the PlatformStateContext component does: Wraps all of the code within the return statement of the render method Makes a function call passing in the New Relic platform state Returns all of the code within our current return statement Complete these steps: Step 1 of 5 In a text editor, open /add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet/index.js. Step 2 of 5 Add the PlatformStateContext component to the end of the import statement so it looks like this: import { Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 3 of 5 Just below the current return insert this code for the PlatformStateContext component: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { return ( // ADD THE CURRENT RETURN CODE HERE ) }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> Copy Step 4 of 5 Move the current application code so it is under the return of the PlatformState function call. The return statement should now look like this: return ( <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(PlatformState) => { return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> ); Copy Step 5 of 5 Add a console.log statement to make sure you are seeing appropriate data. Insert the following code inside the PlatformState return statement just before the opening tag for the <Grid> component: /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ console.log(PlatformState); Copy After you complete these steps, your browser console displays something like this: Add the time to the queries In your console, you should see some data from the New Relic platform state. Now you're ready to add timeRange data to update the charts in the transaction overview application. This step requires you to import the timeRangeToNrql utility method from the New Relic One community library. Important You can get more details on the New Relic One community library from our GitHub repo. This helper method takes your PlatformState.timeRange duration data, formats it from milliseconds, and returns a formatted SINCE statement to add to your NRQL. Step 1 of 4 Import the timeRangeToNrql method by inserting this line of code below the other import sections: Important You don't need to include the AccountDropdown from the community import example. import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; Copy Step 2 of 4 Pass the PlatformState to the timeRangeToNrql helper, and save its output as a since statement for later use: const since = timeRangeToNrql(PlatformState); Copy Step 3 of 4 After creating the since variable, go through the code in the PlatformStateContext return statement and concatenate the since variable in each of the existing chart component queries. Here's a TableChart example: <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview + since} />; Copy Step 4 of 4 After you update all of the chart components, confirm that the final index.js file looks similar to this: Important This completed sample code is in your nerdlet final.js. import React from 'react'; import { PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart, } from 'nr1'; import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.accountId = 1; } render() { const avgResTime = `SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES AUTO `; const trxOverview = `FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) as 'Transactions', apdex(duration) as 'apdex', percentile(duration, 99, 95) FACET appName `; const errCount = `FROM TransactionError SELECT count(*) as 'Transaction Errors' FACET error.message `; const responseCodes = `SELECT count(*) as 'Response Code' FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode `; return ( <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(PlatformState) => { /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ console.log(PlatformState); const since = timeRangeToNrql(PlatformState); console.log(since); return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount + since} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> ); } } Copy Summary When you completed all the steps in this example, you successfully implemented the time picker in your application by importing the PlatformStateContext component and accessing its timePicker data object.",

Step 1 of 6 Change to the add-chart-headings/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-chart-headings/ab-test Step 2 of 6 In newsletter-signups.js, page-views.js, past-tests.js, total-cancellations.js, total-subscriptions.js, and totals.js, import HeadingText and add a descriptive heading above the chart in each of your custom components: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } const versionBSignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-b-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 20 }, { x: 10, y: 5 }, { x: 20, y: 25 }, { x: 30, y: 45 }, { x: 40, y: 50 }, { x: 50, y: 35 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionASignups, versionBSignups]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [ { \"endDate\": \"12-15-2020\", \"versionADescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was green.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was blue.\", \"winner\": \"A\" }, { \"endDate\": \"09-06-2019\", \"versionADescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a carousel.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a grid.\", \"winner\": \"B\" } ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { const versionATotals = { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[versionATotals]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Notice the new <div> tag in each render(), which allows you to return multiple elements at once. Also, remember that we provided you a CSS stylesheet that styles the chartHeader class. You can look at nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss to see more. You don't need to modify your Nerdlet's render() method in index.js because your components encapsulate the new code. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see that your charts have descriptive headings. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Well done! You've created all the charts that are laid out in your design guide. You’ve also organized them into a neat grid and added headings so that the charts are intelligible. While chart headings helps you understand what each chart shows, it'd be nice to add descriptions to help you remember what each version in your A/B test represents. In the next lesson, you'll add a description for each design version. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add version descriptions, before starting this one. In this course, you’re building an A/B test application in New Relic. The application presents a lot of data, through its charts, about the effectiveness of each design version you’re testing on your demo website. Ultimately, you’ll be able to use that data to decide which design is most effective and show that design to every user who visits your site. In this lesson, you’ll build a form into your application that lets you choose which design you want to show to every user of your site. Before writing any code, look at your design guide to review the section you’re going to build: This new section has three main components: A heading with instructional copy: \"Pick a version to end the test\" A component that you use to crown the winning version of the A/B test A button to confirm the winner that you selected Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-end-test-section/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named end-test.js: bash Copy $ touch end-test.js Step 3 of 10 In this new file, create a VersionSelector component to encapsulate a Select and its SelectItem child components: import React from 'react'; import { Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy VersionSelector renders a Select component with two choices. In each SelectItem, you specify a value prop. In this case, you use 'A' to represent version A and 'B' to represent version B. Step 4 of 10 Create another component for a Button you'll use to make your test as ended: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy This looks trivial, but it will encapsulate button logic as you iterate on your app code. Step 5 of 10 Create a final component for the entire section you'll use to mark the end of your test: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you create a Grid with three items. First, you create a GridItem that contains a HeadingText and spans all 12 columns. In the next row, you have two items: The VersionSelector component you created in the previous step A Button which reads \"End test\" These items each span one column, but instead of using columnSpan, they use a combination of columnStart and columnEnd to specify which columns they cover. Step 6 of 10 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, add EndTestSection to your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. However, you need to make a few improvements to this code. When you select a version, the selected value in the component doesn't change. You must control the value that Select displays using its value prop and onChange event handler. In the next lesson, you’ll update your code to persist your version choice in the Select component. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Persist the selected version.",

Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import VersionDescription, create descriptions for each design version, and create a new GridItem component for each design version: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you've created two VersionDescription components. You passed the description and version props, which correspond to a design version. You also added a horizontal rule to visually separate the descriptions from the charts in your app. For this, you added a GridItem with a columnSpan of 12, to stretch the rule the full width of the grid. Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-version-descriptions/ab-test. Step 6 of 8 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 7 of 8 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now, you've added descriptions for your competing designs and your charts. In the next lesson, you’ll create a new section of your application from user interface components. This section will be used to end the A/B test with the click of a button. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Add a section to end your test.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Present an end test confirmation modal, before starting this one. In this series, you're building a full-fledged New Relic One application that ingests data from a demo service that's running an A/B test. The app shows the A/B test data in interesting ways so that you'll ultimately be able to choose whether Version A or Version B is more effective at accomplishing your business goal: to increase high-quality newsletter subscriptions. In past tutorials, you created charts to visualize your data, and you organized those charts so you can use and understand them. You also created a form in your app for ending your test once you're confident in the most effective version. Until now, though, you can't gauge which version is more effective because your charts have been showing mock data, such as: const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } Copy A chart's data prop is useful for supplying manually-crafted data like this or even reformatted third-party data. But for many of your charts, you want to show real-time New Relic data. For example, Newsletter subscriptions by version should show subscription data, which exists in New Relic's database, NRDB for short. To query NRDB, you first need to know what data you're looking for. Remember your demo backend service? Well, that service reports a subscription event to New Relic when a user subscribes to a newsletter from your site. You can view these subscription events in New Relic while your demo services are running. View Subscription Events in New Relic Before you query NRDB from your charts, experiment with querying data from New Relic's web interface. Step 1 of 3 From your New Relic homepage, go to to the Data explorer from the top navigation menu: Data explorer lets you explore your telemetry data: metrics events logs traces Since the backend submits newsletter subscriptions as events to New Relic, you can see them in this view. Step 2 of 3 Select subscription from the Custom events menu: This queries NRDB for subscription event totals per minute over the last 30 minutes and shows that data in a chart: Step 3 of 3 Click Dimensions to see a list of the attributes associated with these subscription events: You can filter and group subscription events using these dimensions. Notice the NRQL query above the chart. This shows the chart's underlying query, which is based on these dimensions. Click the page-version dimension to see the query change to group by FACET page_version: The Data explorer presents two options for filtering and sorting your data: User interface (UI) selections like the one you've just made New Relic Query Language (NRQL) The UI is useful for quickly filtering data, and it doesn't require you to know NRQL. For your New Relic One application, however, you need to use NRQL queries. Click the NRQL query to navigate to the Query builder: Here, you can view and manually edit the query to fetch the data you need. Update NewsletterSignups with a NrqlQuery Before you begin integrating New Relic data in your NR1 app, consult your design guide: Your New Relic One application has eight charts in total, including line charts, pie charts, and table charts. Each of these charts currently shows mock data, but they need to show real data to be useful. First, focus on querying data for the topmost chart: Newsletter subscriptions per version. With the query you've built in the Data explorer, you already have the data you need for this chart: Technical detail In your query, you fetch subscription totals (SELECT count(*) FROM subscriptions), group them by their page version (FACET page_version), and focus the timeseries to the past 30 minutes (SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES). Explore our documentation to learn more about NRQL queries. Next, you learn how to pass your NRQL query to your Newsletter subscriptions per version chart. Step 1 of 7 Change to the add-nrql-components/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nrql-components/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, update the LineChart in NewsletterSignups. Remove the mock data, and use the NRQL query you built in the Data explorer: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. In NrqlQuery, you set two props: accountId: The id for the account you query from query: The query to perform With these, your NR1 app can query the data you want to show in your chart. Tip There is a convenience prop for using NRQL to supply data to your charts, called query. If you'd rather not use the NrqlQuery component, try the query prop instead: <LineChart accountId={<YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID>} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" /> Copy Keep in mind you must still supply the accountId. Step 3 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nrql-components/ab-test. Step 4 of 7 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 7 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 7 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: Newsletter subscriptions by version now shows real data from New Relic's database rather than the mock data you defined before. Notice that your chart pulls data when your application loads, but does not continue pulling data while the application is open. You can fix this by adding another prop. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 7 of 7 Add a pollInterval: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. The pollInterval is the number of milliseconds between chart refreshes. Each time the chart refreshes, it queries fresh data from New Relic. In this case, you refresh every minute. Populate your PieChart with subscription event data Now that you've seen how to passed New Relic data to Newsletter subscriptions per version, it's time to move on to Total subscriptions per version. These two charts are similar in that they compare subscription event data grouped by version. The primary differences between Newsletter subscriptions per version and Total subscriptions per version are: One is a line chart and one is a pie chart One shows timeseries data and one shows all-time totals Step 1 of 2 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js, update the TestDistributions component, removing the mock data and populating the PieChart with the same NRQL query you used for Newsletter subscriptions per version but with different TIMESERIES and SINCE clauses: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, PieChart, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 7 DAYS AGO\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <PieChart data={data} fullWidth /> } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. You don't need the TIMESERIES clause because the pie chart only shows numerical data. You don't need the SINCE clause because Total subscriptions per version needs to show all-time subscription totals. Step 2 of 2 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: Total subscriptions per version now shows all-time subscription totals from both versions of your demo application. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Well done! You've configured some charts to query real subscription data from New Relic's database. Populate charts with pageView event data Consider the remaining charts that still use mock data: Total unsubscriptions per version Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions Version A - Page views Version B - Page views Past tests Some of these charts need to show page view data. Fortunately, your demo application creates a custom event for every page view like it does for subscriptions! Since Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions require data from two sources, ignore these for now and focus on Version A - Page views and Version B - Page views. Step 1 of 2 In page-views.js, remove the mock data from VersionPageViews and use a NrqlQuery component to supply a query: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 2 of 2 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: In these new queries, you fetch pageView custom events instead of subscription events. You also use a WHERE clause to filter to a particular page_version rather than a FACET to group by page_version. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Phew, that's a lot of queries, but your application looks great! You're now showing real data in four charts. Remember the two charts you ignored because they require data from two sources? Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions You have to handle these differently than you did for the charts you've been dealing with because NRQL has no method for querying data from multiple sources. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to supply data to these two charts. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize NRQL data, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { this[index] = { endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, } }, data ) historicalData.data = data return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data, format it according to the TableChart specifications, and set it on historicalData.data. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet.",

Change the appearance of your chart When you run your query in advanced (NRQL) mode or view your chart while using basic mode to specify data, the query builder analyzes your data and applies a chart type that fits your data. For some queries, you'll have several options of chart types to choose from. To change chart type, use the Chart type menu to the right of the current chart. Each type in the list has a tooltip with information about using that type. Example of the chart type menu, showing a tooltip. Customize your charts While we try our best to optimize how we display your data, sometimes you may have other needs. To this end, you can customize charts to display information at your convenience. Tip Customizations are available depending on the chart type. Format date and time Tip For table and billboard charts. Customize the date and time format for tables and billboards: for each type of data, you can select if you want to leave it as it is, or modify the format as Numeric or Date. If data is a timestamp, you can choose how to represent the date and time: For numbers, select if you want us to auto-format them, or chose the number of decimals you want to see. Customize the Y axis Tip For line and area charts. On line charts and area charts you can adjust the Y axis to display the data within certain values by setting a minimum and maximum value for the axis. If no customization option is selected, dashboards automatically displays the full Y axis from 0 to the top value plus a margin. Enable or disable the legend Tip For line and area charts, and histograms. For line charts, area charts, and histograms, you can disable or enable the legend. Remove the other groups facet Tip For bar and pie charts, and tables. When faceting on bar charts, pie charts, or tables, and if the number of faceting on queries is larger than 2,000, the Other groups facet aggregates the rest of facets. With this customization you can select whether to see Other groups, or remove it. More chart-specific features For more chart type-specific features, see Chart types.

Important Are you a New Relic Insights user? See our transition guide. Why it matters Modern business systems are a complex maze of data-generating elements. You need an easy, solid way to fetch, analyze, and visualize the never-ending stream of data flowing from your daily working activities. Use the query builder to: Quickly access your data and build customized charts to learn and understand the health of your infrastructure, applications, and other services. Add charts to your dashboards to obtain a complete real-time view of the state of your system. Share your charts with colleagues or users in just two clicks. Get acquainted with querying by using basic mode, then switch to advanced mode to refine your charts using NRQL. Get started Before querying, you may want to read Introduction to querying and how to explore your data. To find the query builder, go to one.newrelic.com and click Query your data. Use the query builder: basic and advanced modes The query builder has several modes: Basic mode Advanced (NRQL) mode Advanced (PromQL-style) mode Tip You can also switch to the Data explorer tab at any time to browse your data and create charts visually, without performing queries. Basic mode Basic mode doesn't require a query language, and so it's useful if you aren't familiar with NRQL or SQL. It's also a quick way to answer one-off questions, such as how many cities outside of the United States are accessing the shopping site for your company. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Basic mode Use basic mode to guide you through the process to specify data for a chart. With basic mode you can: Choose your data source. In basic mode, you start by selecting an event and then picking the attribute that corresponds to the information to show in your chart. Specify (filter) the data for your chart. You can narrow the results and choose an attribute to facet by. Select the time range to present in the chart. You can select a time range from the menu or use the custom option to create your own time range. See Use basic mode for more information about this feature. Advanced (NRQL) mode With the advanced (NRQL) mode you can create your own queries using the NRQL query language. NRQL queries may be simple or complex, depending on what data you want to use and how to display it in your chart. This example of the advanced mode shows the NRQL query with the same data as used in basic mode. one.newrelic.com > Query your data > Query builder > Advanced (NRQL). Use advanced (NRQL) mode to write a query that specifies data for a chart. Tip With APM's real time streaming, you can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in dashboards. See Use advanced (NRQL) mode for more information about using this feature. Advanced (PromQL-style) mode With the advanced (PromQL-style) mode you can run basic PromQL-style queries. You can switch between basic and advanced modes while defining your query in order to: customize some of the values. learn how NRQL queries are structured using the data you specified in basic mode. Important If you build your query in basic mode and update it using advanced mode, you cannot return to basic mode to edit that query. You must make any additional changes in advanced (NRQL) mode. Once you specify the data you want, your chart is ready to view. Your query automatically runs in basic mode as you make changes to the inputs. If using advanced (NRQL or PromQL-style) mode, run your query. Use your charts Once you have built your chart you can: Change the type of chart. Based on the data you specified, the query builder selects the chart type that displays your results most effectively.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your New Relic APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add a section to end your test, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you created a section of your application that allows you to pick the most effective design from your A/B test. The goal of this section is to end the test once you’ve selected a winner: When you select a version from this form, the selection does not persist in the Select component. Now, it’s time to implement that behavior. Step 1 of 11 Change to the persist-selected-version/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/persist-selected-version/ab-test Step 2 of 11 In end-test.js, initialize EndTestSection.state with a default selectedVersion field: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 3 of 11 Pass the selectedVersion, as a prop, to VersionSelector: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 4 of 11 Supply the selectedVersion to your Select component in VersionSelector: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 5 of 11 Create a method, selectVersion(), that updates EndTestSection.state: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy You must bind selectVersion to the EndTestSection component so it can access state. Step 6 of 11 Pass the method to VersionSelector as a prop: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 7 of 11 Set selectVersion as the onChange callback in VersionSelector: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 8 of 11 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/persist-selected-version/ab-test. Step 9 of 11 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 10 of 11 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 11 of 11 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Voila! When you select a new version as the winner of the A/B test, that version is reflected in the menu. However, when you press End test, nothing happens.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Present an end test confirmation modal, before starting this one. In this series, you're building a full-fledged New Relic One application that ingests data from a demo service that's running an A/B test. The app shows the A/B test data in interesting ways so that you'll ultimately be able to choose whether Version A or Version B is more effective at accomplishing your business goal: to increase high-quality newsletter subscriptions. In past tutorials, you created charts to visualize your data, and you organized those charts so you can use and understand them. You also created a form in your app for ending your test once you're confident in the most effective version. Until now, though, you can't gauge which version is more effective because your charts have been showing mock data, such as: const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } Copy A chart's data prop is useful for supplying manually-crafted data like this or even reformatted third-party data. But for many of your charts, you want to show real-time New Relic data. For example, Newsletter subscriptions by version should show subscription data, which exists in New Relic's database, NRDB for short. To query NRDB, you first need to know what data you're looking for. Remember your demo backend service? Well, that service reports a subscription event to New Relic when a user subscribes to a newsletter from your site. You can view these subscription events in New Relic while your demo services are running. View Subscription Events in New Relic Before you query NRDB from your charts, experiment with querying data from New Relic's web interface. Step 1 of 3 From your New Relic homepage, go to to the Data explorer from the top navigation menu: Data explorer lets you explore your telemetry data: metrics events logs traces Since the backend submits newsletter subscriptions as events to New Relic, you can see them in this view. Step 2 of 3 Select subscription from the Custom events menu: This queries NRDB for subscription event totals per minute over the last 30 minutes and shows that data in a chart: Step 3 of 3 Click Dimensions to see a list of the attributes associated with these subscription events: You can filter and group subscription events using these dimensions. Notice the NRQL query above the chart. This shows the chart's underlying query, which is based on these dimensions. Click the page-version dimension to see the query change to group by FACET page_version: The Data explorer presents two options for filtering and sorting your data: User interface (UI) selections like the one you've just made New Relic Query Language (NRQL) The UI is useful for quickly filtering data, and it doesn't require you to know NRQL. For your New Relic One application, however, you need to use NRQL queries. Click the NRQL query to navigate to the Query builder: Here, you can view and manually edit the query to fetch the data you need. Update NewsletterSignups with a NrqlQuery Before you begin integrating New Relic data in your NR1 app, consult your design guide: Your New Relic One application has eight charts in total, including line charts, pie charts, and table charts. Each of these charts currently shows mock data, but they need to show real data to be useful. First, focus on querying data for the topmost chart: Newsletter subscriptions per version. With the query you've built in the Data explorer, you already have the data you need for this chart: Technical detail In your query, you fetch subscription totals (SELECT count(*) FROM subscriptions), group them by their page version (FACET page_version), and focus the timeseries to the past 30 minutes (SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES). Explore our documentation to learn more about NRQL queries. Next, you learn how to pass your NRQL query to your Newsletter subscriptions per version chart. Step 1 of 7 Change to the add-nrql-components/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nrql-components/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, update the LineChart in NewsletterSignups. Remove the mock data, and use the NRQL query you built in the Data explorer: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. In NrqlQuery, you set two props: accountId: The id for the account you query from query: The query to perform With these, your NR1 app can query the data you want to show in your chart. Tip There is a convenience prop for using NRQL to supply data to your charts, called query. If you'd rather not use the NrqlQuery component, try the query prop instead: <LineChart accountId={<YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID>} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" /> Copy Keep in mind you must still supply the accountId. Step 3 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nrql-components/ab-test. Step 4 of 7 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 7 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 7 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: Newsletter subscriptions by version now shows real data from New Relic's database rather than the mock data you defined before. Notice that your chart pulls data when your application loads, but does not continue pulling data while the application is open. You can fix this by adding another prop. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 7 of 7 Add a pollInterval: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. The pollInterval is the number of milliseconds between chart refreshes. Each time the chart refreshes, it queries fresh data from New Relic. In this case, you refresh every minute. Populate your PieChart with subscription event data Now that you've seen how to passed New Relic data to Newsletter subscriptions per version, it's time to move on to Total subscriptions per version. These two charts are similar in that they compare subscription event data grouped by version. The primary differences between Newsletter subscriptions per version and Total subscriptions per version are: One is a line chart and one is a pie chart One shows timeseries data and one shows all-time totals Step 1 of 2 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js, update the TestDistributions component, removing the mock data and populating the PieChart with the same NRQL query you used for Newsletter subscriptions per version but with different TIMESERIES and SINCE clauses: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, PieChart, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 7 DAYS AGO\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <PieChart data={data} fullWidth /> } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. You don't need the TIMESERIES clause because the pie chart only shows numerical data. You don't need the SINCE clause because Total subscriptions per version needs to show all-time subscription totals. Step 2 of 2 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: Total subscriptions per version now shows all-time subscription totals from both versions of your demo application. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Well done! You've configured some charts to query real subscription data from New Relic's database. Populate charts with pageView event data Consider the remaining charts that still use mock data: Total unsubscriptions per version Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions Version A - Page views Version B - Page views Past tests Some of these charts need to show page view data. Fortunately, your demo application creates a custom event for every page view like it does for subscriptions! Since Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions require data from two sources, ignore these for now and focus on Version A - Page views and Version B - Page views. Step 1 of 2 In page-views.js, remove the mock data from VersionPageViews and use a NrqlQuery component to supply a query: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 2 of 2 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: In these new queries, you fetch pageView custom events instead of subscription events. You also use a WHERE clause to filter to a particular page_version rather than a FACET to group by page_version. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Phew, that's a lot of queries, but your application looks great! You're now showing real data in four charts. Remember the two charts you ignored because they require data from two sources? Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions You have to handle these differently than you did for the charts you've been dealing with because NRQL has no method for querying data from multiple sources. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to supply data to these two charts. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize NRQL data, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { this[index] = { endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, } }, data ) historicalData.data = data return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data, format it according to the TableChart specifications, and set it on historicalData.data. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorage from your nerdlet, before starting this one. Throughout this course, you're building a New Relic One application that gathers telemetry data from a demo web service that's running an A/B test on a newsletter signup form. The purpose of your New Relic One application is to help you understand how design changes impact the number of high quality newsletter subscriptions your service gets. The business objective, to increase your service's high quality newsletter subscriptions, relies primarily on three key pieces of information: Number of page views per version Number of subscriptions per version Number of cancellations Cancellations are important because if one design version of your newsletter signup form results in a high number of subscriptions but also a high number of cancellations, then those subscriptions are not as valuable. In previous lessons, you gathered data for page views and subscriptions from New Relic's database (NRDB), but you still need cancellation data. Your demo application does not report cancellation data to New Relic, so you need to fetch that data from an external source. We've provided a service at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations to return fake cancellation data for the purposes of this course. If you visit this URL in your browser, you'll see a brief message: \"Unauthorized\". This is because we created this service with a requirement that whoever requests its data must pass an Authorization header with the bearer token ABC123. So before you can request cancellation data from api.nerdsletter.net, you need to implement a few new behaviors in your application: Provide a mechanism for inputting an authorization token Persist the authorization token in a secure data store To input your authorization token, you'll use a Modal with a TextField. The secure data store you'll use is called NerdStorageVault. It's different from NerdStorage, which you used in the last lesson, because it only supports user storage and encrypts its data. Store your API token Step 1 of 3 Change to the add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 3 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, initialize state in AbTestNerdletNerdlet with a null token default: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Your Nerdlet uses this token state to manage the authorization token you'll later pass to the third-party service. However, a component's state is not a long-term solution for data management. For that, you need NerdStorageVault. Step 3 of 3 Implement a method, called storeToken(), which mutates NerdStorageVault data, and bind that method to the AbTestNerdletNerdlet instance: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy When you call storeToken() with a new token value, your Nerdlet uses NerdGraph APIs to mutate NerdStorageVault data for the api_token key. If the request to NerdGraph is successful, storeToken() updates state.token so that the new token is locally accessible. Unlike NerdStorage, which has query and mutation components for your convenience, NerdStorageVault has no components in the SDK. Instead, you have to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to interact with it Important It's important to remember that NerdStorageVault is limited to the user scope. Any other users of your New Relic One application will have their own NerdStorageVault data. This means that even other users on your account will need to enter their token separately. Query your API token Step 1 of 2 First, create methods and state to show and hide your API token prompt: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy state.hideTokenPrompt determines whether or not the prompt is visible. Now, you need a mechanism for revealing the prompt, which is hidden by default. Step 2 of 2 Query NerdStorageVault for your api_token: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, in componentDidMount(), you've queried NerdGraph for your api_token data. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that's called when your component is mounted in the component tree. This means that early in it's setup process, your application will request your api_token. If the NerdGraph query responds successfully with your token from NerdStorageVault, it sets the token in state. Otherwise, it shows the prompt so that you can enter a token. This is great for storing an initial token, but what if you enter the wrong token or the API changes? You need a way reveal the prompt on-demand. Next, you'll create the actual token prompt and a button to manually invoke the prompt. Create your token prompt Step 1 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named token-prompt.js: bash Copy $ touch token-prompt.js Step 2 of 9 In this new file, create a button that allows you to enter a new token on demand: import React from 'react'; import { Button } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenButton receives showPrompt() in its props and calls that method when its Button is clicked. Step 3 of 9 Create a token prompt using a Modal with a TextField: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenPrompt renders a Modal with a TextField, a Button, and an explanatory prompt. You use the Modal to enter your API token. It also provides basic error handling if you try to submit the form with no token value. It's important to distinguish the token in AbTestNerdletNerdlet.state and the token in ApiTokenPrompt.state. The token in your Nerdlet's state is the current token that your Nerdlet knows about. It's this token that matches what's in NerdStorageVault. The token in ApiTokenPrompt.state is a fluid value that changes as you update the text in the TextField. When you press Submit in the modal, ApiTokenPrompt submits its token to your Nerdlet's storeToken() method. Then, storeToken() mutates NerdStorageVault with the new token. You also implemented a few methods to improve the user experience: keyPress() submits the token when the RETURN key is pressed showTokenError() and hideTokenError() remind the user that they must enter a token before submitting the form Step 4 of 9 Export your components, so you can use them in your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } export { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import ApiTokenButton and ApiTokenPrompt and add them to render(): import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; import { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } from './token-prompt'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you visit your application for the first time, the prompt is automatically revealed. Enter \"ABC123\" in the TextField, as that's the token that the third-party service expects. Once you submit your token and your Nerdlet hides the prompt, click Update API token at the bottom of your New Relic One application to reveal it again: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Pass your API token to TotalCancellations Step 1 of 3 In index.js, pass the API token to TotalCancellations so you're prepared to make a request to the third-party service: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests';

} } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <TotalCancellations token={this.state.token} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 2 of 3 In total-cancellations.js, log the token to your browser console: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { lastToken: null } } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) this.setState({lastToken: this.props.token}) } } render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy Here, you've implemented another React lifecycle method, called componentDidUpdate(). Now, every time your Nerdlet's state.token changes, TotalCancellations gets a new token prop, which triggers componentDidUpdate(). In componentDidUpdate(), you check that the incoming token is not the same as the last token it knew about, which is stored in local state. If the incoming token is different, you log a message with the new token and update state.lastToken. This logic prepares your code for a future change to use your API token in a request to a third-party service. Step 3 of 3 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see the log from TotalCancellations in your browser's console: If you change your token, you'll see another log from TotalCancellations with your updated token. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now you know how to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to manage data in NerdStorageVault! Remember, use NerdStorage for your New Relic One application's non-sensitive data and NerdStorageVault for the sensitive stuff like tokens, passwords, and other secrets. As a bonus, you created a way to manage your token in NerdStorageVault from the user interface. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component for later use. Whether it's been with NrqlQuery, AccountStorageQuery, AccountStorageMutation, NerdGraphQuery, or NerdGraphMutation, you've learned several ways to interact with New Relic data in your New Relic One application. But New Relic One applications aren't just another way to show New Relic data. The purpose of New Relic One applications is to show you how your software is helping you meet your business objectives. Sometimes, New Relic data is all you need to make that happen, but other times you need to look beyond New Relic for data to fill in the gaps. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Fetch data from a third-party service.",

Before you build your New Relic One application, you need to spin up your demo services. This coursework depends on two important services: A web service that shows a newsletter signup form. The form's heading text alternates between two versions because you're performing an A/B test to determine which text leads to more high-quality subscriptions. A simulator service that sends steady traffic to the website so that you don't have to manually generate data To spin up your demo services, you first need to install Docker and Docker compose. Spin up your demo services Step 1 of 5 Clone the coursework repository from GitHub: bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course This repository contains code for creating NodeJS New Relic automations. It also contains a an app code directory for each lesson in the course. You'll use these directories to follow along with the course content. Step 2 of 5 Change to the demo directory, called ab-test-app: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/ab-test-app This directory contains configuration files and READMEs for using the demo. Step 3 of 5 Build and run the web service and simulator containers, using docker-compose: bash Copy $ NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=<your New Relic license key> docker-compose up -d Important Make sure you replace <your New Relic license key> with your actual license key. Once it's finished, view the website at localhost:3001: Step 4 of 5 Visit New Relic, and navigate to APM in the top navigation menu. Select Newsletter from the list of instrumented services: You may have to wait a minute or two for New Relic to recieve data from your demo services. Once it's ready, you'll see transaction data, such as performance, throughput, and an Apdex score: Step 5 of 5 To spin down your demo services, run docker-compose down from your ab-test-app directory: bash Copy $ docker-compose down Now you're ready to build your New Relic One application!

You can also provide access to your Nerdlet from an entity in your account. In this guide, you'll learn how to attach your Nerdlet to your entities. Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install and configure the New Relic One CLI Create a Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 Create a Nerdpack with the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name entity-nerdlet This results in a Nerdpack, called entity-nerdlet, which consists of a launcher, called entity-nerdlet-launcher, and a Nerdlet, called entity-nerdlet-nerdlet. Step 2 of 4 Serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ cd entity-nerdlet $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 4 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and navigate to Apps: ?nerdpacks=local is required to enable your locally served Nerdpacks to load in New Relic. Step 4 of 4 Under Your apps, click your launcher to view your New Relic One application: Attach your Nerdlet to entities You've seen how you can access your Nerdlet from a launcher. Now, access your Nerdlet from your entities. Step 1 of 6 From inside your Nerdpack's root directory, open nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json. This is your Nerdlet's metadata file. You'll use this file to attach your Nerdlet to entities. Step 2 of 6 Add a context object with an entities array: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [] 8 } 9 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy This tells New Relic that you want to surface your Nerdlet in an array of entity contexts. Step 3 of 6 Add an entity context: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [ 8 { 9 \"domain\": \"APM\", 10 \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" 11 } 12 ] 13 } 14 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Here, you've attached your Nerdlet to all application entities in the APM domain. Step 4 of 6 Go to APM: Because you're serving your Nerdpack locally, remember that you must still specify the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 5 of 6 Choose any of your applications: Step 6 of 6 Scroll down to see your Nerdlet attached to the application: Click this menu option and see your Nerdlet the same way you did with the launcher. Configure your entities context The context.entities key in your Nerdlet's nr1.json file specifies which entities your Nerdlet should be attached to. Specify an entity domain Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity domain by specifying the domain as one of the following values: APM: Application Performance Monitoring BROWSER: Browser INFRA: Infrastructure monitoring MOBILE: Mobile monitoring SYNTH: Synthetic monitoring For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities in the APM domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those in a domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"!APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities in multiple domains: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" }] } } Copy Specify an entity type Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity type by specifying the type as one of the following values: APPLICATION HOST MONITOR For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities of the APPLICATION type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those of a specified type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"!APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity whose type matches one of an array of types: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }, { \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }] } } Copy Specify entity tags Attach your Nerdlet to entities that have a given tag. For example, attach your Nerdlet to the entity which has a particular GUID: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"guid\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ENTITY GUID>\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity which has particular accountId and uses the Python programming language: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"accountId\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ACCOUNT ID>\"] }, { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Combine filters When you filter the entities to which your Nerdlet will be added, you can combine domain, type, and tags: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"domain\": \"APM\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\", \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] }, { \"domain\": \"SYNTH\", \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" } ] } } Copy In this example, you've attached your Nerdlet to: All APM applications whose metadata tags specify the python language AND all Synthetic monitors AND all Browser entities",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Install and configure the New Relic One CLI, before starting this one. A Nerdpack is a package that contains all the files that make up a New Relic One application or visualization. Nerdpacks include files for metadata, Nerdlets, assets, and more. To create a Nerdpack, use the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack When nr1 prompts for a component name, use \"ab-test\" and watch the tool create the foundations of your Nerdpack. Once it's finished, explore the files it created for you. Root directory At the root level, you have a directory called ab-test. Everything inside this directory is part of the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls ab-test README.md nerdlets nr1.json package.json launchers node_modules package-lock.json Readme.md provides instructions for creating Nerdpack elements and serving your application locally. This and nr1 --help are useful if you forget how to interact with your Nerdpack using the command line tool. Javascript files package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules are important for running your JavaScript application, but aren't unique to Nerdpacks. You can learn about these modules from JavaScript courses should you need to tweak them. For now, take a look at nr1.json, one of the most relevant files in this directory. Metadata file nr1.json is the Nerdpack's metadata file, containing a schema type, unique identifier, a display name, and a description. Since you’re building a New Relic One application for running and analyzing A/B tests, update the package's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and set the description to \"A/B test your application using New Relic One\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"311bcd0c-f7eb-4285-afed-4219179bf91d\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"A/B test your application using New Relic One.\" } nr1.json Copy It's good to describe your application's purpose, especially if you're going to publish your application for others to use. Next, look at the launchers and nerdlets subdirectories. Launchers launchers is a directory because you can create multiple launchers for your New Relic One application. nr1 create only created one launcher for your Nerdpack and called it \"ab-test-launcher\". Inside its directory, there are two files: icon.png is an image that represents the application nr1.json is the launcher's metadata file Use \"A/B Test Launcher\" for the launcher's displayName and \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\" for the description in nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"ab-test-launcher\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test Launcher\", \"description\": \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\" } launchers/ab-test-launcher/nr1.json Copy Notice that the launcher has a rootNerdletId. This identifies the Nerdlet that the launcher opens when it's selected. This Nerdpack has only one Nerdlet, called ab-test-nerdlet, but some Nerdpacks may have multiple. Make sure that you set the rootNerdletId to the Nerdlet you want the launcher to open. Nerdlets The nerdlets directory contains all the Nerdlets that make up your New Relic One application. Since ab-test-nerdlet is the only Nerdlet in this Nerdpack, there is only one subdirectory. In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, there are three files: index.js is the JavaScript file that contains your Nerdlet component styles.scss holds the Sass stylesheet for your Nerdlet nr1.json contains the Nerdlet's metadata Update your Nerdlet's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and description to \"Control and view results of your A/B test\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"Control and view results of your A/B test\" } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Now, you've customized your Nerdpack, Nerdlet, and launcher with informative display names and descriptions, but what does your application actually do? Check out index.js to see what your default Nerdlet looks like: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, ab-test-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you have AbTestNerdletNerdlet, which nr1 created for you. It's a React component that renders a first-level welcome heading. Because this is the root Nerdlet, as specified in your launcher's nr1.json file, when you click on your launcher in the New Relic platform, the launcher will open a view that displays this heading. Tip In this lesson, you used nr1 create to create a Nerdpack, complete with a launcher and a Nerdlet. If you want to create another Nerdlet or Launcher in your Nerdpack, you can also do that with nr1 create: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdlet $ nr1 create --type launcher You can even skip the --type flag and select an option from a list: bash Copy $ nr1 create ? What kind of component do you want to create? › - Use arrow-keys.

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] }, \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Alerts & AI. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Create a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add chart headings, before starting this one. With your charts organized and descriptive headings above each one, your New Relic One application is becoming more usable. In this lesson, you'll continue that trend by creating descriptions for each design version in your A/B test. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-version-descriptions/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-version-descriptions/ab-test Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named description.js: bash Copy $ touch description.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a new React component, called VersionDescription, which uses a HeadingText and a BlockText to render a version description that you pass, using the description prop: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, HeadingText } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionDescription extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return ( <div> <HeadingText className=\"versionHeader\"> Version {this.props.version} </HeadingText> <BlockText className=\"versionText\"> {this.props.description} </BlockText> </div> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/description.js Copy You'll use this one class to create a version description for each design version in your A/B test. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import VersionDescription, create descriptions for each design version, and create a new GridItem component for each design version: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you've created two VersionDescription components. You passed the description and version props, which correspond to a design version. You also added a horizontal rule to visually separate the descriptions from the charts in your app. For this, you added a GridItem with a columnSpan of 12, to stretch the rule the full width of the grid. Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-version-descriptions/ab-test.

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Step 1. Add SCIM/SSO application Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. Add the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to your list of applications. Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by Organization. Click on Add. Continue with the following section to connect the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to New Relic. Step 2. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 3. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 4. Assign users and groups After the New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration and the New Relic side configuration is finished, you can assign users and groups to the application. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on Users and groups in the sidebar. Click +Add user. From the Add Assignment page, click on Users and groups, and select the appropriate users or groups that you'd like to provision. Then click Select and Assign. The selected users and groups appear on the Users and groups page, indicating that they're candidates for provisioning. Repeat the steps to add users and groups until all desired entities have been assigned to the application. What's next? When you're done importing users, here are some potential next steps: Users created via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Persist the selected version, before starting this one. In this tutorial, you're building an A/B test application. The application surfaces data about an ongoing A/B test on your website, which you then use to decide which page design version is most effective at engaging users. As part of that overarching goal, you're building a section which allows you to end the test by deciding a winner of the experiment: Unfortunately, there are a few issues with the code and design for this section. By the end of this course, pressing End test will tell your website's backend server that every customer should see the version selected here. This is destructive behavior because it makes an irreversible change to your website. To account for the desctructiveness of pressing End test, you need to modify some features of your application: Make the button look important to catch your eye Prompt yourself with a confirmation message before ending the test to ensure you don't end it prematurely Show and hide your confirmation modal Step 1 of 12 Change to the present-confirmation-modal/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test This directory contains the code your application should have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 12 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, update the Button to use the DESTRUCTIVE styling: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Tip Read more about Button and its props on the New Relic developer site. Step 3 of 12 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test. Step 4 of 12 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 12 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 12 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: Now you've styled your button to convey its destructive consequences, but that's not enough to prevent you from accidentally clicking it. Next, you create a shield for your website's backend. This extra layer of protection requires you to confirm that you intend to end the test before actually doing so. Step 7 of 12 Add a Modal to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Your new modal contains a heading, a confirmation message, the winning design version, and two buttons. You'll explore some of these components later in this course. With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your new Modal: Tip Remember, while your server is running, it will update automatically when you save your code. The modal looks great, but it has three issues: It was present before you clicked End test You can't dismiss it It always says you selected \"Version A\", even if you didn't In the following steps, you'll correct all three of these issues. Step 8 of 12 In EndTestButton, initialize state with a value for modalHidden: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy modalHidden determines whether or not to hide the modal. The default value of modalHidden is true because you only want to show the modal when you select End test. Step 9 of 12 Supply modalHidden to the Modal: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy First, you've created a constructor to accept component props. This provides your component access to the modalHidden prop that you passed in EndTestSection. Then you provide the value of modalHidden to the Modal component's hidden prop. Tip Read more about Modal and its props on the New Relic developer site. Step 10 of 12 Add and bind two new methods to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Use closeModal and showModal to close and show your modal, respectively, depending on how a user interacts with the modal. Step 11 of 12 Show the modal when you click End test: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you've supplied showModal() as the callback for the Button component's onClick event. Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. The modal is hidden by default. Click End test to see the modal. Step 12 of 12 Close the modal from the Modal component's onClose callback and from the Yes, end test and No, continue test buttons: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Click End test. The modal opens and displays your confirmation message. Close the modal by clicking X at the top right, either of its buttons, or even in the dark space to its left. Notice that the modal says you chose \"Version A\", even if you choose \"Version B\". This is because \"Version A\" is hardcoded in the Modal text. Next, you'll make that dynamic. Use the version you selected in your modal Step 1 of 2 In EndTestSection, pass selectedVersion to the EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Now, you can access the selected version from the EndTestButton component's props. Step 2 of 2 Use selectedVersion in your confirmation message: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Select \"Version B\" from the menu. Click End test to see \"Version B\" in the confirmation modal: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Congratulations! You've done a lot of work and it shows in the usefulness of your application. You've created charts that show mocked data. You've organized your charts into a readable structure. You've added an interface for your users to interact with the test. Now, you need some real data. In the next lesson, you'll replace the mocked data in your charts with real data from your backend service. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Add NrqlQuery components to your nerdlet.",

      "body": "The second version of our StatsD integration was released on May 25 2020. It's an improvement on our first StatsD integration. Improvements include: simpler configuration, and a simpler method for adding tags (key-value pairs). Features Our StatsD integration (version 2) lets you easily get StatsD-format data into New Relic. You can also add any arbitrary tags (key-value pairs) to your data. Once your metrics are in New Relic, you can query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Requirements This integration uses our Metric API and our Event API to ingest data. To use these APIs, you'll need an Insert API key. The integration adheres to the Metric API requirements and data limits. The default rate limit is 100,000 data points per minute (DPM). If you think you're missing metrics or sending more than 100K DPM, see Request data changes. To see if your account is hitting the rate limit, run the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature ='Metrics' FACET category, message LIMIT 100 since 1 day ago Copy Install This section will explain how to do a standard install. If you want to run StatsD in Kubernetes, see Kubernetes install. To install the StatsD integration, run the following command and include your New Relic account ID and New Relic Insert API key. This generates a TOML configuration file used by gostatsd. docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy If your account is in the EU data center region, add this to the above command: -e NR_EU_REGION=true \\ Copy After installing, you can: Do optional additional configuration Define your metrics Add custom tags to your data Create alerts Install for Kubernetes Here are examples of Kubernetes manifests for deployment and service objects: Kubernetes manifest examples Below are examples of Kubernetes manifests to deploy StatsD in a Kubernetes environment and create a StatsD service named newrelic-statsd. You need to insert your account ID and your license key. deployment.yml: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: selector: matchLabels: app: newrelic-statsd replicas: 2 revisionHistoryLimit: 2 template: metadata: labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: containers: - name: newrelic-statsd image: newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 env: - name: NR_ACCOUNT_ID value: \"NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID\" - name: NR_API_KEY value: \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy service.yml: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: newrelic-statsd namespace: tooling labels: app: newrelic-statsd spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: newrelic-statsd port: 80 targetPort: 8125 protocol: UDP selector: app: newrelic-statsd Copy For configuration details, see Kubernetes configuration. Configure In the install procedure, you run nri-statsd with environment variables, and this generates a TOML configuration file. Additionally, you can set these configuration options: Configuration options Description expiry-interval string If a metric is not updated for this amount of time, we stop reporting that metric. Default is 5m. If you want to send the metrics only if the value was updated between the flush intervals, configure this to 1ms. To never expire metrics, set it to 0. percent-threshold list of integers Specifies the percentiles used for metrics aggregation. Default: 90. metrics-addr string Indicates address on which to listen for metrics. Default: :8125. Tip To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the StatsD integration you must define the following endpoints in the custom configuration: address = 'https://gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/ $NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' Copy address-metrics = 'https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' Copy Here are some examples of customizing configuration by overwriting the default configuration: Example of custom configuration # Specify after how long do we expire metrics, default:5m expiry-interval = '1ms' # percent-threshold specify a list of percentiles for metrics aggregation, default:90 percent-threshold = [90, 99] backends='newrelic' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$NR_ACCOUNT_ID/events' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy Disable timer sub-metrics: By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. If you want to disable those metrics you can do it by adding a disabled-sub-metrics configuration section and set true for the ones you want disabled. Here's an example: # disabled-sub-metrics configuration section allows disabling timer sub-metrics [disabled-sub-metrics] # Regular metrics count=false count-per-second=false mean=false median=false lower=false upper=false stddev=false sum=false sum-squares=false # Percentile metrics count-pct=false mean-pct=false sum-pct=false sum-squares-pct=false lower-pct=false upper-pct=false Copy Docker: overwrite default configuration To overwrite the default nri-statsd configuration while running in a container, you can mount a configuration file inside the container. You can adopt the following template as needed for your situation. Example: backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address-metrics = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = 'NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To run the container with the file mounted in the appropriate path: docker run \\ ... -v ${PWD}/nri-statsd.toml:/etc/opt/newrelic/nri-statsd.toml \\ ... newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Kubernetes: overwrite default configuration The best approach to configure nri-statsd running in Kubernetes is to use a configMap and mount the configMap into the container. (This is a similar process to mounting the configuration file in Docker.) Example: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-statsd-config namespace: default data: nri-statsd.toml: | backends='newrelic' flush-interval='10s' [newrelic] # flush types supported: metrics, insights, infra flush-type = 'metrics' transport = 'default' address = 'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1' api-key = '$NEW_RELIC_API_KEY' Copy To use the configMap, declare a volume on your deployment spec template and then declare a volumeMount on your container spec. Example: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment spec: template: spec: containers: .... volumeMounts: - mountPath: /etc/opt/newrelic/ name: nri-statsd-config volumes: - name: nri-statsd-config configMap: name: nri-statsd-config Copy Metric format The integration receives metrics using the StatsD protocol. Optionally, the sample rate can be configured and tags can be added. Here's the metric data format we use: <metric name>:<value>|<type>|@<sample rate>|#<tags> Copy Here are explanations of these fields: Field name Description < metric name> string Required. Name of the metric. < value> string Required. The metric type: c = counter g = gauge ms = timer @ < sample rate> float Optional for simple counters or timer counters. When many metrics must be sent, you can use sampling to reduce network traffic. The downside is a reduction in the resolution of the data. An example of how this would work for sample rates below 1: If you set this to 0.1, the counter would send a measurement one out of every 10 times. # < tags> string Optional. Tags attached to your metrics are converted into attributes (key-value pairs). For more on tagging options, see Tags. Metric types Here are the types of metrics and how to format them: Counter A counter measures the number of occurrences of an event. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. A counter can be incremented or decremented during the same flush interval by adding a sign to the value. In the following example, the counter value will be 2: counter:4|c counter:-2|c Copy At each flush, the current count is sent and reset to 0. If the count is not updated, at the next flush it will send the value 0. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Here’s an example of a counter that is being sampled 1 out of 10 times: counter:4|c@0.1 Copy Gauge A gauge represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include temperature, CPU usage, and memory. Here's an example: temperature:40|g Copy If the gauge is not updated, at the next flush it will send the previous value. You can opt to disable this behavior by setting expiry-interval to 1ms. Timer The timer metric type measures timing data. By default, nri_statsd calculates the following for timer metrics: standard deviation, mean, median, sum, lower, and upper bounds for the flush interval. These are sent as sub-metrics in the following format: <metric_base_name>.std_dev <metric_base_name>.median <metric_base_name>.summary <metric_base_name>.sum_squares <metric_base_name>.mean <metric_base_name>.per_second Copy The configured percentiles will generate the following metrics. The percentile threshold value will be attached as a tag. <metric_base_name>.sum_squares.percentiles <metric_base_name>.sum.percentiles <metric_base_name>.count.percentiles <metric_base_name>.upper.percentiles <metric_base_name>.mean.percentiles Copy The percentile threshold can be tweaked with the percent-threshold config option. These can be controlled through the disabled-sub-metrics configuration section. Add tags (attributes) You can add tags to your data, which we save as attributes (key-value pairs). There are two options for adding tags: Add default tags that apply to all metrics: These apply to all metrics. They are fixed and don't change over time. Add metric-level tags: These apply to specific metrics and allow the value to be changed between two submits. Add default tags that apply to all metrics Add tags to metrics and events by defining an environment variable in the startup command. Here's an example that would create two tags: -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" Copy Here's that environment variable used in the startup command: docker run \\ -d --restart unless-stopped \\ --name newrelic-statsd \\ -h $(hostname) \\ -e NR_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ -e NR_API_KEY=YOUR_INSERT_API_KEY \\ -e TAGS=\"environment:production region:us\" \\ -p 8125:8125/udp \\ newrelic/nri-statsd:2.0.0 Copy Add metric-level tags When defining the metric format, you can add tags using this format: <bucket name>:<value>|<type>|#<tags> Copy In this example, <tags> is a comma-separated list of tags. Tags format is: simple or key:value. Here's an example NRQL query that includes a custom tag: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE environment = 'production' Copy Create alerts You can alert on StatsD data using NRQL alert conditions. Alert example This procedure walks you through sending some sample data and then creating an alert condition using that data. First, send this data to New Relic’s StatsD container: echo \"prod.test.num:32|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Next, create a NRQL alert condition using this query: SELECT latest(prod.test.num) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'prod.test.num' Copy Here's an image showing creating this NRQL alert condition. Notice that the sample data sent in is represented by the blue dot on the upper right of the chart. Now we can create the alert condition with these settings: Remember to set the Condition name. If a metric with a value above 50 is sent, then an incident is created and notified. The incident is closed automatically after 24 hours. To test that the alert is working, run this command: echo \"prod.test.num:60|g\" | nc -v -w 1 -u localhost 8125 Copy Find and use data To query your data, you'd use any New Relic query option. For example, you might run a NRQL query like: SELECT count(*) FROM Metric WHERE metricName = 'myMetric' and environment = 'production' Copy For more on how to query the Metric data type, see Query metric data.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add your first chart, before starting this one. You’ve begun building your A/B test application. So far, it consists of a single line chart, which represents the number of subscriptions your newsletter receives from each version of your website. To understand what you’ll build in this lesson, review the design guide to remember what charts come next: In the design, there are two pie charts beneath the line chart that you’ve already created. One represents the distribution of users who receive version A and version B. The other represents the distribution of successful requests from users who got version A and version B. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-pie-charts/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add two new Javascript files: total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js bash Copy $ touch total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js Step 3 of 9 In total-subscriptions.js, create a component, called TotalSubscriptions, which renders mocked subscription data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Notice that the series data is formatted differently for PieChart than it was for LineChart. Because PieChart uses unidimensional data, its series only take y-values. Step 4 of 9 In total-cancellations.js, create a component, called TotalCancellations, which renders mocked cancellation data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new components and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test.

When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Your application is starting to take shape. You’ve created a line chart and two pie charts. For now, these charts use mocked data, but you’ll provide them real data in a later lesson. Before you focus on the data in your charts, however, you’ll learn how to add a table to your application so you can visualize data in a new way.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add tables, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you added a variety of charts to your A/B test application. These charts presented different facets of information about your A/B test, and they behaved independently from one other. In this lesson, you’ll create a new pair of line charts and learn how to synchronize their behaviors. Before you write any new code, consult your design guide to understand the role that these new charts will play in your application: In the design guide, there is a line graph under each of the tables you created in the last lesson. These line graphs show the version-specific response times for newsletter signup requests. Now, you’ll build two more line charts, but this time, you’ll group them with a ChartGroup and specify that their values are measured in milliseconds. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-a-chart-group/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named page-views.js: bash Copy $ touch page-views.js Step 3 of 9 In this new file, create a component called VersionPageViews to hold a LineChart, which shows the number of times a page is viewed: import React from 'react'; import { LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Notice the new attribute in the series' metadata fields: units_data. This attribute describes the unit type for a specified data axis. In this case, you set the unit type for the y axis to 'MS', which stands for milliseconds. Other options for unit types, include: 'PERCENTAGE', 'TIMESTAMP', and 'BYTES_PER_SECOND'. Step 4 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In index.js, import ChartGroup from nr1 and group your VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <ChartGroup> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </ChartGroup> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Because the tables are conceptually related, as they show contrasting performance metrics over the same timeslice, it makes sense to group them in a ChartGroup. This means that the two charts behave synchronously. For example, when you hover over one chart, the other chart shows a hover indicator at the same x coordinate. Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the LineChart components synchronized in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Tip Each of the chart component types you've used in this lesson have had different series configurations. Most chart components share the same metadata attributes, like LineChart and PieChart, but differ in their data formats. It's helpful to be aware of the different data formats, for when you create your own charts. You can read more about the data formats in the chart component documentation. Now your application is filled with charts, but it doesn't look great. The charts are stacked on top of one another in an unhelpful way. In the next lesson, you'll learn about the user interface components from the SDK and how you can use them to organize your charts.

Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID $ npm install # Install dependencies $ nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, you should see a Create a table launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet subdirectory and open the index.js file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component. Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows. As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells. The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done! Keep exploring the Table components, their properties, and how to use them, in our SDK documentation.",

Change the appearance of your chart When you run your query in advanced (NRQL) mode or view your chart while using basic mode to specify data, the query builder analyzes your data and applies a chart type that fits your data. For some queries, you'll have several options of chart types to choose from. To change chart type, use the Chart type menu to the right of the current chart. Each type in the list has a tooltip with information about using that type. Example of the chart type menu, showing a tooltip. Customize your charts While we try our best to optimize how we display your data, sometimes you may have other needs. To this end, you can customize charts to display information at your convenience. Tip Customizations are available depending on the chart type. Format date and time Tip For table and billboard charts. Customize the date and time format for tables and billboards: for each type of data, you can select if you want to leave it as it is, or modify the format as Numeric or Date. If data is a timestamp, you can choose how to represent the date and time: For numbers, select if you want us to auto-format them, or chose the number of decimals you want to see. Customize the Y axis Tip For line and area charts. On line charts and area charts you can adjust the Y axis to display the data within certain values by setting a minimum and maximum value for the axis.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the New Relic One catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published to the catalog, you can view it by visiting the Apps page of New Relic: From the catalog UI, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top right of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app in the catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add navigation to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you finished the A/B test application you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to prepare it for publication. When you publish your app to the New Relic One catalog, users can view it and subscribe to it. You can help your users by showing and telling them what the app does, how to use it, and more. Create catalog information To supply information to the catalog about your app, you need to create the catalog directory in your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 6 Change to the describe-app/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test Step 2 of 6 Create the catalog directory: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog This creates a catalog directory with template files for inputting custom information about your app. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog directory. Step 3 of 6 Update catalog/documentation.md: ## Documentation This application combines and presents data from New Relic and the Nerdsletter API so that we can make an informed decision on which design version results in more high-quality newsletter subscriptions. It also presents an button to end the test, which saves the date and version descriptions in local storage. We can use this app for future A/B tests as well! catalog/documentation.md Copy For this course, you're keeping the documentation concise by merely describing what the app does. In your own projects, you might also include instructions for contributing to the project in an open source context, installing the app's dependencies, or anything else that might help a user navigate complexities in your app or code. Step 4 of 6 Update catalog/config.json: { \"tagline\": \"Win @ newsletter subscriptions\", \"details\": \"Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course\", \"whatsNew\": \"Initial release! Includes:\\n- A variety of charts for understanding the test results\\n- An end test button for storing some test data in a table\", \"support\": { \"email\": { \"address\": \"\" }, \"issues\": { \"url\": \"\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"\" } } } catalog/config.json Copy Here, you've specified a tagline, project details, the source code repository, and a short list of everything included in the initial release. In other projects, you might also add a support email or support links. Step 5 of 6 Save the this screenshot to your catalog/screenshots directory. Users will be able to see a carousel of screenshots in your app's About page in the catalog. Step 6 of 6 Save the following icon as icon.png in two places: nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test/launchers/ab-test-launcher This will act as the launcher's icon and the app's catalog icon on the About page. Now you've added documentation, screenshots, metadata, and an icon to your app so that users will be able to understand what it does and why they might need it. For now, these files are all local and they need to be submitted to the catalog. But before you can do that, your app, itself, needs to be published to the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll publish your app, submit your catalog information, and view the results in New Relic.

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Alerts & AI. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Create a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Product-based pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The pricing edition (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher editions give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (learn more). The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The total number of provisioned full users (users with access to everything available at that edition). Basic users are free. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the Billing user role. For users on the original user model, this requires an Owner or Admin role. For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. You can also do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Other user-related billing details: You can see your full user count in the UI. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a subscription term and/or when a user is provisioned as full user or switched to a full user. A user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For organizations that have multiple accounts, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you may not see the complete user count for that organization. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition for Full Stack Observability, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise Full Stack Observability editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special non-profit pricing, go to newrelic.org and apply. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the New Relic One catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in the catalog Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the New Relic One app catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Apps: From here, you can see your application under New Relic One catalog: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots... ✔ Screenshots uploaded ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release! Includes: - A variety of charts for understanding the test r... whatsNew.version: 1.0.0 All the information from catalog shows here. Step 3 of 3 View your app in the catalog: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public New Relic One catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Subscribe to your New Relic One application.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you used PlatformStateContext from the New Relic One SDK to look up the time range that the user selected from the app's time picker. Now, you'll learn about another component that interacts with the New Relic platform: navigation. The navigation component lets you open entities, navigate to entities, and build Location objects for entities from your Nerdlet. You can also use navigation for other Nerdlets and launchers. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-navigation/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In newsletter-signups.js, create a new method, called NewsletterSignups.openApmEntity(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. This method uses navigation.openStackedEntity() to display your demo application's APM entity in a stacked view. Notice openApmEntity() requires your ENTITY_GUID. You need to locate that ID and store it in a constant. Step 3 of 10 Navigate to APM: See metadata for your Newsletter service: Copy the entity's GUID: Create an ENTITY_GUID constant: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and the entity GUID you just copied, respectively. Now, openApmEntity() knows what entity to show. Next, you need to create a button to invoke this method. Step 4 of 10 Create a button to show your APM entity: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you've created a button and configured it to call openApmEntity() when it's clicked. Step 5 of 10 Import Stack and StackItem: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. You'll use Stack and StackItem to lay out the button on the far right side of the same row that the HeadingText is on. Step 6 of 10 Lay out the Stack: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <Stack fullWidth> <StackItem grow={true}> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> </StackItem> <StackItem> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> </StackItem> </Stack> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you used a full-width Stack to set up the layout for the row. To make the HeadingText fill the entire row except the width of the button, you used the StackItem.grow prop. Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. Click App performance: Now you see the stacked entity: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively Congratulations! You're finished writing all the code you'll write for your New Relic One A/B test application. Now, you have an application reporting New Relic data from your demo service that is running an A/B test. You've created several charts, buttons, and other UI elements. And you've organized your components into a readable and usable view. On top of the visuals, you've supplied data to your charts from multiple data sources in and outside of New Relic. You've created some backend functionality which utilizes your New Relic One application's own data store. You've also utilized the platform APIs for interacting with platform UI and showing a stacked entity view. You've really accomplished a lot throughout this course, so far. There are only a few things left to do! First, is to learn how to publish and subscribe to your New Relic One application so that it can run on our platform instead of your own local server. Second, is to learn how to deal with some common issues you might see in New Relic One application development.

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Alerts & AI. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Create a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Product-based pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The pricing edition (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher editions give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (learn more). The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The total number of provisioned full users (users with access to everything available at that edition). Basic users are free. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the Billing user role. For users on the original user model, this requires an Owner or Admin role. For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. You can also do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Other user-related billing details: You can see your full user count in the UI. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a subscription term and/or when a user is provisioned as full user or switched to a full user. A user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For organizations that have multiple accounts, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you may not see the complete user count for that organization. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition for Full Stack Observability, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise Full Stack Observability editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special non-profit pricing, go to newrelic.org and apply. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "info": "Create a Nerdpack",
      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Install and configure the New Relic One CLI, before starting this one. A Nerdpack is a package that contains all the files that make up a New Relic One application or visualization. Nerdpacks include files for metadata, Nerdlets, assets, and more. To create a Nerdpack, use the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack When nr1 prompts for a component name, use \"ab-test\" and watch the tool create the foundations of your Nerdpack. Once it's finished, explore the files it created for you. Root directory At the root level, you have a directory called ab-test. Everything inside this directory is part of the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls ab-test README.md nerdlets nr1.json package.json launchers node_modules package-lock.json Readme.md provides instructions for creating Nerdpack elements and serving your application locally. This and nr1 --help are useful if you forget how to interact with your Nerdpack using the command line tool. Javascript files package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules are important for running your JavaScript application, but aren't unique to Nerdpacks. You can learn about these modules from JavaScript courses should you need to tweak them. For now, take a look at nr1.json, one of the most relevant files in this directory. Metadata file nr1.json is the Nerdpack's metadata file, containing a schema type, unique identifier, a display name, and a description. Since you’re building a New Relic One application for running and analyzing A/B tests, update the package's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and set the description to \"A/B test your application using New Relic One\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"311bcd0c-f7eb-4285-afed-4219179bf91d\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"A/B test your application using New Relic One.\" } nr1.json Copy It's good to describe your application's purpose, especially if you're going to publish your application for others to use. Next, look at the launchers and nerdlets subdirectories. Launchers launchers is a directory because you can create multiple launchers for your New Relic One application. nr1 create only created one launcher for your Nerdpack and called it \"ab-test-launcher\". Inside its directory, there are two files: icon.png is an image that represents the application nr1.json is the launcher's metadata file Use \"A/B Test Launcher\" for the launcher's displayName and \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\" for the description in nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"ab-test-launcher\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test Launcher\", \"description\": \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\" } launchers/ab-test-launcher/nr1.json Copy Notice that the launcher has a rootNerdletId. This identifies the Nerdlet that the launcher opens when it's selected. This Nerdpack has only one Nerdlet, called ab-test-nerdlet, but some Nerdpacks may have multiple. Make sure that you set the rootNerdletId to the Nerdlet you want the launcher to open. Nerdlets The nerdlets directory contains all the Nerdlets that make up your New Relic One application. Since ab-test-nerdlet is the only Nerdlet in this Nerdpack, there is only one subdirectory. In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, there are three files: index.js is the JavaScript file that contains your Nerdlet component styles.scss holds the Sass stylesheet for your Nerdlet nr1.json contains the Nerdlet's metadata Update your Nerdlet's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and description to \"Control and view results of your A/B test\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"Control and view results of your A/B test\" } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Now, you've customized your Nerdpack, Nerdlet, and launcher with informative display names and descriptions, but what does your application actually do? Check out index.js to see what your default Nerdlet looks like: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, ab-test-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you have AbTestNerdletNerdlet, which nr1 created for you. It's a React component that renders a first-level welcome heading. Because this is the root Nerdlet, as specified in your launcher's nr1.json file, when you click on your launcher in the New Relic platform, the launcher will open a view that displays this heading. Tip In this lesson, you used nr1 create to create a Nerdpack, complete with a launcher and a Nerdlet. If you want to create another Nerdlet or Launcher in your Nerdpack, you can also do that with nr1 create: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdlet $ nr1 create --type launcher You can even skip the --type flag and select an option from a list: bash Copy $ nr1 create ?

      "body": "The workload status, which is derived from the alerting status of the entities in your workload, informs you about how your workload is behaving. Why it matters Workload status: Is a quick indicator of how your system is doing, and tells you if you need to take action on any of your workloads in just a glance. Adapts to your needs and to how important each entity is. Allows you to share the status of your workloads. Other teams that depend on your services or infrastructure can learn the status of the workload without them needing to understand your system’s architecture details, or look at custom dashboards. Get started with workload status New Relic One provides a status value for all entities, which is based on the results of New Relic alerts. You can check the color-coded alert status for each entity on the New Relic Explorer, or consume the alert status value through the API. For example, you may see a red alert status indicating that a critical violation is in progress. With Workloads you can group entities that are part of a complex system and obtain a single, global value that summarizes the status of all the entities in your workload. Thus, you can quickly detect when the workload stops being operational, or anticipate any potential incident or loss of quality of service. Obtain your workload status A workload can have one of the following status values: Operational: The workload is working fine. Degraded: The workload is showing some degradation in performance or errors, but it’s still providing an acceptable level of service, and you don’t need to take any urgent action. Critical or Disrupted: The workload is not providing an acceptable level of service, and you need to take urgent action. Unknown: You haven’t configured how to calculate workload status, or there aren’t any alert conditions set up that can determine the status of the workload entities. To learn how to define or edit the workload status, refer to Workload status configuration. Save views with sets of workloads If you usually need to see the status of a certain group of workloads, you can save views that contain only those workloads. The tile view mode helps you quickly find your workloads and see their status at a glance. To create a view, follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on More > Workload views. Click on Add view. Give the view a meaningful name (such as the name of a team or business unit), and select an account to associate the view with. Select the workloads you want to include in the view, by their name or tags. Save the new view. Status views are most useful for teams that are accountable for more than one workload, support roles, and business unit managers. Get notified when the workload status changes You may need to follow the status of a workload, either because it represents the services your team is accountable for, or because your own services depend on that workload, which is managed by another team. The status of all workloads is calculated regularly and the result is stored in NRDB through a WorkloadStatus event. This allows you to set up an alert condition to notify you whenever the Workload goes into a Disrupted or Degraded status. To set up the alert condition follow these steps: Go to one.newrelic.com and select Alerts & AI. Select the policy where you want to add the new alert condition, or create a new policy with the appropriate notification channel. Then click on Create a condition. Where prompted to Select a product, click NRQL. Add the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(statusValueCode) FROM WorkloadStatus WHERE workloadGuid = '<GUID>' FACET workloadGuid as 'entity.guid', entity.name Copy You can obtain the workload GUID by clicking on the See metadata and manage tags on the workload UI. Write the WHERE clause so the alert condition applies to just one workload (as in the example) or more than one. Or remove the WHERE clause if you want the alert condition to apply to all the workloads on the account. By adding the FACET you can use these fields on the alert description, as explained below. Set one of the following static thresholds: (Recommended) Critical when the query returns a value equal to 3 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is disrupted. Critical when the query returns a value equal to 2 for at least 1 minute, if you want to be notified when the workload status is degraded. Remember that a warning threshold doesn't generate an incident or send a notification. As a result, you need to create two alert conditions with a critical threshold (as explained above) if you want to be notified of any status change. Complete the alert condition: Set a violation time limit, to automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the selected amount of time you select. Choose to fill data gaps with last known value. Optionally, you can also add a custom violation description that includes the workload name and permanent link to the UI in the alert notification: Workload: {{tag.entity.name}} Direct link: https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/{{tag.entity.guid}} Copy",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Product-based pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The pricing edition (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher editions give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (learn more). The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The total number of provisioned full users (users with access to everything available at that edition). Basic users are free. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI Your user role permissions determine whether you have the ability to edit billing-related settings.For users on the New Relic One user model, this requires the Billing user role. For users on the original user model, this requires an Owner or Admin role. For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. You can also do in-depth queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Other user-related billing details: You can see your full user count in the UI. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a subscription term and/or when a user is provisioned as full user or switched to a full user. A user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For organizations that have multiple accounts, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you may not see the complete user count for that organization. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition for Full Stack Observability, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise Full Stack Observability editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special non-profit pricing, go to newrelic.org and apply. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/Services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In Browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With Errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "When you create a dashboard, you add a variety of charts to visualize your New Relic telemetry data. These charts, offered out-of-the-box, are customizable in that you can: Resize and arrange their positions in your dashboard Update their names, display options, and underlying data queries But sometimes the charts we include in the platform aren't enough for you to get the most from your data. When you want to visualize your data in a specific way that isn't possible with our charts, you can build a custom visualization. New Relic is programmable. This means that if the platform doesn't solve your specific problem, you can write and deploy your own code to fill in some of those gaps. One area where programmability is valuable is in visualizing your data. While New Relic offers all the telemetry data that your apps and services report and provides many different kinds of charts to present that data, you might need to create something entirely unique. With the New Relic One SDK, we've provided you all the tools you'll need to create your own visualizations. Build your custom visualization With the New Relic One SDK, you can create a Nerdpack, which houses your visualization code. This code consists of a React component, logic, data queries, and external dependencies. The SDK also provides a component library that you can use to make NerdGraph requests, access platform state context, and more. Your first visualization To build your first custom visualization, install the New Relic One SDK and make sure you have the latest version: bash Copy $ nr1 update Create a Nerdpack and a visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name custom-viz ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ...my-first-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-first-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization custom-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz/visualizations/custom-viz\" The visualization you created in the my-first-viz Nerdpack contains a default component to help you get started. Serve your visualization locally: bash Copy $ cd my-first-viz $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ custom-viz https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Important To view the locally served visualization, you must use the nerdpacks=local querystring. Enter values into the fields under Configure visualization properties and see how the chart changes: Resources Here is a list of resources for building custom visualizations: Build a custom visualization for dashboards (Guide) Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK (Guide) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Customize your visualization You have a lot of control over how your visualization operates. You can choose what properties of the visualization are customizable, such as colors, sizes, and how you present your legend. You can choose whether it presents New Relic data or data from an external source. You can even install and use third-party components to create a specific look: Resources Here is a list of resources for configuring custom visualizations: Configuration options (Documentation) Customize visualizations with configuration (Guide) Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (Video) Use your custom visualization During development, you can serve your visualization locally. Under Apps > Custom Visualizations, you can view and configure your visualization to see how your data looks, but you can't instantiate that chart and use it in your account: To do that, you need to publish it to the New Relic One catalog and subscribe to it from your account. Because custom visualizations are Nerdpack artifacts, you publish and subscribe to them the same way you publish and subscribe to New Relic One applications. Once you've done so, you can add your custom visualization to a dashboard: If you want to reuse your visualization to present different data or the same data in a new way, you can go back to Apps > Custom Visualizations, choose your visualization, configure another instance and add it to your dashboard: Resources Here is a list of resources for using custom visualizations: Add custom visualizations to your dashboards (Documentation) New Relic Dashboards and Custom Visualizations: Flexibility with Less Toil (Blog) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (Video)",

      "body": "One way for users to access your Nerdlet is by creating a launcher. The launcher opens a Nerdlet from the Apps page in New Relic. You can also provide access to your Nerdlet from an entity in your account. In this guide, you'll learn how to attach your Nerdlet to your entities. Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install and configure the New Relic One CLI Create a Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 Create a Nerdpack with the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name entity-nerdlet This results in a Nerdpack, called entity-nerdlet, which consists of a launcher, called entity-nerdlet-launcher, and a Nerdlet, called entity-nerdlet-nerdlet. Step 2 of 4 Serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ cd entity-nerdlet $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 4 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and navigate to Apps: ?nerdpacks=local is required to enable your locally served Nerdpacks to load in New Relic. Step 4 of 4 Under Your apps, click your launcher to view your New Relic One application: Attach your Nerdlet to entities You've seen how you can access your Nerdlet from a launcher. Now, access your Nerdlet from your entities. Step 1 of 6 From inside your Nerdpack's root directory, open nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json. This is your Nerdlet's metadata file. You'll use this file to attach your Nerdlet to entities. Step 2 of 6 Add a context object with an entities array: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [] 8 } 9 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy This tells New Relic that you want to surface your Nerdlet in an array of entity contexts. Step 3 of 6 Add an entity context: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [ 8 { 9 \"domain\": \"APM\", 10 \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" 11 } 12 ] 13 } 14 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Here, you've attached your Nerdlet to all application entities in the APM domain. Step 4 of 6 Go to APM: Because you're serving your Nerdpack locally, remember that you must still specify the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 5 of 6 Choose any of your applications: Step 6 of 6 Scroll down to see your Nerdlet attached to the application: Click this menu option and see your Nerdlet the same way you did with the launcher. Configure your entities context The context.entities key in your Nerdlet's nr1.json file specifies which entities your Nerdlet should be attached to. Specify an entity domain Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity domain by specifying the domain as one of the following values: APM: Application Performance Monitoring BROWSER: Browser INFRA: Infrastructure monitoring MOBILE: Mobile monitoring SYNTH: Synthetic monitoring For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities in the APM domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those in a domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"!APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities in multiple domains: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" }] } } Copy Specify an entity type Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity type by specifying the type as one of the following values: APPLICATION HOST MONITOR For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities of the APPLICATION type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those of a specified type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"!APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity whose type matches one of an array of types: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }, { \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }] } } Copy Specify entity tags Attach your Nerdlet to entities that have a given tag. For example, attach your Nerdlet to the entity which has a particular GUID: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"guid\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ENTITY GUID>\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity which has particular accountId and uses the Python programming language: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"accountId\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ACCOUNT ID>\"] }, { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Combine filters When you filter the entities to which your Nerdlet will be added, you can combine domain, type, and tags: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"domain\": \"APM\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\", \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] }, { \"domain\": \"SYNTH\", \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" } ] } } Copy In this example, you've attached your Nerdlet to: All APM applications whose metadata tags specify the python language AND all Synthetic monitors AND all Browser entities",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start.

When you build a New Relic One application, it's valuable to view it on the platform. This helps you design, implement, and debug your application in the environment it will eventually be published to. With nr1, you can launch a development server that hosts your application so that New Relic One can present it to you.

Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] }, \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add navigation to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you finished the A/B test application you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to prepare it for publication. When you publish your app to the New Relic One catalog, users can view it and subscribe to it. You can help your users by showing and telling them what the app does, how to use it, and more. Create catalog information To supply information to the catalog about your app, you need to create the catalog directory in your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 6 Change to the describe-app/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test Step 2 of 6 Create the catalog directory: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog This creates a catalog directory with template files for inputting custom information about your app. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog directory. Step 3 of 6 Update catalog/documentation.md: ## Documentation This application combines and presents data from New Relic and the Nerdsletter API so that we can make an informed decision on which design version results in more high-quality newsletter subscriptions. It also presents an button to end the test, which saves the date and version descriptions in local storage. We can use this app for future A/B tests as well! catalog/documentation.md Copy For this course, you're keeping the documentation concise by merely describing what the app does. In your own projects, you might also include instructions for contributing to the project in an open source context, installing the app's dependencies, or anything else that might help a user navigate complexities in your app or code. Step 4 of 6 Update catalog/config.json: { \"tagline\": \"Win @ newsletter subscriptions\", \"details\": \"Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course\", \"whatsNew\": \"Initial release! Includes:\\n- A variety of charts for understanding the test results\\n- An end test button for storing some test data in a table\", \"support\": { \"email\": { \"address\": \"\" }, \"issues\": { \"url\": \"\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"\" } } } catalog/config.json Copy Here, you've specified a tagline, project details, the source code repository, and a short list of everything included in the initial release. In other projects, you might also add a support email or support links. Step 5 of 6 Save the this screenshot to your catalog/screenshots directory. Users will be able to see a carousel of screenshots in your app's About page in the catalog. Step 6 of 6 Save the following icon as icon.png in two places: nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test/launchers/ab-test-launcher This will act as the launcher's icon and the app's catalog icon on the About page. Now you've added documentation, screenshots, metadata, and an icon to your app so that users will be able to understand what it does and why they might need it. For now, these files are all local and they need to be submitted to the catalog. But before you can do that, your app, itself, needs to be published to the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll publish your app, submit your catalog information, and view the results in New Relic.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Fetch data from a third-party service, before starting this one. In this course, you're building a New Relic One application. This application shows telemetry data from a demo service that is running an A/B test so that it can reveal that data in charts, like a dashboard. Your New Relic application is different than a dashboard, however, because it does more than show New Relic data. It pulls external data, provides UI components and functionality, and even has its own small data stores. The purpose of this New Relic application is to present context so you can better understand the A/B test results and how those results tie in to your business objectives. So far, you've built all your charts, organized them for improved usability, provided them with real data, and more. There are some final improvements you can make, using Platform API components. In this lesson, you learn how to use values in the New Relic platform state. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-platform-state-context/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, add a PlatformStateContext.Consumer to your NewsletterSignups component's render() method: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Notice that NrqlQuery uses a constant called ACCOUNT_ID. Instead of hardcoding an account identifier in your Nerdlet, you can use accountId from the platform URL state. Step 3 of 10 PlatformStateContext.Consumer provides access to the platform's URL state. This context contains an important value you'll use in your app, called timeRange. Notice that your NrqlQuery uses a SINCE clause that identifies the historical timeframe your query should fetch data from. Right now, that SINCE clause is set to 30 MINUTES AGO. With timeRange, you can use the platform's time picker to make this timeframe adjustable. Step 4 of 10 Utilize the platform state's timeRange: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, NewsletterSignups uses platformState.timeRange instead of a hardcoded SINCE clause. While NrqlQuery components accept a convenient timeRange prop, not every component does. You can still use timeRange in other contexts by accessing duration, begin_time, or end_time: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { console.log(platformState.timeRange.duration); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>; Copy Step 5 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test. Step 6 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 7 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 10 View your application: Your NrqlQuery now uses the platform state's timeRange, but your chart probably still shows the last 30 minutes. Why? Where does the timeRange in platform state come from? The time picker sits on the right side of your application's navigation bar: Change this value and see your chart update: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 9 of 10 Update VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Of all the charts in your New Relic One application, these three charts are the ones that should update with the time picker. The others, Total subscriptions per version, Total cancellations per version, Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions, Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, show total values over time. So, hardcoding their SINCE clauses to 7 DAYS AGO makes sense, as this is a reasonable time period for the purposes of this course. Step 10 of 10 While still serving your Nerdpack locally, view your NR1 app to see your charts updating with the time range you choose: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now that you're basing your queries off the platform state, some of your charts are dynamic in their time ranges. This is a great improvement because it allows you to adjust your charts to show data from any particular point in time, which is useful for tying data to business outcomes. The Platform API components offer a lot more functionality, too, including the ability to navigate the user to another place in New Relic. You'll learn how to do this in the next lesson.

      "body": "One way for users to access your Nerdlet is by creating a launcher. The launcher opens a Nerdlet from the Apps page in New Relic. You can also provide access to your Nerdlet from an entity in your account. In this guide, you'll learn how to attach your Nerdlet to your entities. Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install and configure the New Relic One CLI Create a Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 Create a Nerdpack with the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name entity-nerdlet This results in a Nerdpack, called entity-nerdlet, which consists of a launcher, called entity-nerdlet-launcher, and a Nerdlet, called entity-nerdlet-nerdlet. Step 2 of 4 Serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ cd entity-nerdlet $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 4 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and navigate to Apps: ?nerdpacks=local is required to enable your locally served Nerdpacks to load in New Relic. Step 4 of 4 Under Your apps, click your launcher to view your New Relic One application: Attach your Nerdlet to entities You've seen how you can access your Nerdlet from a launcher. Now, access your Nerdlet from your entities. Step 1 of 6 From inside your Nerdpack's root directory, open nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json. This is your Nerdlet's metadata file. You'll use this file to attach your Nerdlet to entities. Step 2 of 6 Add a context object with an entities array: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [] 8 } 9 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy This tells New Relic that you want to surface your Nerdlet in an array of entity contexts. Step 3 of 6 Add an entity context: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [ 8 { 9 \"domain\": \"APM\", 10 \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" 11 } 12 ] 13 } 14 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Here, you've attached your Nerdlet to all application entities in the APM domain. Step 4 of 6 Go to APM: Because you're serving your Nerdpack locally, remember that you must still specify the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 5 of 6 Choose any of your applications: Step 6 of 6 Scroll down to see your Nerdlet attached to the application: Click this menu option and see your Nerdlet the same way you did with the launcher. Configure your entities context The context.entities key in your Nerdlet's nr1.json file specifies which entities your Nerdlet should be attached to. Specify an entity domain Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity domain by specifying the domain as one of the following values: APM: Application Performance Monitoring BROWSER: Browser INFRA: Infrastructure monitoring MOBILE: Mobile monitoring SYNTH: Synthetic monitoring For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities in the APM domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those in a domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"!APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities in multiple domains: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" }] } } Copy Specify an entity type Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity type by specifying the type as one of the following values: APPLICATION HOST MONITOR For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities of the APPLICATION type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those of a specified type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"!APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity whose type matches one of an array of types: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }, { \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }] } } Copy Specify entity tags Attach your Nerdlet to entities that have a given tag. For example, attach your Nerdlet to the entity which has a particular GUID: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"guid\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ENTITY GUID>\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity which has particular accountId and uses the Python programming language: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"accountId\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ACCOUNT ID>\"] }, { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Combine filters When you filter the entities to which your Nerdlet will be added, you can combine domain, type, and tags: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"domain\": \"APM\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\", \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] }, { \"domain\": \"SYNTH\", \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" } ] } } Copy In this example, you've attached your Nerdlet to: All APM applications whose metadata tags specify the python language AND all Synthetic monitors AND all Browser entities",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add chart components to your A/B test application, before starting this one. In this course, you’re building an A/B test application for the New Relic platform. Previously, you learned about the New Relic One SDK and its component library. Now, It’s time for you to start building your application focusing first on chart components. Before you write any code, consult your design guide to remember what the application will look like when you finish: There are several charts you need to create, which may seem overwhelming at first, but take it one step at a time. The topmost chart, and the first you’ll create, is a line chart that shows the number of users who sign up for your newsletter and what version of your website they were shown. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-your-first-chart/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-your-first-chart/ab-test This directory contains the code your application should have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named newsletter-signups.js: bash Copy $ touch newsletter-signups.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a component called NewsletterSignups to hold your first LineChart and some mock data: import React from 'react'; import { LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } const versionBSignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-b-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 20 }, { x: 10, y: 5 }, { x: 20, y: 25 }, { x: 30, y: 45 }, { x: 40, y: 50 }, { x: 50, y: 35 }, ], } return <LineChart data={[versionASignups, versionBSignups]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Here, you’ve created two arbitrary data series which represent versions A and B of your test. Right now, you're using manually-crafted data points. In the future, you'll replace these with data queried from New Relic. Notice that you’ve specified a color for each series in the chart. The color metadata attribute takes any CSS-acceptable color format. Setting viz: 'main' means that you want to render the LineChart series as a line, the component's default display style. For the data prop in the LineChart component, you passed the two series in an array so that both are represented together. Finally, you used the chart’s fullWidth prop to stretch the chart’s width to fill the view. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and replace the default heading in your Nerdlet's render() method with your new component: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-your-first-chart/ab-test. Step 6 of 8 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 7 of 8 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the LineChart displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. In seven steps, you’ve breathed life into your New Relic One application. Instead of a bland “Hello world” message, your application now shows a colorful line chart with two mocked data series. These data series represent server-side traffic for each of the competing designs in your demo website. In the next lesson, you’ll build on this foundation by creating another chart type.

So far, it consists of a single line chart, which represents the number of subscriptions your newsletter receives from each version of your website. To understand what you’ll build in this lesson, review the design guide to remember what charts come next: In the design, there are two pie charts beneath the line chart that you’ve already created. One represents the distribution of users who receive version A and version B. The other represents the distribution of successful requests from users who got version A and version B. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-pie-charts/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next.

Because PieChart uses unidimensional data, its series only take y-values. Step 4 of 9 In total-cancellations.js, create a component, called TotalCancellations, which renders mocked cancellation data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new components and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test.

In this lesson, you’ll create a new pair of line charts and learn how to synchronize their behaviors.

These line graphs show the version-specific response times for newsletter signup requests. Now, you’ll build two more line charts, but this time, you’ll group them with a ChartGroup and specify that their values are measured in milliseconds. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-a-chart-group/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named page-views.js: bash Copy $ touch page-views.js Step 3 of 9 In this new file, create a component called VersionPageViews to hold a LineChart, which shows the number of times a page is viewed: import React from 'react'; import { LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Notice the new attribute in the series' metadata fields: units_data. This attribute describes the unit type for a specified data axis. In this case, you set the unit type for the y axis to 'MS', which stands for milliseconds. Other options for unit types, include: 'PERCENTAGE', 'TIMESTAMP', and 'BYTES_PER_SECOND'. Step 4 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In index.js, import ChartGroup from nr1 and group your VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <ChartGroup> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </ChartGroup> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Because the tables are conceptually related, as they show contrasting performance metrics over the same timeslice, it makes sense to group them in a ChartGroup. This means that the two charts behave synchronously. For example, when you hover over one chart, the other chart shows a hover indicator at the same x coordinate. Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the LineChart components synchronized in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Tip Each of the chart component types you've used in this lesson have had different series configurations. Most chart components share the same metadata attributes, like LineChart and PieChart, but differ in their data formats. It's helpful to be aware of the different data formats, for when you create your own charts. You can read more about the data formats in the chart component documentation. Now your application is filled with charts, but it doesn't look great. The charts are stacked on top of one another in an unhelpful way. In the next lesson, you'll learn about the user interface components from the SDK and how you can use them to organize your charts. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. When you're ready, continue on to the next lesson: Add user interface components to your application.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add your first chart, before starting this one. You’ve begun building your A/B test application. So far, it consists of a single line chart, which represents the number of subscriptions your newsletter receives from each version of your website. To understand what you’ll build in this lesson, review the design guide to remember what charts come next: In the design, there are two pie charts beneath the line chart that you’ve already created. One represents the distribution of users who receive version A and version B. The other represents the distribution of successful requests from users who got version A and version B. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-pie-charts/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add two new Javascript files: total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js bash Copy $ touch total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js Step 3 of 9 In total-subscriptions.js, create a component, called TotalSubscriptions, which renders mocked subscription data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Notice that the series data is formatted differently for PieChart than it was for LineChart. Because PieChart uses unidimensional data, its series only take y-values. Step 4 of 9 In total-cancellations.js, create a component, called TotalCancellations, which renders mocked cancellation data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new components and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test.

When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Your application is starting to take shape. You’ve created a line chart and two pie charts. For now, these charts use mocked data, but you’ll provide them real data in a later lesson. Before you focus on the data in your charts, however, you’ll learn how to add a table to your application so you can visualize data in a new way.

These charts, offered out-of-the-box, are customizable in that you can: Resize and arrange their positions in your dashboard Update their names, display options, and underlying data queries But sometimes the charts we include in the platform aren't enough for you to get the most from your data. When you want to visualize your data in a specific way that isn't possible with our charts, you can build a custom visualization. New Relic is programmable. This means that if the platform doesn't solve your specific problem, you can write and deploy your own code to fill in some of those gaps. One area where programmability is valuable is in visualizing your data. While New Relic offers all the telemetry data that your apps and services report and provides many different kinds of charts to present that data, you might need to create something entirely unique. With the New Relic One SDK, we've provided you all the tools you'll need to create your own visualizations. Build your custom visualization With the New Relic One SDK, you can create a Nerdpack, which houses your visualization code. This code consists of a React component, logic, data queries, and external dependencies. The SDK also provides a component library that you can use to make NerdGraph requests, access platform state context, and more. Your first visualization To build your first custom visualization, install the New Relic One SDK and make sure you have the latest version: bash Copy $ nr1 update Create a Nerdpack and a visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name custom-viz ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you.

Serve your visualization locally: bash Copy $ cd my-first-viz $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ custom-viz https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Important To view the locally served visualization, you must use the nerdpacks=local querystring. Enter values into the fields under Configure visualization properties and see how the chart changes: Resources Here is a list of resources for building custom visualizations: Build a custom visualization for dashboards (Guide) Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK (Guide) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Customize your visualization You have a lot of control over how your visualization operates. You can choose what properties of the visualization are customizable, such as colors, sizes, and how you present your legend. You can choose whether it presents New Relic data or data from an external source. You can even install and use third-party components to create a specific look: Resources Here is a list of resources for configuring custom visualizations: Configuration options (Documentation) Customize visualizations with configuration (Guide) Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (Video) Use your custom visualization During development, you can serve your visualization locally. Under Apps > Custom Visualizations, you can view and configure your visualization to see how your data looks, but you can't instantiate that chart and use it in your account: To do that, you need to publish it to the New Relic One catalog and subscribe to it from your account. Because custom visualizations are Nerdpack artifacts, you publish and subscribe to them the same way you publish and subscribe to New Relic One applications. Once you've done so, you can add your custom visualization to a dashboard: If you want to reuse your visualization to present different data or the same data in a new way, you can go back to Apps > Custom Visualizations, choose your visualization, configure another instance and add it to your dashboard: Resources Here is a list of resources for using custom visualizations: Add custom visualizations to your dashboards (Documentation) New Relic Dashboards and Custom Visualizations: Flexibility with Less Toil (Blog) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (Video)",

Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Tip To use the data explorer and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces apps to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From data explorer you can access query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

Change the appearance of your chart When you run your query in advanced (NRQL) mode or view your chart while using basic mode to specify data, the query builder analyzes your data and applies a chart type that fits your data. For some queries, you'll have several options of chart types to choose from. To change chart type, use the Chart type menu to the right of the current chart. Each type in the list has a tooltip with information about using that type. Example of the chart type menu, showing a tooltip. Customize your charts While we try our best to optimize how we display your data, sometimes you may have other needs. To this end, you can customize charts to display information at your convenience. Tip Customizations are available depending on the chart type. Format date and time Tip For table and billboard charts. Customize the date and time format for tables and billboards: for each type of data, you can select if you want to leave it as it is, or modify the format as Numeric or Date.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add tables, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you added a variety of charts to your A/B test application. These charts presented different facets of information about your A/B test, and they behaved independently from one other. In this lesson, you’ll create a new pair of line charts and learn how to synchronize their behaviors. Before you write any new code, consult your design guide to understand the role that these new charts will play in your application: In the design guide, there is a line graph under each of the tables you created in the last lesson. These line graphs show the version-specific response times for newsletter signup requests. Now, you’ll build two more line charts, but this time, you’ll group them with a ChartGroup and specify that their values are measured in milliseconds. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-a-chart-group/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named page-views.js: bash Copy $ touch page-views.js Step 3 of 9 In this new file, create a component called VersionPageViews to hold a LineChart, which shows the number of times a page is viewed: import React from 'react'; import { LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Notice the new attribute in the series' metadata fields: units_data. This attribute describes the unit type for a specified data axis. In this case, you set the unit type for the y axis to 'MS', which stands for milliseconds. Other options for unit types, include: 'PERCENTAGE', 'TIMESTAMP', and 'BYTES_PER_SECOND'. Step 4 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In index.js, import ChartGroup from nr1 and group your VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <ChartGroup> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </ChartGroup> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Because the tables are conceptually related, as they show contrasting performance metrics over the same timeslice, it makes sense to group them in a ChartGroup. This means that the two charts behave synchronously. For example, when you hover over one chart, the other chart shows a hover indicator at the same x coordinate. Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the LineChart components synchronized in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Tip Each of the chart component types you've used in this lesson have had different series configurations. Most chart components share the same metadata attributes, like LineChart and PieChart, but differ in their data formats. It's helpful to be aware of the different data formats, for when you create your own charts. You can read more about the data formats in the chart component documentation. Now your application is filled with charts, but it doesn't look great. The charts are stacked on top of one another in an unhelpful way. In the next lesson, you'll learn about the user interface components from the SDK and how you can use them to organize your charts.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add user interface components to your application, before starting this one. In previous hands-on lessons, you created all the charts from your design guide. Unfortunately, they aren’t laid out like they are in the design. The New Relic One SDK provides multiple solutions for organizing your components. The one you’ll learn about in this lesson is the Grid component. To arrange your charts, place them in a Grid. A Grid is a container you use to organize your content into 12-column rows. A GridItem is the building block for a Grid. You specify the columnSpan of a GridItem between 1 and 12 to determine how much of the row that the GridItem should cover. So, if you want a chart to stretch across the width of the view, you would place the chart in a GridItem with a columnSpan of 12. If you want twelve charts to fit in a single row, use a columnSpan of 1. Using the design guide as a base, you can plan how to organize your Grid: Once you’ve planned out how you’re going to arrange your columns, you can write some code to realize your plans. Step 1 of 6 Change to the add-a-grid/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import Grid and GridItem. Then, update your Nerdlet's render() method by placing each chart in a GrildItem. Finally, place all your items in a Grid: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy The columnSpan for each chart matches the layout plan. Every chart that takes up half the 12-column row has a columnSpan of 6, and every chart that takes up the whole row has a columnSpan of 12. Notice that each of the charts in the ChartGroup, but not the ChartGroup itself, is in a GridItem. A ChartGroup connects charts' behaviors, not their locations. Each chart fills its columnSpan because they use the fullWidth prop. fullWidth makes the chart fill its available horizontal space and GridItem.columnSpan restricts that space to some fraction of the row. Remove a fullWidth prop, and see how the chart reacts. Technical detail Notice the wrapper class applied to the Grid. We quietly provided some CSS styles to help make this app look great! This isn't a CSS course, so we won't cover everything we added, we'll just include the styles we intend for you to use in the code snippets. Just know that every UI component in the New Relic One SDK provides a className prop where you can provide a CSS class name. You can view the styles in nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see your charts styled and arranged in a grid. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. In just six steps, you significantly improved the readability and usability of your A/B test application, but you can take further steps to improve the usability of your charts. In the next lesson, you’ll add headings to your charts to remind yourself of what data each chart presents.

      "body": "Here are some limits, requirements, and recommendations when you create metrics from events, logs, or spans. Metric aggregation Your NRQL query must use one of the following summary, uniqueCount, or distribution functions to aggregate metrics: Function Comments summary Creates a summary metric data point for each time window (currently 1 minute). Use this if your NRQL query uses aggregator functions supported by the summary metric type, such as average, sum, min, or max. Example rule-creation query: SELECT summary(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host Copy uniqueCount Creates a uniqueCount metric data point for each 1-minute time window. Use this if your NRQL query uses the uniqueCount aggregator type. Example rule-creation query: FROM Transaction SELECT uniqueCount(request.headers.userAgent) AS 'server.request.header.userAgent.uniqueCount' WHERE appName = 'Browser Monitoring Router' FACET httpResponseCode, name, appName, host Copy distribution Creates a distribution metric data point for each 1-minute time window. Use this if your NRQL query uses aggregator functions such as percentile, histogram, min, max, average, sum, or count. Use only the attribute of interest as the argument, and discard the rest of the arguments from percentile or histogram. The generated metric supports any argument on percentile or histogram. Example of creating a distribution rule: SELECT distribution(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host Copy Simple count: summary(1) and sum If you want a metric that's a simple count of the events, logs, or spans that match a particular WHERE clause, use the summary(1) metric. This metric type counts the number of specified events, logs, or spans per minute. When querying the created metric, use the sum method to see the result. Example: If you want to create a metric named foo.count that counts the transactions named foo, the NRQL would look like this: FROM Transaction SELECT summary(1) AS 'foo.count' WHERE name = 'foo' Copy Then, you would query it like this: FROM Metric SELECT sum(foo.count) SINCE 30 minutes ago Copy For more information about metrics, see our documentation about metric types. Rule-creation limits These limits affect metric rules creation: Limits Comments Account limits An account can have a maximum of 1,000 metric-creation rules. Metric rule limits A rule can: Create a maximum of 10 metrics. Use only one type of data (events, logs, or spans). Select a maximum of 20 attributes (facets) to include on a metric. Time window limits 50K limit on unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations for a single metric in a 24-hour time window. If this limit is exceeded, the rule is disabled and an NrIntegrationError event is created in the account that includes: The rule details A message about having too many facets A newRelicFeature of eventToMetric Limits on metric name and attribute value combinations The limit on total unique metric name/attribute value combinations in a 24-hour time window for an account is: Equal to three times the purchased monthly average data points per minute Up to a maximum of 10M Cardinality limits Rule-creation limits include limits on the number of unique combinations of metric name and attribute values. This limit exists because a large number of attributes and/or attribute values can lead to an exponential increase in the size of data reported. Example metric creation rule that attaches five attributes: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName, entityName, processId Copy If each of the five attributes reported ten unique values within a one-minute time window, the number of unique metric-name/attribute combinations would theoretically have a maximum of 10x10x10x10x10, or 100,000. Multiple attributes with multiple unique values can lead to a large number of unique metric entries. In practice, this isn't usually the case, because attributes are often related. For example, if one attribute is hostname and another is awsRegion, when you see hostname A, it will always be in AWS region B; you'd never see hostname A and other AWS region values. This is why it's important, during the NRQL creation process, to use the uniqueCount function to verify how many unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations your NRQL query is generating. Multiple metrics from one rule A rule can create up to ten metrics. There are no functional differences between metrics created one at a time and those created with a single rule. Reasons for creating multiple metrics with a single rule: Less likely to reach rules-per-account limit. Easier to add the same attributes to multiple metrics. Example creating multiple metrics with a single rule: FROM Transaction SELECT uniqueCount(request.headers.userAgent) AS 'server.request.header.userAgent.uniqueCount', summary(duration) AS 'server.duration', summary(totalTime) AS 'server.totalTime' WHERE appName = 'Browser Monitoring Router' FACET httpResponseCode, name, appName, host Copy Metric naming A metric is given a name with the AS clause, as part of the NRQL rule-creation process. In the following NRQL example, the name of the metric is io.totalread.bytes: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy If there is no name assigned with the AS clause, the metric name is the name of the queried attribute. In this example, if no name was assigned, the metric name would be ioTotalReadBytes. Metric names Requirements and recommendations Requirements Requirements for naming a metric: Less than or equal to 255 (UTF-16) 16-bit code units. One way to ensure you are under the limit is to keep each string under 127 of whatever is easiest to count. No spaces. Start with a letter. Examples of strong metric names: rubyvm.memory.heap_used redis.container.cpu.percent memcached.process_virtual_memory.bytes Length and structure Decide on a name and structure that makes it easy for others to find, understand, and use this metric. We recommend keeping your metric name under 40 characters for ideal readability. Longer names can get cut off or overlap with other names. Your metric naming scheme will depend on your business logic. You may want to use namespaces to prefix your metric name, or your names may need to be more general. Components within the name If you want to create components within your metric name (like the source of metrics and the thing you’re measuring), we recommend going from broad to specific (left to right): Use a dot to separate those components in order to be consistent with our New Relic metric names. Then, use an underscore to separate words within the dots. Example: application.page_view.duration Copy Attributes Avoid putting attributes in your metric name. Attributes are qualities of your metric that you can use to filter or facet your data, like cluster or availability zone. Example: If you included availability zone in your metric name, it would mean, for that metric, you wouldn’t be able to see results across all availability zones. Changing metric names If you change a metric name, historical data will not be updated to that new name. To query or chart that historical data, you will need to specify the older metric name.",

For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation function You can use NRQL query function, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, with the Browser agent, with the Mobile agent, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure Monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, Infrastructure Monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights At New Relic, Insights used to be the primary way to query and chart your New Relic-reported data. Now, we have the improved query builder. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our Mobile Monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account A master account is a New Relic account that has one or more subordinate accounts (sub-accounts). For details, see Account structure. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, Mobile Monitoring, and Browser Monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile Monitoring Mobile Monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile Monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our Full Stack Observability pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add NrqlQuery components to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In this series, you're creating a New Relic One application, or NR1 app for short, that shows A/B test data in a variety of charts. Most of the charts need to show data that comes from a demo service you spun up at the beginning of this series. To refresh your memory on what you're building, review your design guide: In the last lesson, you supplied real data, which comes from New Relic's database, to the following charts: Newsletter subscriptions per version Version A - Page views Version B - Page views Total subscriptions per version Because you have experience querying subscription and page view data, you may feel ready to supply data to even more charts: Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions However, these charts are different than the charts you've supplied data to because they compare data from two different sources: subscription events and pageView events. In this lesson, you learn how to format data from multiple sources to exist in the same chart. Experiment with data in the Data explorer Step 1 of 6 From your New Relic homepage's top navigation menu, go to to the Data explorer: Here, you can experiment with subscription event and pageView event queries to make sure you fetch the right data in your app. Step 2 of 6 Select subscription from the Custom events menu: This queries NRDB for subscription event totals per minute over the last 30 minutes and shows that data in a chart: Step 3 of 6 Click Dimensions to see a list of the attributes associated with these subscription events: You can filter and group subscription events using these dimensions. For Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, you want to filter your subscription totals by page_version. Step 4 of 6 Click the NRQL query to navigate to the Query builder: Here, you can view and manually edit the query to fetch the data you need. Step 5 of 6 Add a WHERE clause to filter subscription totals by page_version: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Remove the TIMESERIES clause to fetch a count: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO Copy Modify the SINCE clause to see totals over the past week: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO Copy Click Run and see the data visualized in a billboard chart instead of a line chart: Step 6 of 6 Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions need a combined total of four data values: All-time subscription totals for version A All-time page view totals for version A All-time subscription totals for version B All-time page view totals for version B Experiment with the Query builder to discover the four queries which pull the right data. In the end, you'll come up with the following four queries: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'b' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = 'b' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO Copy technical detail Unlike other structured query languages, NRQL doesn't provide a mechanism for joining data across sources. This is why you have to perform two queries to get subscription event totals and pageView event totals. Until now, you've provided every chart with a single query. Here, you have to provide two queries per chart. In the remaining steps, you'll learn how to customize NrqlQuery results to merge data from multiple sources. Merge NRQL from multiple sources Step 1 of 9 Change to the customize-nrql-data/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/customize-nrql-data/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 9 In your Nerdlet's totals.js file, implement constructor() and the React lifecycle method componentDidMount() in VersionTotals: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { tableData: { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } } } componentDidMount() { NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[0].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[1].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[this.state.tableData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Here, you initialize your state in the component's constructor. The state has a single value, tableData, which holds series data and metadata for the TableChart. In componentDidMount(), you query the data that populates the data in this state. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that is called when a component is mounted in the component tree. You use this method, instead of the constructor, to query data because your logic, which requests data from New Relic, introduces side effects and sets state values, neither of which you should do in the constructor. In componentDidMount(), you use NrqlQuery in a new way. First, you specified the formatType to NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW because you're going to modify the data instead of supplying it directly to a chart Before, you used its JSX form in the render() method of a chart. Second, you called its query() method and handled the results in a then() callback, which logs them to the console. Step 3 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, create a constant called ACCOUNT_ID and pass it to VersionTotals: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/ Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 4 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/customize-nrql-data/ab-test. Step 5 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 6 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Navigate to your app in New Relic. Step 7 of 9 To view your logs, which are useful for uncovering errors in your application, turn on developer tools in your favorite browser and navigate to the Console: FireFox instructions Safari instructions Chrome instructions With your app on-screen, notice the NRQL data in the console: This console log tells you that you can find the data you're looking for, namely the subscription or pageView count, at data.raw.results[0].count. The next step is to store that count in state.tableData. Tip If something doesn't work, use these debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 8 of 9 In totals.js, store the query data in state: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { tableData: { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } } } componentDidMount() { NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[0].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[1].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[this.state.tableData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Pay close attention to the data you're accessing. The array indices are particularly important to get right. The subscription data should go to state.tableData.data[0].count because in tableData, it is the first element in the data array: data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], Copy By similar logic, page view data should go to state.tableData.data[1].count. Step 9 of 9 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID In this lesson, you learned how to use NrqlQuery.query() to fetch data from multiple sources and stitch them together into data your chart can use. Notice that there are still two charts in your NR1 application that use mock data: Total unsubscriptions per version Past tests Unfortunately, your demo application doesn't create custom New Relic events when a user unsubscribes from your newsletter or you end an A/B test. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to populate Past tests.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Persist the selected version, before starting this one. In this tutorial, you're building an A/B test application. The application surfaces data about an ongoing A/B test on your website, which you then use to decide which page design version is most effective at engaging users. As part of that overarching goal, you're building a section which allows you to end the test by deciding a winner of the experiment: Unfortunately, there are a few issues with the code and design for this section. By the end of this course, pressing End test will tell your website's backend server that every customer should see the version selected here. This is destructive behavior because it makes an irreversible change to your website. To account for the desctructiveness of pressing End test, you need to modify some features of your application: Make the button look important to catch your eye Prompt yourself with a confirmation message before ending the test to ensure you don't end it prematurely Show and hide your confirmation modal Step 1 of 12 Change to the present-confirmation-modal/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test This directory contains the code your application should have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 12 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, update the Button to use the DESTRUCTIVE styling: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Tip Read more about Button and its props on the New Relic developer site. Step 3 of 12 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test. Step 4 of 12 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 12 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 12 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: Now you've styled your button to convey its destructive consequences, but that's not enough to prevent you from accidentally clicking it. Next, you create a shield for your website's backend. This extra layer of protection requires you to confirm that you intend to end the test before actually doing so. Step 7 of 12 Add a Modal to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Your new modal contains a heading, a confirmation message, the winning design version, and two buttons. You'll explore some of these components later in this course. With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your new Modal: Tip Remember, while your server is running, it will update automatically when you save your code. The modal looks great, but it has three issues: It was present before you clicked End test You can't dismiss it It always says you selected \"Version A\", even if you didn't In the following steps, you'll correct all three of these issues. Step 8 of 12 In EndTestButton, initialize state with a value for modalHidden: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy modalHidden determines whether or not to hide the modal. The default value of modalHidden is true because you only want to show the modal when you select End test. Step 9 of 12 Supply modalHidden to the Modal: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy First, you've created a constructor to accept component props. This provides your component access to the modalHidden prop that you passed in EndTestSection. Then you provide the value of modalHidden to the Modal component's hidden prop. Tip Read more about Modal and its props on the New Relic developer site. Step 10 of 12 Add and bind two new methods to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Use closeModal and showModal to close and show your modal, respectively, depending on how a user interacts with the modal. Step 11 of 12 Show the modal when you click End test: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you've supplied showModal() as the callback for the Button component's onClick event. Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. The modal is hidden by default. Click End test to see the modal. Step 12 of 12 Close the modal from the Modal component's onClose callback and from the Yes, end test and No, continue test buttons: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Click End test. The modal opens and displays your confirmation message. Close the modal by clicking X at the top right, either of its buttons, or even in the dark space to its left. Notice that the modal says you chose \"Version A\", even if you choose \"Version B\". This is because \"Version A\" is hardcoded in the Modal text. Next, you'll make that dynamic. Use the version you selected in your modal Step 1 of 2 In EndTestSection, pass selectedVersion to the EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Now, you can access the selected version from the EndTestButton component's props. Step 2 of 2 Use selectedVersion in your confirmation message: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Select \"Version B\" from the menu.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Fetch data from a third-party service, before starting this one. In this course, you're building a New Relic One application. This application shows telemetry data from a demo service that is running an A/B test so that it can reveal that data in charts, like a dashboard. Your New Relic application is different than a dashboard, however, because it does more than show New Relic data. It pulls external data, provides UI components and functionality, and even has its own small data stores. The purpose of this New Relic application is to present context so you can better understand the A/B test results and how those results tie in to your business objectives. So far, you've built all your charts, organized them for improved usability, provided them with real data, and more. There are some final improvements you can make, using Platform API components. In this lesson, you learn how to use values in the New Relic platform state. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-platform-state-context/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, add a PlatformStateContext.Consumer to your NewsletterSignups component's render() method: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Notice that NrqlQuery uses a constant called ACCOUNT_ID. Instead of hardcoding an account identifier in your Nerdlet, you can use accountId from the platform URL state. Step 3 of 10 PlatformStateContext.Consumer provides access to the platform's URL state. This context contains an important value you'll use in your app, called timeRange. Notice that your NrqlQuery uses a SINCE clause that identifies the historical timeframe your query should fetch data from. Right now, that SINCE clause is set to 30 MINUTES AGO. With timeRange, you can use the platform's time picker to make this timeframe adjustable. Step 4 of 10 Utilize the platform state's timeRange: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, NewsletterSignups uses platformState.timeRange instead of a hardcoded SINCE clause. While NrqlQuery components accept a convenient timeRange prop, not every component does. You can still use timeRange in other contexts by accessing duration, begin_time, or end_time: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { console.log(platformState.timeRange.duration); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>; Copy Step 5 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test. Step 6 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 7 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 10 View your application: Your NrqlQuery now uses the platform state's timeRange, but your chart probably still shows the last 30 minutes. Why? Where does the timeRange in platform state come from? The time picker sits on the right side of your application's navigation bar: Change this value and see your chart update: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 9 of 10 Update VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Of all the charts in your New Relic One application, these three charts are the ones that should update with the time picker. The others, Total subscriptions per version, Total cancellations per version, Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions, Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, show total values over time. So, hardcoding their SINCE clauses to 7 DAYS AGO makes sense, as this is a reasonable time period for the purposes of this course. Step 10 of 10 While still serving your Nerdpack locally, view your NR1 app to see your charts updating with the time range you choose: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now that you're basing your queries off the platform state, some of your charts are dynamic in their time ranges. This is a great improvement because it allows you to adjust your charts to show data from any particular point in time, which is useful for tying data to business outcomes. The Platform API components offer a lot more functionality, too, including the ability to navigate the user to another place in New Relic. You'll learn how to do this in the next lesson.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you used PlatformStateContext from the New Relic One SDK to look up the time range that the user selected from the app's time picker. Now, you'll learn about another component that interacts with the New Relic platform: navigation. The navigation component lets you open entities, navigate to entities, and build Location objects for entities from your Nerdlet. You can also use navigation for other Nerdlets and launchers. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-navigation/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In newsletter-signups.js, create a new method, called NewsletterSignups.openApmEntity(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. This method uses navigation.openStackedEntity() to display your demo application's APM entity in a stacked view. Notice openApmEntity() requires your ENTITY_GUID. You need to locate that ID and store it in a constant. Step 3 of 10 Navigate to APM: See metadata for your Newsletter service: Copy the entity's GUID: Create an ENTITY_GUID constant: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and the entity GUID you just copied, respectively. Now, openApmEntity() knows what entity to show. Next, you need to create a button to invoke this method. Step 4 of 10 Create a button to show your APM entity: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you've created a button and configured it to call openApmEntity() when it's clicked. Step 5 of 10 Import Stack and StackItem: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. You'll use Stack and StackItem to lay out the button on the far right side of the same row that the HeadingText is on. Step 6 of 10 Lay out the Stack: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <Stack fullWidth> <StackItem grow={true}> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> </StackItem> <StackItem> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> </StackItem> </Stack> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you used a full-width Stack to set up the layout for the row. To make the HeadingText fill the entire row except the width of the button, you used the StackItem.grow prop. Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. Click App performance: Now you see the stacked entity: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively Congratulations! You're finished writing all the code you'll write for your New Relic One A/B test application. Now, you have an application reporting New Relic data from your demo service that is running an A/B test. You've created several charts, buttons, and other UI elements. And you've organized your components into a readable and usable view. On top of the visuals, you've supplied data to your charts from multiple data sources in and outside of New Relic. You've created some backend functionality which utilizes your New Relic One application's own data store. You've also utilized the platform APIs for interacting with platform UI and showing a stacked entity view. You've really accomplished a lot throughout this course, so far. There are only a few things left to do! First, is to learn how to publish and subscribe to your New Relic One application so that it can run on our platform instead of your own local server. Second, is to learn how to deal with some common issues you might see in New Relic One application development.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Before you begin Explore our custom visualization guides and build your first visualization. After you're done, you'll have a better foundation for building more complex visualizations, such as the one you'll build in this course. Finally, if you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create your visualization Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called radar-or-treemap, in a Nerdpack, called alternate-viz: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name radar-or-treemap ✔ You’re trying to create a visualization outside of a Nerdpack. We’ll create a Nerdpack for you—what do you want to name it? … alternate-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack alternate-viz is available at \"./alternate-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization radar-or-treemap is available at \"./alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/radar-or-treemap directory under alternate-viz: bash Copy $ cd alternate-viz $ ls visualizations/radar-or-treemap index.js nr1.json styles.scss Set up your component state Add component state to the default visualization template that nr1 created for you.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type.

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Before you begin Explore our custom visualization guides and build your first visualization.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add a new configuration option Step 1 of 8 In your visualization's nr1.json file, add an enum configuration object for selectedChart: index.js nr1.json 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 'Radar': 'radar', 24 'Treemap': 'treemap' 25 } 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

      "info": "Build a \"Hello, World!\" app and publish it to New Relic One",
      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have accounts in GitHub and New Relic. To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in the New Relic One Catalog, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

Check your permissions To subscribe to a Nerdpack, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can subscribe to them: Publish your Nerdpack Tag your Nerdpack if it's published and doesn't yet have a tag Subscribe to a Nerdpack Subscribe to a published Nerdpack, with either the web UI or the nr1 CLI, to use it in your account. Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack under New Relic One catalog: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the New Relic One catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack.

Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel. Tip nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:unset. Read the nr1 subscription:unset documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:unset --help Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you subscribe to a Nerdpack, you may run into issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called my-awesome-visualization, in a Nerdpack, called my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name my-awesome-visualization ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ... my-awesome-nerdpack ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-awesome-nerdpack is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization my-awesome-visualization is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

Use this to distinguish between published Nerdpacks and locally served Nerdpacks. Step 5 of 5 When you're ready to stop serving your Nerdpack locally, type CTRL+C into your terminal where the server is running. Resolve issues with accessing your local Nerdpack Sometimes, when you serve your Nerdpack locally, you may come across issues. You may be unable to serve your Nerdpack because of bugs in your code. Or, you may successfully serve your Nerdpack but be unable to find it in New Relic. Consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your application When you attempt to serve your Nerdpack locally, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve --verbose Show locally served Nerdpacks If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, make sure you're using the ?nerdpacks=local query string. If you're not, New Relic won't load your locally served Nerdpack on the platform. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you serve your Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:serve, you must be signed into the same profile in New Relic that you're serving with locally. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic and you're using the correct query string, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same. Access your proxy browser Generally, you don't need to know how your application code is loaded in New Relic. But understanding how it works can help you resolve issues with your local server. When you run nr1 nerdpack:serve, your code is served by your local machine using an nr-local.net subdomain. This domain points to 127.0.0.1, and uses a variety of ports to connect, including 9973. To load a Nerdpack into the platform, whether it's locally served or published to the app catalog, New Relic uses an <IFRAME> and a separate domain (a subdomain of nr-ext.net), relying on same-domain policy to sandbox the code. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, you're using the correct query string, and you're using the correct profile, your network administrator may need to enable access to: Any subdomain of nr-local.net, or, at the very least, to any domain of the shape of <UserId>.nr-local.net, where <UserId> is a 32-hexadecimal character identifier that is unique to the user logged into the platform. You can use [0-9a-f]{32} to discriminate it. Any subdomain of nr-ext.net, or, at the very least, to any domain in the shape of <NerdpackUuid>.g <NerdpackGid>.nr-ext.net, where <NerdpackUuid> is the UUID assigned to your package, and <NerdpackGid> is zero, or a positive integer. You can use 0|[1-9]\\d+ to discriminate it. Further reading Read the nr1 nerdpack:serve documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve --help",

      "body": "Subscribe to a Nerdpack to use it in the New Relic platform. Unsubscribe from Nerdpacks you no longer use. Check your permissions To subscribe to a Nerdpack, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can subscribe to them: Publish your Nerdpack Tag your Nerdpack if it's published and doesn't yet have a tag Subscribe to a Nerdpack Subscribe to a published Nerdpack, with either the web UI or the nr1 CLI, to use it in your account. Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack under New Relic One catalog: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the New Relic One catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel. Tip nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:unset. Read the nr1 subscription:unset documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:unset --help Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you subscribe to a Nerdpack, you may run into issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One app catalog. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start. You’re ready to build an application with the New Relic One CLI! Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the first four steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create and publish your Nerdpack Create a Nerdpack with a visualization. You'll add this visualization to a dashboard using NerdGraph. Further reading Because this guide is about using visualizations, not creating and publishing them, it breezes over these topics. If you're unfamiliar with visualizations or would like a thorough explanation of dealing with visualization Nerdpacks, check out the following resources: Introduction to custom visualizations Build your first custom visualization If you already have a visualization you'd like to add to a dashboard, you can skip this section. But don't forget to make the necessary code adjustments to reference your visualization instead of the one this guide uses, called my-awesome-visualization. Step 1 of 4 Update your nr1 CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Now, you have the latest version. Step 2 of 4 Create a visualization, called my-awesome-visualization, in a Nerdpack, called my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 create -t visualization -n my-awesome-visualization ✔ You’re trying to create a visualization outside of a Nerdpack. We’ll create a Nerdpack for you—what do you want to name it? … my-awesome-nerdpack ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-awesome-nerdpack is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization my-awesome-visualization is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization\" When you build a visualization with nr1 create, you get a default visualization. You'll use this default visualization throughout this course. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to your new Nerdpack: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack From here, you can run nr1 nerdpack commands. Step 4 of 4 Publish and subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Now, that your account is subscribed to your visualization, you can describe your app configurations with JSON and add it to a dashboard with NerdGraph. Describe your visualization options with JSON Whether you're adding your visualization to a new dashboard or an existing one, you need to send your configuration to NerdGraph. Your custom visualization JSON object represents a dashboard widget and consists of the following fields: Field Type Description title String Title for your dashboard widget visualization JSON The metadata for your visualization visualization.id String Your visualization's ID rawConfiguration JSON A full configuration of your widget Tip You can also add other types of widgets to dashboards with the steps in this guide, but the fields described here are specific to custom visualization widgets. For other widget types, you need to supply different data. Explore the API on your own with our NerdGraph explorer! Step 1 of 5 Start with a JSON template based on the fields you need to describe your custom visualization: { \"title\": \"\", \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"\" }, \"rawConfiguration\": {} } Copy Step 2 of 5 Give your visualization widget a title: { \"title\": \"My Awesome Visualization\", \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"\" }, \"rawConfiguration\": {} } Copy Step 3 of 5 Look up your Nerdpack ID from my-awesome-nerdpack/nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack my-awesome-nerdpack\" } my-awesome-nerdpack/nr1.json Copy Then, look up your visualization ID from my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"VISUALIZATION\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-visualization\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeVisualization\", \"description\": \"\", \"configuration\": [ { \"name\": \"nrqlQueries\", \"title\": \"NRQL Queries\", \"type\": \"collection\", \"items\": [ { \"name\": \"accountId\", \"title\": \"Account ID\", \"description\": \"Account ID to be associated with the query\", \"type\": \"account-id\" }, { \"name\": \"query\", \"title\": \"Query\", \"description\": \"NRQL query for visualization\", \"type\": \"nrql\" } ] }, { \"name\": \"fill\", \"title\": \"Fill color\", \"description\": \"A fill color to override the default fill color\", \"type\": \"string\" }, { \"name\": \"stroke\", \"title\": \"Stroke color\", \"description\": \"A stroke color to override the default stroke color\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json Copy Set your visualization widget's visualization.id to the form {NERDPACK-ID}.{VISUALIZATION-ID}: { \"title\": \"My Awesome Visualization\", \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, \"rawConfiguration\": {} } Copy Step 4 of 5 In my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json, review your configuration options: { \"schemaType\": \"VISUALIZATION\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-visualization\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeVisualization\", \"description\": \"\", \"configuration\": [ { \"name\": \"nrqlQueries\", \"title\": \"NRQL Queries\", \"type\": \"collection\", \"items\": [ { \"name\": \"accountId\", \"title\": \"Account ID\", \"description\": \"Account ID to be associated with the query\", \"type\": \"account-id\" }, { \"name\": \"query\", \"title\": \"Query\", \"description\": \"NRQL query for visualization\", \"type\": \"nrql\" } ] }, { \"name\": \"fill\", \"title\": \"Fill color\", \"description\": \"A fill color to override the default fill color\", \"type\": \"string\" }, { \"name\": \"stroke\", \"title\": \"Stroke color\", \"description\": \"A stroke color to override the default stroke color\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json Copy The name fields in configuration are important for describing your visualization widget. Step 5 of 5 Using the name field for every configuration object in your visualization's nr1.json file, build a rawConfiguration for your widget: { \"title\": \"My Awesome Visualization\", \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1234567, \"query\": \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], \"fill\": \"pink\", \"stroke\": \"green\" } } Copy Here, you've created a rawConfiguration by supplying values for each configuration option in nr1.json. Note that nrqlQueries is an array because its type is collection. The other values are strings. Learn more about these configuration options in Configure your custom visualization. Now that you've described your visualization widget in JSON, you can add your configured visualization to a dashboard. In the next section, you'll learn how to create a new dashboard with your visualization. If you already have one ready, skip ahead to add your visualization to your existing dashboard. Create a new dashboard with your visualization If you want to create a new dashboard for your visualization widget, use NerdGraph's dashboardCreate() mutation. The NerdGraph dashboardCreate() mutation takes the following fields: Field Type Description accountId Integer The ID for the account for which you want to create your dashboard dashboard JSON The details of the dashboard you're creating dashboard.name String The name of your dashboard dashboard.permissions Enum: PRIVATE, PUBLIC_READ_ONLY, PUBLIC_READ_WRITE The access control of your dashboard dashboard.pages Array: JSON The details of your dashboard's pages dashboard.pages[].name String The name of the dashboard page dashboard.pages[].widgets Array: JSON The widgets to add to the dashboard page Tip You can also pass more fields to dashboardCreate() to add details, widgets, and more. Explore the API on your own with our NerdGraph explorer! In this guide, you create a dashboard with a single page that contains a single widget—the visualization widget you described in the last section. Step 1 of 5 Build out a GraphQL mutation template based on the fields you need to describe your dashboard in dashboardCreate(): mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 0, dashboard: { name: \"\", pages: [ { name: \"\", widgets: [] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) } Copy Here, you've defined the template for a private dashboard. Now, it's time to fill in the details. Step 2 of 5 Look up your account ID and enter it for your accountId: mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1234567, dashboard: { name: \"\", pages: [ { name: \"\", widgets: [] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) } Copy Step 3 of 5 Select a name for your dashboard and its page: mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1234567, dashboard: { name: \"My Awesome Dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"One Page to Rule Them All\", widgets: [] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) } Copy Step 4 of 5 In widgets, place the widget object you created in the last section: mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1234567, dashboard: { name: \"My Awesome Dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"One Page to Rule Them All\", widgets: [ { title: \"My Awesome Visualization\", visualization: { id: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [ { accountId: 1234567, query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], fill: \"pink\", stroke: \"green\" } } ] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) } Copy Step 5 of 5 Finally, add the return fields to your mutation: mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1234567, dashboard: { name: \"My Awesome Dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"One Page to Rule Them All\", widgets: [ { title: \"My Awesome Visualization\", visualization: { id: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [ { accountId: 1234567, query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], fill: \"pink\", stroke: \"green\" } } ] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) { entityResult { guid } } } Copy Important Make sure you replace the IDs in your mutation query with ones that match your account, Nerdpack, and visualization. Now, you have a mutation ready to send to NerdGraph to create single-page dashboard with a widget for your custom visualization. As a result, you'll see the new dashboard's entity GUID. In the next section, you'll learn how to add your visualization to an existing dashboard. If that's not relevant to your goals, skip ahead to send your request to NerdGraph. Add your visualization to an existing dashboard To add your visualization widget to an existing dashboard, use NerdGraph's dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() mutation. The NerdGraph dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() mutation takes the following fields: Field Type Description guid String The entity GUID for the dashboard to which you're adding your widgets widgets Array: JSON The widgets to add to the dashboard page Tip You can also pass more fields to dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() to add details, widgets, and more. Explore the API on your own with our NerdGraph explorer! Step 1 of 4 Build out a GraphQL mutation template based on the fields you need to describe your dashboard in dashboardAddWidgetsToPage(): mutation { dashboardAddWidgetsToPage( guid: \"\" widgets: [] ) { errors { description } } } Copy Step 2 of 4 Look up your dashboard's GUID and enter it for guid: mutation { dashboardAddWidgetsToPage( guid: \"AbCdEFghIJkLMNo1PQRSTUVWXYZAbCD2Ef34GHI\" widgets: [] ) { errors { description } } } Copy Step 3 of 4 In widgets, place the widget object you created in Describe your visualization options with JSON: mutation { dashboardAddWidgetsToPage( guid: \"AbCdEFghIJkLMNo1PQRSTUVWXYZAbCD2Ef34GHI\" widgets: [ { visualization: { id: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [ { accountId: 1234567, query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], fill: \"pink\", stroke: \"green\" } }, ] ) } Copy Step 4 of 4 Finally, add the return fields to your mutation: mutation { dashboardAddWidgetsToPage( guid: \"AbCdEFghIJkLMNo1PQRSTUVWXYZAbCD2Ef34GHI\" widgets: [ { visualization: { id: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [ { accountId: 1234567, query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], fill: \"pink\", stroke: \"green\" } }, ] ) { errors { description } } } Copy Now, you have a mutation ready to send to NerdGraph to add your custom visualization to an existing dashboard. As a result, you'll see descriptions of any thrown errors to help you debug issues. The last thing you need to do is actually send your request to NerdGraph. Send your request to NerdGraph Send an HTTP request to NerdGraph with the payload you built in previous sections for the mutation that best suits your needs. There are many tools you can use to send an HTTP request, but in this guide, you learn how to communicate with NerdGraph using three specific tools: NerdGraph API explorer cURL New Relic CLI If you use another, you can adapt these methods for your favorite development tool. NerdGraph API explorer The NerdGraph API explorer is an implementation of GraphiQL that lets you explore the NerdGraph APIs. Step 1 of 4 Go to the NerdGraph API explorer. Step 2 of 4 Select or create a new API key: Step 3 of 4 In the center console, paste your mutation query: Important Make sure you replace the IDs in your mutation query with ones that match your account, Nerdpack, and visualization. Step 4 of 4 Press Execute Query and see the results in the right pane: If you successfully created a new dashboard, your response has an entity GUID. If you don't have an entity GUID, the response contains error messages to help you debug your query. If you added your visualization to an existing dashboard, you won't see errors in the response. If you do see error messages, use them to debug your query. Explore The NerdGraph API explorer lets you see other fields and change your query without typing everything manually. Use the left pane to explore NerdGraph. cURL cURL is a command line utility for making HTTP requests. Step 1 of 2 Select or create a New Relic user key. Copy this key, because you use it in the next step. Step 2 of 2 Make a request to NerdGraph, using cURL: bash Copy $ curl https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ > -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ > -H 'API-Key: <YOUR-USER-KEY>' \\ > --data-binary '{\"query\": \"mutation {dashboardCreate(dashboard: {name: \\\"My Awesome Dashboard\\\", pages: [{name: \\\"One Page to Rule Them All\\\", widgets: [{title: \\\"My Awesome Visualization\\\", visualization: {id: \\\"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\\\"}, rawConfiguration: {nrqlQueries: [{accountId: 3014918, query: \\\"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\\\"}], fill: \\\"pink\\\", stroke: \\\"green\\\"}}]}], permissions: PRIVATE}, accountId: <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID>) { entityResult { guid }}}\", \"variables\": \"\"}' Important Make sure you replace the IDs in your mutation query with ones that match your account, Nerdpack, and visualization. Here, you send a request to NerdGraph that has two headers, Content-Type and API-Key, and a binary message body containing one of the mutation queries you built in previous sections. If you prefer to use a UI-based client, like Postman, you can adapt this method to a format that your client supports. New Relic CLI The newrelic is a command line interface for reading and writing New Relic data. Step 1 of 2 If you haven't already, install newrelic by following the first two steps of our Get started with the New Relic CLI guide. Once you've done that, you will have newrelic installed and configured for making NerdGraph requests. Step 2 of 2 Make a NerdGraph request using newrelic nerdgraph query: bash Copy $ newrelic nerdgraph query 'mutation { $ dashboardCreate( $ accountId: 1234567, $ dashboard: { $ name: \"My Awesome Dashboard\", $ pages: [ $ { $ name: \"One Page to Rule Them All\", $ widgets: [ $ { $ title: \"My Awesome Visualization\", $ visualization: { $ id: \"de0b4768-1504-4818-a898-da7cd14f0bfb.my-awesome-visualization\" $ }, $ rawConfiguration: { $ nrqlQueries: [ $ { $ accountId: <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID>, $ query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" $ } $ ], $ fill: \"pink\", $ stroke: \"green\" $ } $ } $ ] $ }, $ ], $ permissions: PRIVATE $ } $ ) { $ entityResult { $ guid $ } $ } $ }' Important Make sure you replace the IDs in your mutation query with ones that match your account, Nerdpack, and visualization. View your new dashboard Now that you've built a dashboard with NerdGraph, it's time to check your work! Step 1 of 4 Go to New Relic. Step 2 of 4 Navigate to Dashboards: Step 3 of 4 Select your new dashboard: Step 4 of 4 View your dashboard: The dashboard you created has the name you passed in your mutation, \"My Awesome Dashboard\". It also has the configuration you sent in rawConfiguration, from the NRQL data query to the fill and stroke colors. Summary Congratulations!

These charts, offered out-of-the-box, are customizable in that you can: Resize and arrange their positions in your dashboard Update their names, display options, and underlying data queries But sometimes the charts we include in the platform aren't enough for you to get the most from your data. When you want to visualize your data in a specific way that isn't possible with our charts, you can build a custom visualization. New Relic is programmable. This means that if the platform doesn't solve your specific problem, you can write and deploy your own code to fill in some of those gaps. One area where programmability is valuable is in visualizing your data. While New Relic offers all the telemetry data that your apps and services report and provides many different kinds of charts to present that data, you might need to create something entirely unique. With the New Relic One SDK, we've provided you all the tools you'll need to create your own visualizations. Build your custom visualization With the New Relic One SDK, you can create a Nerdpack, which houses your visualization code. This code consists of a React component, logic, data queries, and external dependencies. The SDK also provides a component library that you can use to make NerdGraph requests, access platform state context, and more. Your first visualization To build your first custom visualization, install the New Relic One SDK and make sure you have the latest version: bash Copy $ nr1 update Create a Nerdpack and a visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name custom-viz ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ...my-first-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-first-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization custom-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz/visualizations/custom-viz\" The visualization you created in the my-first-viz Nerdpack contains a default component to help you get started. Serve your visualization locally: bash Copy $ cd my-first-viz $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ custom-viz https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Important To view the locally served visualization, you must use the nerdpacks=local querystring. Enter values into the fields under Configure visualization properties and see how the chart changes: Resources Here is a list of resources for building custom visualizations: Build a custom visualization for dashboards (Guide) Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK (Guide) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Customize your visualization You have a lot of control over how your visualization operates. You can choose what properties of the visualization are customizable, such as colors, sizes, and how you present your legend. You can choose whether it presents New Relic data or data from an external source. You can even install and use third-party components to create a specific look: Resources Here is a list of resources for configuring custom visualizations: Configuration options (Documentation) Customize visualizations with configuration (Guide) Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (Video) Use your custom visualization During development, you can serve your visualization locally. Under Apps > Custom Visualizations, you can view and configure your visualization to see how your data looks, but you can't instantiate that chart and use it in your account: To do that, you need to publish it to the New Relic One catalog and subscribe to it from your account. Because custom visualizations are Nerdpack artifacts, you publish and subscribe to them the same way you publish and subscribe to New Relic One applications. Once you've done so, you can add your custom visualization to a dashboard: If you want to reuse your visualization to present different data or the same data in a new way, you can go back to Apps > Custom Visualizations, choose your visualization, configure another instance and add it to your dashboard: Resources Here is a list of resources for using custom visualizations: Add custom visualizations to your dashboards (Documentation) New Relic Dashboards and Custom Visualizations: Flexibility with Less Toil (Blog) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (Video)",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One app catalog. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

      "info": "Build a \"Hello, World!\" app and publish it to New Relic One",
      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have accounts in GitHub and New Relic. To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in the New Relic One Catalog, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another. Step 4 of 4 In index.js, change your component's Radar.fillOpacity: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 } from 'recharts'; 10 import {Card, CardBody, HeadingText, NrqlQuery, Spinner, AutoSizer} from 'nr1'; 11 12 export default class MyAwesomeVisualizationVisualization extends React.Component { 13 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 14 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Before you begin Explore our custom visualization guides and build your first visualization. After you're done, you'll have a better foundation for building more complex visualizations, such as the one you'll build in this course.

Step 1 of 3 Import Treemap from recharts: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 'Radar': 'radar', 24 'Treemap': 'treemap' 25 } 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

You'll use your own machine's resources, but you'll see the Nerdpack in the New Relic platform as you would if it were published. Serve your Nerdpack locally Step 1 of 5 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run the nerdpack:serve command: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve If you've successfully served your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! While your Nerdpack is being served locally, the server will automatically reload your Nerdpack when it detects that you've modified a file. This doesn't include the metadata file nr1.json or the styles file styles.css. If you update those files, you need to stop your local server with CTRL+C and restart it with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 5 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local: New Relic requires the ?nerdpacks=local query string to load locally served Nerdpacks. Step 3 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Whether you're creating a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Apps. Step 4 of 5 If you're serving a Nerdpack with a launcher and a Nerdlet, you'll find your local app under Your apps: If you're serving a Nerdpack with a visualization, go to Favorite apps > Custom Visualizations: Tip If Custom Visualizations isn't favorited, you can find it under Your apps. From Custom Visualizations, you'll see your visualization: Whether you're serving a Nerdpack for an app or a visualization, you'll see a </> Local indicator on its UI tile. Use this to distinguish between published Nerdpacks and locally served Nerdpacks. Step 5 of 5 When you're ready to stop serving your Nerdpack locally, type CTRL+C into your terminal where the server is running. Resolve issues with accessing your local Nerdpack Sometimes, when you serve your Nerdpack locally, you may come across issues. You may be unable to serve your Nerdpack because of bugs in your code. Or, you may successfully serve your Nerdpack but be unable to find it in New Relic. Consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your application When you attempt to serve your Nerdpack locally, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve --verbose Show locally served Nerdpacks If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, make sure you're using the ?nerdpacks=local query string. If you're not, New Relic won't load your locally served Nerdpack on the platform. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you serve your Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:serve, you must be signed into the same profile in New Relic that you're serving with locally. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic and you're using the correct query string, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same. Access your proxy browser Generally, you don't need to know how your application code is loaded in New Relic. But understanding how it works can help you resolve issues with your local server. When you run nr1 nerdpack:serve, your code is served by your local machine using an nr-local.net subdomain. This domain points to 127.0.0.1, and uses a variety of ports to connect, including 9973. To load a Nerdpack into the platform, whether it's locally served or published to the app catalog, New Relic uses an <IFRAME> and a separate domain (a subdomain of nr-ext.net), relying on same-domain policy to sandbox the code. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, you're using the correct query string, and you're using the correct profile, your network administrator may need to enable access to: Any subdomain of nr-local.net, or, at the very least, to any domain of the shape of <UserId>.nr-local.net, where <UserId> is a 32-hexadecimal character identifier that is unique to the user logged into the platform. You can use [0-9a-f]{32} to discriminate it. Any subdomain of nr-ext.net, or, at the very least, to any domain in the shape of <NerdpackUuid>.g <NerdpackGid>.nr-ext.net, where <NerdpackUuid> is the UUID assigned to your package, and <NerdpackGid> is zero, or a positive integer. You can use 0|[1-9]\\d+ to discriminate it. Further reading Read the nr1 nerdpack:serve documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve --help",

      "body": "There are several restrictions around who can publish, use, and subscribe to Nerdpacks (the file packages that represent New Relic One applications). Restrictions for basic users The most important permissions factor is user type. A basic user has several restrictions related to their inability to access Full Stack Observability, and a full user theoretically has full abilities. Basic users can build and serve their own Nerdpacks locally. They can also use public Nerdpacks that meet both of the following criteria: New Relic must have specifically allowed basic users to use the Nerdpack Someone else on the basic user's account must have already subscribed to the Nerdpack Nerdpacks that basic users can use are rare. Basic users can't: Publish the Nerdpacks they build Tag their Nerdpacks Subscribe an account to a Nerdpack Use private Nerdpacks (including their own) Use public Nerdpacks that New Relic hasn't specifically allowed them to use Full users can use any Nerdpacks that the account they're in has been subscribed to, whether built by New Relic or others. Full users theoretically have Nerdpack management permissions, but there may be restrictions related to custom role assignments (see below). Role-related restrictions For full users, there are role-related rules that may impact one's ability to manage Nerdpacks (publish them and subscribe to them). How this works depends on your account/user model: Original user model: Owners and Admins can manage Nerdpacks, as can users specifically assigned the Nerdpack manager add-on role. For more details about how account access works for users, see Account access New Relic One user model: the ability to manage Nerdpacks is dependent on the \"modify Nerdpacks\" capability. That capability is included in the All product admin role, which both the default Admin and User groups have. And it can also be assigned to a custom role. To learn more about account/user models, see User model overview. Account access For organizations with master/sub-account structures: If you subscribe to a Nerdpack from a master account, that access is inherited by all of its sub-accounts. A Nerdpack made by your team can only be subscribed to from the master account that was used to publish it, or from its sub-accounts. This means that, if the Nerdpack needs to be available across your organization, you may need a New Relic admin to deploy it.",

      "body": "When you create a dashboard, you add a variety of charts to visualize your New Relic telemetry data. These charts, offered out-of-the-box, are customizable in that you can: Resize and arrange their positions in your dashboard Update their names, display options, and underlying data queries But sometimes the charts we include in the platform aren't enough for you to get the most from your data. When you want to visualize your data in a specific way that isn't possible with our charts, you can build a custom visualization. New Relic is programmable. This means that if the platform doesn't solve your specific problem, you can write and deploy your own code to fill in some of those gaps. One area where programmability is valuable is in visualizing your data. While New Relic offers all the telemetry data that your apps and services report and provides many different kinds of charts to present that data, you might need to create something entirely unique. With the New Relic One SDK, we've provided you all the tools you'll need to create your own visualizations. Build your custom visualization With the New Relic One SDK, you can create a Nerdpack, which houses your visualization code. This code consists of a React component, logic, data queries, and external dependencies. The SDK also provides a component library that you can use to make NerdGraph requests, access platform state context, and more. Your first visualization To build your first custom visualization, install the New Relic One SDK and make sure you have the latest version: bash Copy $ nr1 update Create a Nerdpack and a visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name custom-viz ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ...my-first-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-first-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization custom-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz/visualizations/custom-viz\" The visualization you created in the my-first-viz Nerdpack contains a default component to help you get started. Serve your visualization locally: bash Copy $ cd my-first-viz $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ custom-viz https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Important To view the locally served visualization, you must use the nerdpacks=local querystring. Enter values into the fields under Configure visualization properties and see how the chart changes: Resources Here is a list of resources for building custom visualizations: Build a custom visualization for dashboards (Guide) Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK (Guide) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Customize your visualization You have a lot of control over how your visualization operates. You can choose what properties of the visualization are customizable, such as colors, sizes, and how you present your legend. You can choose whether it presents New Relic data or data from an external source. You can even install and use third-party components to create a specific look: Resources Here is a list of resources for configuring custom visualizations: Configuration options (Documentation) Customize visualizations with configuration (Guide) Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (Video) Use your custom visualization During development, you can serve your visualization locally. Under Apps > Custom Visualizations, you can view and configure your visualization to see how your data looks, but you can't instantiate that chart and use it in your account: To do that, you need to publish it to the New Relic One catalog and subscribe to it from your account. Because custom visualizations are Nerdpack artifacts, you publish and subscribe to them the same way you publish and subscribe to New Relic One applications. Once you've done so, you can add your custom visualization to a dashboard: If you want to reuse your visualization to present different data or the same data in a new way, you can go back to Apps > Custom Visualizations, choose your visualization, configure another instance and add it to your dashboard: Resources Here is a list of resources for using custom visualizations: Add custom visualizations to your dashboards (Documentation) New Relic Dashboards and Custom Visualizations: Flexibility with Less Toil (Blog) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (Video)",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Create a Nerdpack, before starting this one. When you build a New Relic One application, it's valuable to view it on the platform. This helps you design, implement, and debug your application in the environment it will eventually be published to. With nr1, you can launch a development server that hosts your application so that New Relic One can present it to you. Step 1 of 4 From inside the Nerdpack's root directory, serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve When the Nerdpack has succeeded building and your application is ready to view, you'll see a message with a link to New Relic One: bash Copy ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! Notice the appended query parameter nerdpacks=local. This query parameter tells New Relic to show locally served Nerdpacks. Tip If you don't see your application on the New Relic platform, make sure you've included nerdpacks=local in your querystring! Step 2 of 4 Navigate to the provided url. From the home page, select Apps to view New Relic One applications: Step 3 of 4 Under the Your apps section, find your launcher, called \"A/B Test Launcher\": Step 4 of 4 Select your launcher to see your root Nerdlet and its default welcome message: Tip Here, you've seen how to access your Nerdlet from a launcher. If you want your Nerdlet closer to your data, you can also attach your Nerdlet to New Relic entities. Congratulations, you've served your first New Relic One application! Notice, in the command's output, that the server reloads when you change files in your Nerdpack.

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

When you build a New Relic One application, it's valuable to view it on the platform. This helps you design, implement, and debug your application in the environment it will eventually be published to. With nr1, you can launch a development server that hosts your application so that New Relic One can present it to you. Step 1 of 4 From inside the Nerdpack's root directory, serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve When the Nerdpack has succeeded building and your application is ready to view, you'll see a message with a link to New Relic One: bash Copy ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! Notice the appended query parameter nerdpacks=local. This query parameter tells New Relic to show locally served Nerdpacks. Tip If you don't see your application on the New Relic platform, make sure you've included nerdpacks=local in your querystring!

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add version descriptions, before starting this one. In this course, you’re building an A/B test application in New Relic. The application presents a lot of data, through its charts, about the effectiveness of each design version you’re testing on your demo website. Ultimately, you’ll be able to use that data to decide which design is most effective and show that design to every user who visits your site. In this lesson, you’ll build a form into your application that lets you choose which design you want to show to every user of your site. Before writing any code, look at your design guide to review the section you’re going to build: This new section has three main components: A heading with instructional copy: \"Pick a version to end the test\" A component that you use to crown the winning version of the A/B test A button to confirm the winner that you selected Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-end-test-section/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named end-test.js: bash Copy $ touch end-test.js Step 3 of 10 In this new file, create a VersionSelector component to encapsulate a Select and its SelectItem child components: import React from 'react'; import { Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy VersionSelector renders a Select component with two choices. In each SelectItem, you specify a value prop. In this case, you use 'A' to represent version A and 'B' to represent version B. Step 4 of 10 Create another component for a Button you'll use to make your test as ended: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy This looks trivial, but it will encapsulate button logic as you iterate on your app code. Step 5 of 10 Create a final component for the entire section you'll use to mark the end of your test: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you create a Grid with three items. First, you create a GridItem that contains a HeadingText and spans all 12 columns. In the next row, you have two items: The VersionSelector component you created in the previous step A Button which reads \"End test\" These items each span one column, but instead of using columnSpan, they use a combination of columnStart and columnEnd to specify which columns they cover. Step 6 of 10 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, add EndTestSection to your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. However, you need to make a few improvements to this code. When you select a version, the selected value in the component doesn't change. You must control the value that Select displays using its value prop and onChange event handler. In the next lesson, you’ll update your code to persist your version choice in the Select component. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Persist the selected version.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Install and configure the New Relic One CLI, before starting this one. A Nerdpack is a package that contains all the files that make up a New Relic One application or visualization. Nerdpacks include files for metadata, Nerdlets, assets, and more. To create a Nerdpack, use the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack When nr1 prompts for a component name, use \"ab-test\" and watch the tool create the foundations of your Nerdpack. Once it's finished, explore the files it created for you. Root directory At the root level, you have a directory called ab-test. Everything inside this directory is part of the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls ab-test README.md nerdlets nr1.json package.json launchers node_modules package-lock.json Readme.md provides instructions for creating Nerdpack elements and serving your application locally. This and nr1 --help are useful if you forget how to interact with your Nerdpack using the command line tool. Javascript files package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules are important for running your JavaScript application, but aren't unique to Nerdpacks. You can learn about these modules from JavaScript courses should you need to tweak them. For now, take a look at nr1.json, one of the most relevant files in this directory. Metadata file nr1.json is the Nerdpack's metadata file, containing a schema type, unique identifier, a display name, and a description. Since you’re building a New Relic One application for running and analyzing A/B tests, update the package's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and set the description to \"A/B test your application using New Relic One\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"311bcd0c-f7eb-4285-afed-4219179bf91d\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"A/B test your application using New Relic One.\" } nr1.json Copy It's good to describe your application's purpose, especially if you're going to publish your application for others to use. Next, look at the launchers and nerdlets subdirectories. Launchers launchers is a directory because you can create multiple launchers for your New Relic One application. nr1 create only created one launcher for your Nerdpack and called it \"ab-test-launcher\". Inside its directory, there are two files: icon.png is an image that represents the application nr1.json is the launcher's metadata file Use \"A/B Test Launcher\" for the launcher's displayName and \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\" for the description in nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"ab-test-launcher\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test Launcher\", \"description\": \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\" } launchers/ab-test-launcher/nr1.json Copy Notice that the launcher has a rootNerdletId. This identifies the Nerdlet that the launcher opens when it's selected. This Nerdpack has only one Nerdlet, called ab-test-nerdlet, but some Nerdpacks may have multiple. Make sure that you set the rootNerdletId to the Nerdlet you want the launcher to open. Nerdlets The nerdlets directory contains all the Nerdlets that make up your New Relic One application. Since ab-test-nerdlet is the only Nerdlet in this Nerdpack, there is only one subdirectory. In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, there are three files: index.js is the JavaScript file that contains your Nerdlet component styles.scss holds the Sass stylesheet for your Nerdlet nr1.json contains the Nerdlet's metadata Update your Nerdlet's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and description to \"Control and view results of your A/B test\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"Control and view results of your A/B test\" } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Now, you've customized your Nerdpack, Nerdlet, and launcher with informative display names and descriptions, but what does your application actually do? Check out index.js to see what your default Nerdlet looks like: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, ab-test-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you have AbTestNerdletNerdlet, which nr1 created for you. It's a React component that renders a first-level welcome heading. Because this is the root Nerdlet, as specified in your launcher's nr1.json file, when you click on your launcher in the New Relic platform, the launcher will open a view that displays this heading. Tip In this lesson, you used nr1 create to create a Nerdpack, complete with a launcher and a Nerdlet. If you want to create another Nerdlet or Launcher in your Nerdpack, you can also do that with nr1 create: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdlet $ nr1 create --type launcher You can even skip the --type flag and select an option from a list: bash Copy $ nr1 create ? What kind of component do you want to create? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit. nerdpack ❯ nerdlet - create a/an Nerdlet artifact inside your Nerdpack. launcher catalog visualization In the next lesson, you'll learn how to serve your Nerdpack locally and see your app in action!

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add your first chart, before starting this one. You’ve begun building your A/B test application. So far, it consists of a single line chart, which represents the number of subscriptions your newsletter receives from each version of your website. To understand what you’ll build in this lesson, review the design guide to remember what charts come next: In the design, there are two pie charts beneath the line chart that you’ve already created. One represents the distribution of users who receive version A and version B. The other represents the distribution of successful requests from users who got version A and version B. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-pie-charts/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add two new Javascript files: total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js bash Copy $ touch total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js Step 3 of 9 In total-subscriptions.js, create a component, called TotalSubscriptions, which renders mocked subscription data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Notice that the series data is formatted differently for PieChart than it was for LineChart. Because PieChart uses unidimensional data, its series only take y-values. Step 4 of 9 In total-cancellations.js, create a component, called TotalCancellations, which renders mocked cancellation data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new components and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the PieChart components displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Your application is starting to take shape. You’ve created a line chart and two pie charts. For now, these charts use mocked data, but you’ll provide them real data in a later lesson. Before you focus on the data in your charts, however, you’ll learn how to add a table to your application so you can visualize data in a new way. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. When you're ready, continue on to the next lesson: Add tables.",

      "info": "Build a \"Hello, World!\" app and publish it to New Relic One",
      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have accounts in GitHub and New Relic. To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in the New Relic One Catalog, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One app catalog. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start.

      "body": "Subscribe to a Nerdpack to use it in the New Relic platform. Unsubscribe from Nerdpacks you no longer use. Check your permissions To subscribe to a Nerdpack, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can subscribe to them: Publish your Nerdpack Tag your Nerdpack if it's published and doesn't yet have a tag Subscribe to a Nerdpack Subscribe to a published Nerdpack, with either the web UI or the nr1 CLI, to use it in your account. Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack under New Relic One catalog: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the New Relic One catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel. Tip nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:unset. Read the nr1 subscription:unset documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:unset --help Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you subscribe to a Nerdpack, you may run into issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the New Relic One catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published to the catalog, you can view it by visiting the Apps page of New Relic: From the catalog UI, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top right of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app in the catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

      "body": "Use New Relic's metrics API service to define rules for creating metrics from your other types of data, such as events, logs, or spans. Recommendation: Before you begin, review our requirements and tips for creating rules. Create a metrics rule To create a rule for creating metrics from events, logs, or spans: Construct the metrics rule using NRQL. Construct a NerdGraph (GraphQL format) API request that contains your NRQL rule. Create the metric by making the API request. Once a metric is created, you can query and chart it using NRQL. Step 1. Create NRQL query rule The most important part of creating a metrics rule is constructing the NRQL query that defines the metric for your data from events, logs, or spans. You can create up to 10 metrics with a single NRQL query by following this procedure: Using New Relic's NRQL interface, construct a query for the metric you want to create. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT average(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy Edit the query to use one of the three available metric types: summary: Use if the query's function is min, max, sum, count, or average. uniqueCount: Use if the query's function is uniqueCount. distribution: Use if the query's function is percentile or histogram. This example query uses average, so use summary: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary (ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy This example query uses count on a non-numeric field: FROM ProcessSample SELECT count(hostname) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy For summary on a non-numeric field use summary(1): FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(1) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy Tip For more detailed information on using these metric types in rules, see Creating metric rules: requirements and tips. Decide on the attributes you want to attach to the metric, following the limits on the cardinality of unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations. Recommendation: Run a separate query to ensure this count isn't over 50,000 for a 24-hour window. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT uniqueCount(awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy To be able to aggregate and filter your metrics, add the attributes you want to attach to the metric using the FACET clause. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Set the name of the metric using the AS function. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Once your NRQL rule is complete, use it to create the API request. Step 2. Create API request After you build the NRQL rule to convert data from events, logs, or spans to metrics, continue with building the API request. You can use our NerdGraph API tool to explore the data structure and to construct and make your request. To check that the rule was created correctly, you can run a query to return that rule using its ID. For tips on querying the metrics you've created, see Query and chart your metrics. Example NerdGraph API request The following example NerdGraph API request uses the same NRQL rule from step 1. The IO Total Read Bytes Rule creates a metric named io.totalread.bytes. (The rule name can have spaces, which differs from the metric naming rules.) mutation { eventsToMetricsCreateRule(rules: { name: \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", description:\"Created by Zach on March 27, 2019. Used by team Network.\", nrql:\"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\", accountId: 123456 }) { successes { id name nrql enabled } failures { submitted { name nrql accountId } errors { reason description } } } } Copy In this request: Request elements Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsCreateRule The method being called to create a rule. rules Takes four parameters: name: The name of the rule. description: Optional. The description of the rule. We recommend you include information about who created the metric data and who will be using the data. accountId: The New Relic account ID where the events, logs, or spans live and the metrics will be created. nrql: The NRQL query that creates the rule. For more on this, see Create NRQL query. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a successful or failed response. Available parameters for these blocks include: id (ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled (enabled/disabled status) accountId ruleId and accountId If a failure occurs, then the submitted ruleId and accountId will be returned along with the error reason and error description. Example NerdGraph API response Here's an example of a returned response: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsCreateRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"46\", \"name\": \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", \"nrql\": \"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\" } ] } } } Copy Step 3. Create a metrics rule with API request When your API request is ready, you can use the NerdGraph API to make the request, which will create the metrics. Query and chart your metrics After you create a metrics rule to convert data for your events, logs, or spans, you can view the new metric data in the New Relic UI. To view your data: Go to New Relic's NRQL query interface. Run the following query to see the name of all your metrics: SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric Copy Pick the metric of interest, then run the following query to see the available attributes: SELECT * FROM Metric where metricName = 'yourMetric' Copy If you don't see expected data, follow the troubleshooting procedures. The available NRQL aggregator functions depend on the metric type you created. Here are some examples. Summary metric example If you created a summary metric type, you can use the count, sum, max, min, and average aggregator functions, as shown in the following query: SELECT count(appStartResponseTime), sum(appStartResponseTime), max(appStartResponseTime), min(appStartResponseTime), average(appStartResponseTime) FROM Metric Copy Count metric example If you created a uniqueCount metric type, you can only use the uniqueCount function, as shown in the following query: SELECT uniqueCount(playbackErrorStreamUniqueCount) * 100 / uniqueCount(streamUniqueCount) AS '% of Streams Impacted' FROM Metric Copy Distribution metric example If you created a distribution metric type, use the percentile or histogram functions, as shown in the following queries: SELECT percentile(service.responseTime, 95) FROM Metric Copy OR SELECT histogram(service.responseTime, 10, 20) FROM Metric Copy Troubleshooting If your NerdGraph call is not constructed correctly, you may receive a message like this: Cannot parse the unexpected character \"\\u201C” Copy Verify the quotes in the NerdGraph call are not smart quotes (curly quotes). Our NerdGraph API only accepts straight quotes.",

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that each require their own type of API key to use. This resource describes our API keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. Manage API keys in UI Here's a direct link to the API keys UI page. To find this from the New Relic UI: From the account dropdown, select Account settings. Select API keys. Overview of API keys The table below summarizes our available API keys and their uses. Important Some keys are able to be used by more than one API. If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. Key type What it's for Where to access User key (Also known as a \"personal API key\") Used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints (dependent on user permissions). API keys UI License key Allows ingestion of data from APM agents, the infrastructure agent, and some other data-ingest APIs. API keys UI Insights insert key (Also known as a \"Insert key\") Allows ingestion of events via HTTPS request from our metric, log, trace, and event APIs and the tools that use those APIs. Go to the API keys UI and click Insights insert key. Browser key Allows ingestion of browser monitoring data. API keys UI Mobile key (aka \"mobile app token\") Allows mobile monitoring data to be sent to New Relic. See Mobile app token. REST API key Note: we recommend using the user key instead because it has fewer limitations. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, Browser, Infrastructure alerts, as well as Mobile REST APIs and the API Explorer. Go to the API keys UI and click REST API key. Admin API key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. For more information, see Admin key and User key below. API keys UI (will appear as user keys) Insights query key (aka \"Query key\") This key allows use of the Insights query API. Note: we now recommend using NerdGraph to query New Relic data. Go to the API keys UI and click Insights query key. User key New Relic user keys (previously referred to as \"personal API keys\") are required for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API), which allows you to query most New Relic data and do some types of configuration. User keys also let you use our REST API, with restrictions based on your permissions. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a user key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select User. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key. In the Notes field, add relevant details about the key. Click Create. Edit a user key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the user key you want to edit, click ... and select Edit. Make your changes and click Update key. Delete a user key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the user key you want to delete, click ... and select Delete. Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. Tip In December 2020, user keys supplanted Admin API keys. For details, see Admin API key. License key New Relic license keys allow the ingestion of data from APM agents, the infrastructure agent, and some other data-ingest APIs. If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required or recommended. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a license key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select License. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key. In the Notes field, add relevant details about the key. Click Create. Edit a license key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the license key you want to edit, click ... and select Edit. Make your changes and click Update key. Delete a license API key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the license key you want to delete, click ... and select Delete. Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. Important You can't manage or delete an original license key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Browser key The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. The instructions below are for managing keys in the UI. For managing keys via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. Create a browser key Go to the API keys UI and click Create key. In the Account dropdown, choose the account for which you want the key to be created. In the Key type dropdown, select Browser. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your key. In the Notes field, add relevant details about the key. Click Create. Edit a browser key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the browser API key you want to edit, click ... and select Edit. Make your changes and click Update key. Delete a browser key Go to the API keys UI. In the row of the browser API key you want to delete, click ... and select Delete. Click Delete key to confirm your deletion. Important You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. REST API key Important We recommend using a user key to use the REST API because that key has fewer limitations. You can use a REST API key with our REST API and the API Explorer. For parent accounts with sub-accounts, each sub-account must use its own REST API key. Availability: Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. Activate or change REST API key Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Click Regenerate REST API key. Click (Show key) to view your account's new REST API key. Copy your account's REST API key to use with New Relic's REST API. View REST API keys To view REST API keys: Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Click (Show key) to view your account's new REST API key. Delete REST API key To delete your account's REST API key: Before you delete an API key, make sure you have the correct account or sub-account. Go to the API keys UI and select REST API key. Select the delete icon for the REST API key. Confirm the deletion by typing DELETION IS FOREVER in the text field. Select Delete. Insights insert key The Insights insert key (aka the \"Insert key\") is required for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. Generate an Insights insert key Go to the API keys UI and select Insights insert keys. Next to the Insert keys heading, select the button. A cURL command containing your insert key will appear, as well as NRQL query field. Edit the NRQL query field. Add comments in the Notes field if desired. Click Save your notes. Edit or delete an Insights insert key Go to the API keys UI and select Insights insert keys. Under Insert Keys, find the key you want to modify. Select Edit or Delete. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. Generate an Insights query key You must have access to the UIs you plan to query and the correct permissions in order to register or modify this key. Important Insights query keys are generated per account; they're not associated with a specific user. This means that any user in an account with access to a query key can use it. To register this key: Go to the API keys UI and select Insights query keys. Next to the Query Keys heading, select the button. A cURL command containing your insert key will appear, as well as NRQL query field. Edit the NRQL query field. Add comments in the Notes field if desired. Click Save your notes. Edit or delete an Insights query key To edit or delete this key: Go to the API keys UI page and select Insights query keys. Under Query Keys, find the key you want to modify. Select Edit or Delete. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily.",

      "body": "When you create a dashboard, you add a variety of charts to visualize your New Relic telemetry data. These charts, offered out-of-the-box, are customizable in that you can: Resize and arrange their positions in your dashboard Update their names, display options, and underlying data queries But sometimes the charts we include in the platform aren't enough for you to get the most from your data. When you want to visualize your data in a specific way that isn't possible with our charts, you can build a custom visualization. New Relic is programmable. This means that if the platform doesn't solve your specific problem, you can write and deploy your own code to fill in some of those gaps. One area where programmability is valuable is in visualizing your data. While New Relic offers all the telemetry data that your apps and services report and provides many different kinds of charts to present that data, you might need to create something entirely unique. With the New Relic One SDK, we've provided you all the tools you'll need to create your own visualizations. Build your custom visualization With the New Relic One SDK, you can create a Nerdpack, which houses your visualization code. This code consists of a React component, logic, data queries, and external dependencies. The SDK also provides a component library that you can use to make NerdGraph requests, access platform state context, and more. Your first visualization To build your first custom visualization, install the New Relic One SDK and make sure you have the latest version: bash Copy $ nr1 update Create a Nerdpack and a visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name custom-viz ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ...my-first-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-first-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization custom-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz/visualizations/custom-viz\" The visualization you created in the my-first-viz Nerdpack contains a default component to help you get started. Serve your visualization locally: bash Copy $ cd my-first-viz $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ custom-viz https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Important To view the locally served visualization, you must use the nerdpacks=local querystring. Enter values into the fields under Configure visualization properties and see how the chart changes: Resources Here is a list of resources for building custom visualizations: Build a custom visualization for dashboards (Guide) Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK (Guide) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Customize your visualization You have a lot of control over how your visualization operates. You can choose what properties of the visualization are customizable, such as colors, sizes, and how you present your legend. You can choose whether it presents New Relic data or data from an external source. You can even install and use third-party components to create a specific look: Resources Here is a list of resources for configuring custom visualizations: Configuration options (Documentation) Customize visualizations with configuration (Guide) Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (Video) Use your custom visualization During development, you can serve your visualization locally. Under Apps > Custom Visualizations, you can view and configure your visualization to see how your data looks, but you can't instantiate that chart and use it in your account: To do that, you need to publish it to the New Relic One catalog and subscribe to it from your account. Because custom visualizations are Nerdpack artifacts, you publish and subscribe to them the same way you publish and subscribe to New Relic One applications. Once you've done so, you can add your custom visualization to a dashboard: If you want to reuse your visualization to present different data or the same data in a new way, you can go back to Apps > Custom Visualizations, choose your visualization, configure another instance and add it to your dashboard: Resources Here is a list of resources for using custom visualizations: Add custom visualizations to your dashboards (Documentation) New Relic Dashboards and Custom Visualizations: Flexibility with Less Toil (Blog) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (Video)",

Check your permissions When you publish your Nerdpack, it's registered with the New Relic One catalog. From there, some users can subscribe to your Nerdpack. Subscribing users need to have: Access to the account that published the Nerdpack The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Update your package version You can only publish a package version to the catalog one time. For example, you can't publish two instances of version 1.0.0. So, each time you want to deploy a new version of your code, you need to increment its version in the Nerdpack's package.json file: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy Tip Nerdpack versions follow semantic versioning. Read the documentation to learn more. Generate a UUID for your Nerdpack If you built your Nerdpack from scratch with nr1 create --type nerdpack, then your Nerdpack has a unique identifier. Find this identifier in the root directory's nr1.json file: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"DemoApp\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack demo-app\" } nr1.json Copy This ID must be unique to your Nerdpack when you publish it to the catalog. The platform will reject your Nerdpack if it recognizes the ID. So, if you cloned an existing Nerdpack or are otherwise using open source code, generate a new UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --generate --force Tip Read the nr1 nerdpack:uuid documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --help Publish your Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish If you've successfully published your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This output describes the published Nerdpack. First, it states the Nerdpack's ID (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890). Then, its version (1.0.0). Finally, its version tag (STABLE). You already managed your Nerdpack's ID and version, but the version tag is new. To manage your Nerdpack's versions, you can tag them with an arbitrary tag. For example, if a version is still in development, you can tag it with a DEV tag. If the version moves to a QA phase, you can tag it with QA. If it's ready for production, you can tag it with STABLE. Tip Read our tag guide to learn more. Use the -t or --tag option to publish your Nerdpack with a tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag DEV As you saw in the nr1 nerdpack:publish output, if you don't pass a tag, nr1 applies the STABLE tag automatically. However, you can tell it to not apply any tags to a release with the -T or --skip-tag option: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --skip-tag You can also perform a dry run to make sure you publish your Nerdpack the way you want to: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --dry-run Step 2 of 4 Once you've successfully published your Nerdpack, go to New Relic: Because you're going to view a published Nerdpack, rather than a locally served one, you don't need to pass the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to Apps: Whether you published a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Apps. Step 4 of 4 Find your published Nerdpack under New Relic One catalog: Notice the Custom indicator on its UI tile. Use this to distinguish between published Nerdpacks and locally-served Nerdpacks. Tip Only Nerdpacks with tagged versions are shown under New Relic One catalog. So, if you published without a tag or removed a tag from your published Nerdpack, you won't see it in the catalog. Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you publish your Nerdpack, you may come across issues. Whether you can't publish your Nerdpack due to some issue with your code or you can't find your Nerdpack in the catalog, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your command When you attempt to publish your Nerdpack, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. For example: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack DemoApp (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890) › Error: There is already a Nerdpack with given id & version. › Code: 409 It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --verbose Reveal your published Nerdpack information If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, it may not be tagged. Remember, at least one version of your published Nerdpack must have a tag for it to show on the Apps page. See more information about your published Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:info: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 3014918 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 3 hours ago In this example, there is one published version, but it isn't tagged. You can tag a published version with: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --from-version=1.0.0 --tag=DEV Now, if you refresh your browser page, you should see your Nerdpack on Apps. Tip Read our nr1 nerdpack:tag documentation to learn more. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you publish your Nerdpack, only users who can access your account can see your published Nerdpack. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic but you know it's published, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same.",

      "body": "Subscribe to a Nerdpack to use it in the New Relic platform. Unsubscribe from Nerdpacks you no longer use. Check your permissions To subscribe to a Nerdpack, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can subscribe to them: Publish your Nerdpack Tag your Nerdpack if it's published and doesn't yet have a tag Subscribe to a Nerdpack Subscribe to a published Nerdpack, with either the web UI or the nr1 CLI, to use it in your account. Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack under New Relic One catalog: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the New Relic One catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel. Tip nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:unset. Read the nr1 subscription:unset documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:unset --help Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you subscribe to a Nerdpack, you may run into issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

      "body": "There are several restrictions around who can publish, use, and subscribe to Nerdpacks (the file packages that represent New Relic One applications). Restrictions for basic users The most important permissions factor is user type. A basic user has several restrictions related to their inability to access Full Stack Observability, and a full user theoretically has full abilities. Basic users can build and serve their own Nerdpacks locally. They can also use public Nerdpacks that meet both of the following criteria: New Relic must have specifically allowed basic users to use the Nerdpack Someone else on the basic user's account must have already subscribed to the Nerdpack Nerdpacks that basic users can use are rare. Basic users can't: Publish the Nerdpacks they build Tag their Nerdpacks Subscribe an account to a Nerdpack Use private Nerdpacks (including their own) Use public Nerdpacks that New Relic hasn't specifically allowed them to use Full users can use any Nerdpacks that the account they're in has been subscribed to, whether built by New Relic or others. Full users theoretically have Nerdpack management permissions, but there may be restrictions related to custom role assignments (see below). Role-related restrictions For full users, there are role-related rules that may impact one's ability to manage Nerdpacks (publish them and subscribe to them). How this works depends on your account/user model: Original user model: Owners and Admins can manage Nerdpacks, as can users specifically assigned the Nerdpack manager add-on role. For more details about how account access works for users, see Account access New Relic One user model: the ability to manage Nerdpacks is dependent on the \"modify Nerdpacks\" capability. That capability is included in the All product admin role, which both the default Admin and User groups have. And it can also be assigned to a custom role. To learn more about account/user models, see User model overview. Account access For organizations with master/sub-account structures: If you subscribe to a Nerdpack from a master account, that access is inherited by all of its sub-accounts. A Nerdpack made by your team can only be subscribed to from the master account that was used to publish it, or from its sub-accounts. This means that, if the Nerdpack needs to be available across your organization, you may need a New Relic admin to deploy it.",

      "body": "There are several restrictions around who can publish, use, and subscribe to Nerdpacks (the file packages that represent New Relic One applications). Restrictions for basic users The most important permissions factor is user type. A basic user has several restrictions related to their inability to access Full Stack Observability, and a full user theoretically has full abilities. Basic users can build and serve their own Nerdpacks locally. They can also use public Nerdpacks that meet both of the following criteria: New Relic must have specifically allowed basic users to use the Nerdpack Someone else on the basic user's account must have already subscribed to the Nerdpack Nerdpacks that basic users can use are rare. Basic users can't: Publish the Nerdpacks they build Tag their Nerdpacks Subscribe an account to a Nerdpack Use private Nerdpacks (including their own) Use public Nerdpacks that New Relic hasn't specifically allowed them to use Full users can use any Nerdpacks that the account they're in has been subscribed to, whether built by New Relic or others. Full users theoretically have Nerdpack management permissions, but there may be restrictions related to custom role assignments (see below). Role-related restrictions For full users, there are role-related rules that may impact one's ability to manage Nerdpacks (publish them and subscribe to them). How this works depends on your account/user model: Original user model: Owners and Admins can manage Nerdpacks, as can users specifically assigned the Nerdpack manager add-on role. For more details about how account access works for users, see Account access New Relic One user model: the ability to manage Nerdpacks is dependent on the \"modify Nerdpacks\" capability. That capability is included in the All product admin role, which both the default Admin and User groups have. And it can also be assigned to a custom role. To learn more about account/user models, see User model overview. Account access For organizations with master/sub-account structures: If you subscribe to a Nerdpack from a master account, that access is inherited by all of its sub-accounts. A Nerdpack made by your team can only be subscribed to from the master account that was used to publish it, or from its sub-accounts. This means that, if the Nerdpack needs to be available across your organization, you may need a New Relic admin to deploy it.",

Update your Nerdpack's catalog metadata After you've published your Nerdpack to the New Relic One catalog, update the Nerdpack's metadata to let users know all about your Nerdlets or visualizations. Step 1 of 9 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 9 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 9 Find your published Nerdpack under New Relic One catalog: Notice that there is no information on the Apps or details page other than the Nerdpack's name and the brief description found in nr1.json: There are no screenshots, icons, details, or what's new features. To add these, your Nerdpack needs a catalog directory. Step 4 of 9 From the root of your Nerdpack, create a catalog directory to house your Nerdpack's screenshots and metadata: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog ✔ Component created successfully! catalog is available at \"./catalog\" Inside your catalog directory, you'll find specific files and directories for portraying information about your Nerdpack to your users: bash Copy $ ls catalog README.md additionalInfo.md config.json documentation.md screenshots File Description README.md A markdown file that instructs you how to use the information and metadata in catalog config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application.

Step 1 of 7 Update the icon.png in the root of your Nerdpack. This icon is used in the catalog and the Nerdpack's detail page. Step 2 of 7 If you're building a Nerdpack with one or more launchers, update the icon.png in each of your launcher's subfolders.

Check your permissions To tag a Nerdpack version, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can tag them. Tag a version After you've published a Nerdpack version to the New Relic One catalog, you can tag it with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 2 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. Here, you tagged version 1.0.0 as DEV. Now, you, and other users on your account, can use this tag: You see the tag as an option to subscribe to when you add the Nerdpack to your account If you subscribe to the DEV tag and it gets updated later—say, DEV is applied to version 1.0.1—you automatically get upgraded to the new version without having to subscribe again. Important One of the features of tagging release versions is that users who are subscribed to a tag automatically get updates when that tag is used for another version. This means that if a user is testing one version, say 1.0.0, and you apply that same tag to another version, say 1.0.1, that user will see version 1.0.1 in their account, and they can no longer access the Nerdpack they were testing before. Often times, this is the expected behavior, but make sure you consider this side effect when you use tags. Step 2 of 2 View your Nerdpack's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 5 hours ago DEV This output confirms your DEV tag on version 1.0.0. Untag a version As you build more versions of your Nerdpack, you may update your tags to newer versions. However, you can also remove a tag from your Nerdpack with nr1. Step 1 of 3 From your Nerdpack's root directory, view your registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ---- 2.0.0 a few seconds ago DEV 1.0.1 8 minutes ago BETA, STABLE 1.0.0 6 hours ago Here, you see that version 1.0.0 has no tags, version 1.0.1 has two tags, BETA and STABLE, and version 2.0.0 has one tag, DEV. Step 2 of 3 Remove the BETA tag from your Nerdpack versions: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:untag --tag=BETA ✔ Removed nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 tag BETA. Step 3 of 3 Verify that the tag was removed from your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- -------------- ---- 2.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV 1.0.1 13 minutes ago STABLE 1.0.0 6 hours ago Resolve issues with tagging a Nerdpack version Sometimes, when you tag to a Nerdpack version, you may come across issues. Whether you can't tag your Nerdpack or you can't untag your Nerdpack, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Publish your Nerdpack If you try to tag your Nerdpack without first publishing it, you'll get an error: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV › Error: A downstream error occurred. This error message doesn't say much, but you can use the --verbose option to see more information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV --verbose init version: @oclif/command@1.8.0 argv: [ '--tag=DEV', '--verbose', [length]: 2 ] dist/metadata.json does not exist. package.json will be used instead. Using profile account-1234567 Request: POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Data: mutation nerdpackTagVersion( nerdpackId: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", versionTag: tag: \"DEV\", version: \"1.0.0\" } ) nerdpackId tags version } } Headers: 'API-Key': '<YOU USER KEY>', 'Content-Type': 'application/graphql' } This more verbose error message shows the GraphQL that runs behind the scenes for nr1 nerdpack:tag. The important part of the message here is: bash Copy dist/metadata.json does not exist. package.json will be used instead. The dist directory is created when you publish your app. So, because it hasn't been published yet, this directory doesn't exist and nr1 falls back to package.json to look for details about your Nerdpack. But, because the UUID in your package.json isn't in the New Relic registry, the command failed. So, before you tag your versions, publish them to the registry: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV Tip Remember that you can also tag a version at the same time you deploy it! bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag=DEV Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack You can only remove tags that have no subscribers. If you try to remove a tag that users are subscribed to, you'll get an error: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 2.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 3 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 2.0.0 an hour ago DEV 1.0.1 an hour ago 1.0.0 6 hours ago $ nr1 nerdpack:untag -t DEV › Error: A downstream error occurred. In this case, check to see if you're subscribed to the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ----------------- ----------- ---------- 2.0.0 ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 MyAwesomeNerdpack an hour ago 1000383529 This shows that you're subscribed to MyAwesomeNerdpack. Unsubscribe, then try to remove the DEV tag again: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. $ nr1 nerdpack:untag --tag=DEV ✔ Removed nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 tag DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 2.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 3 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 2.0.0 an hour ago 1.0.1 an hour ago 1.0.0 6 hours ago",

      "body": "When you create a dashboard, you add a variety of charts to visualize your New Relic telemetry data. These charts, offered out-of-the-box, are customizable in that you can: Resize and arrange their positions in your dashboard Update their names, display options, and underlying data queries But sometimes the charts we include in the platform aren't enough for you to get the most from your data. When you want to visualize your data in a specific way that isn't possible with our charts, you can build a custom visualization. New Relic is programmable. This means that if the platform doesn't solve your specific problem, you can write and deploy your own code to fill in some of those gaps. One area where programmability is valuable is in visualizing your data. While New Relic offers all the telemetry data that your apps and services report and provides many different kinds of charts to present that data, you might need to create something entirely unique. With the New Relic One SDK, we've provided you all the tools you'll need to create your own visualizations. Build your custom visualization With the New Relic One SDK, you can create a Nerdpack, which houses your visualization code. This code consists of a React component, logic, data queries, and external dependencies. The SDK also provides a component library that you can use to make NerdGraph requests, access platform state context, and more. Your first visualization To build your first custom visualization, install the New Relic One SDK and make sure you have the latest version: bash Copy $ nr1 update Create a Nerdpack and a visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name custom-viz ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ...my-first-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-first-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization custom-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz/visualizations/custom-viz\" The visualization you created in the my-first-viz Nerdpack contains a default component to help you get started. Serve your visualization locally: bash Copy $ cd my-first-viz $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ custom-viz https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Important To view the locally served visualization, you must use the nerdpacks=local querystring. Enter values into the fields under Configure visualization properties and see how the chart changes: Resources Here is a list of resources for building custom visualizations: Build a custom visualization for dashboards (Guide) Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK (Guide) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Customize your visualization You have a lot of control over how your visualization operates. You can choose what properties of the visualization are customizable, such as colors, sizes, and how you present your legend. You can choose whether it presents New Relic data or data from an external source. You can even install and use third-party components to create a specific look: Resources Here is a list of resources for configuring custom visualizations: Configuration options (Documentation) Customize visualizations with configuration (Guide) Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (Video) Use your custom visualization During development, you can serve your visualization locally. Under Apps > Custom Visualizations, you can view and configure your visualization to see how your data looks, but you can't instantiate that chart and use it in your account: To do that, you need to publish it to the New Relic One catalog and subscribe to it from your account. Because custom visualizations are Nerdpack artifacts, you publish and subscribe to them the same way you publish and subscribe to New Relic One applications. Once you've done so, you can add your custom visualization to a dashboard: If you want to reuse your visualization to present different data or the same data in a new way, you can go back to Apps > Custom Visualizations, choose your visualization, configure another instance and add it to your dashboard: Resources Here is a list of resources for using custom visualizations: Add custom visualizations to your dashboards (Documentation) New Relic Dashboards and Custom Visualizations: Flexibility with Less Toil (Blog) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (Video)",

When you build a New Relic One application, it's valuable to view it on the platform. This helps you design, implement, and debug your application in the environment it will eventually be published to. With nr1, you can launch a development server that hosts your application so that New Relic One can present it to you. Step 1 of 4 From inside the Nerdpack's root directory, serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve When the Nerdpack has succeeded building and your application is ready to view, you'll see a message with a link to New Relic One: bash Copy ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! Notice the appended query parameter nerdpacks=local.

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] }, \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Use New Relic's metrics API service to define rules for creating metrics from your other types of data, such as events, logs, or spans. Recommendation: Before you begin, review our requirements and tips for creating rules. Create a metrics rule To create a rule for creating metrics from events, logs, or spans: Construct the metrics rule using NRQL. Construct a NerdGraph (GraphQL format) API request that contains your NRQL rule. Create the metric by making the API request. Once a metric is created, you can query and chart it using NRQL. Step 1. Create NRQL query rule The most important part of creating a metrics rule is constructing the NRQL query that defines the metric for your data from events, logs, or spans. You can create up to 10 metrics with a single NRQL query by following this procedure: Using New Relic's NRQL interface, construct a query for the metric you want to create. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT average(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy Edit the query to use one of the three available metric types: summary: Use if the query's function is min, max, sum, count, or average. uniqueCount: Use if the query's function is uniqueCount. distribution: Use if the query's function is percentile or histogram. This example query uses average, so use summary: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary (ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' Copy This example query uses count on a non-numeric field: FROM ProcessSample SELECT count(hostname) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy For summary on a non-numeric field use summary(1): FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(1) WHERE hostname LIKE '%prod%' Copy Tip For more detailed information on using these metric types in rules, see Creating metric rules: requirements and tips. Decide on the attributes you want to attach to the metric, following the limits on the cardinality of unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations. Recommendation: Run a separate query to ensure this count isn't over 50,000 for a 24-hour window. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT uniqueCount(awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy To be able to aggregate and filter your metrics, add the attributes you want to attach to the metric using the FACET clause. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Set the name of the metric using the AS function. For example: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'HOST' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy Once your NRQL rule is complete, use it to create the API request. Step 2. Create API request After you build the NRQL rule to convert data from events, logs, or spans to metrics, continue with building the API request. You can use our NerdGraph API tool to explore the data structure and to construct and make your request. To check that the rule was created correctly, you can run a query to return that rule using its ID. For tips on querying the metrics you've created, see Query and chart your metrics. Example NerdGraph API request The following example NerdGraph API request uses the same NRQL rule from step 1. The IO Total Read Bytes Rule creates a metric named io.totalread.bytes. (The rule name can have spaces, which differs from the metric naming rules.) mutation { eventsToMetricsCreateRule(rules: { name: \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", description:\"Created by Zach on March 27, 2019. Used by team Network.\", nrql:\"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\", accountId: 123456 }) { successes { id name nrql enabled } failures { submitted { name nrql accountId } errors { reason description } } } } Copy In this request: Request elements Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsCreateRule The method being called to create a rule. rules Takes four parameters: name: The name of the rule. description: Optional. The description of the rule. We recommend you include information about who created the metric data and who will be using the data. accountId: The New Relic account ID where the events, logs, or spans live and the metrics will be created. nrql: The NRQL query that creates the rule. For more on this, see Create NRQL query. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a successful or failed response. Available parameters for these blocks include: id (ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled (enabled/disabled status) accountId ruleId and accountId If a failure occurs, then the submitted ruleId and accountId will be returned along with the error reason and error description. Example NerdGraph API response Here's an example of a returned response: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsCreateRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"46\", \"name\": \"io.totalread.bytes for computeSample entities\", \"nrql\": \"FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE nr.entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName\" } ] } } } Copy Step 3. Create a metrics rule with API request When your API request is ready, you can use the NerdGraph API to make the request, which will create the metrics. Query and chart your metrics After you create a metrics rule to convert data for your events, logs, or spans, you can view the new metric data in the New Relic UI. To view your data: Go to New Relic's NRQL query interface. Run the following query to see the name of all your metrics: SELECT uniques(metricName) FROM Metric Copy Pick the metric of interest, then run the following query to see the available attributes: SELECT * FROM Metric where metricName = 'yourMetric' Copy If you don't see expected data, follow the troubleshooting procedures. The available NRQL aggregator functions depend on the metric type you created. Here are some examples. Summary metric example If you created a summary metric type, you can use the count, sum, max, min, and average aggregator functions, as shown in the following query: SELECT count(appStartResponseTime), sum(appStartResponseTime), max(appStartResponseTime), min(appStartResponseTime), average(appStartResponseTime) FROM Metric Copy Count metric example If you created a uniqueCount metric type, you can only use the uniqueCount function, as shown in the following query: SELECT uniqueCount(playbackErrorStreamUniqueCount) * 100 / uniqueCount(streamUniqueCount) AS '% of Streams Impacted' FROM Metric Copy Distribution metric example If you created a distribution metric type, use the percentile or histogram functions, as shown in the following queries: SELECT percentile(service.responseTime, 95) FROM Metric Copy OR SELECT histogram(service.responseTime, 10, 20) FROM Metric Copy Troubleshooting If your NerdGraph call is not constructed correctly, you may receive a message like this: Cannot parse the unexpected character \"\\u201C” Copy Verify the quotes in the NerdGraph call are not smart quotes (curly quotes). Our NerdGraph API only accepts straight quotes.",

      "body": "There are several restrictions around who can publish, use, and subscribe to Nerdpacks (the file packages that represent New Relic One applications). Restrictions for basic users The most important permissions factor is user type. A basic user has several restrictions related to their inability to access Full Stack Observability, and a full user theoretically has full abilities. Basic users can build and serve their own Nerdpacks locally. They can also use public Nerdpacks that meet both of the following criteria: New Relic must have specifically allowed basic users to use the Nerdpack Someone else on the basic user's account must have already subscribed to the Nerdpack Nerdpacks that basic users can use are rare. Basic users can't: Publish the Nerdpacks they build Tag their Nerdpacks Subscribe an account to a Nerdpack Use private Nerdpacks (including their own) Use public Nerdpacks that New Relic hasn't specifically allowed them to use Full users can use any Nerdpacks that the account they're in has been subscribed to, whether built by New Relic or others. Full users theoretically have Nerdpack management permissions, but there may be restrictions related to custom role assignments (see below). Role-related restrictions For full users, there are role-related rules that may impact one's ability to manage Nerdpacks (publish them and subscribe to them). How this works depends on your account/user model: Original user model: Owners and Admins can manage Nerdpacks, as can users specifically assigned the Nerdpack manager add-on role. For more details about how account access works for users, see Account access New Relic One user model: the ability to manage Nerdpacks is dependent on the \"modify Nerdpacks\" capability. That capability is included in the All product admin role, which both the default Admin and User groups have. And it can also be assigned to a custom role. To learn more about account/user models, see User model overview. Account access For organizations with master/sub-account structures: If you subscribe to a Nerdpack from a master account, that access is inherited by all of its sub-accounts. A Nerdpack made by your team can only be subscribed to from the master account that was used to publish it, or from its sub-accounts. This means that, if the Nerdpack needs to be available across your organization, you may need a New Relic admin to deploy it.",

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "When you create a dashboard, you add a variety of charts to visualize your New Relic telemetry data. These charts, offered out-of-the-box, are customizable in that you can: Resize and arrange their positions in your dashboard Update their names, display options, and underlying data queries But sometimes the charts we include in the platform aren't enough for you to get the most from your data. When you want to visualize your data in a specific way that isn't possible with our charts, you can build a custom visualization. New Relic is programmable. This means that if the platform doesn't solve your specific problem, you can write and deploy your own code to fill in some of those gaps. One area where programmability is valuable is in visualizing your data. While New Relic offers all the telemetry data that your apps and services report and provides many different kinds of charts to present that data, you might need to create something entirely unique. With the New Relic One SDK, we've provided you all the tools you'll need to create your own visualizations. Build your custom visualization With the New Relic One SDK, you can create a Nerdpack, which houses your visualization code. This code consists of a React component, logic, data queries, and external dependencies. The SDK also provides a component library that you can use to make NerdGraph requests, access platform state context, and more. Your first visualization To build your first custom visualization, install the New Relic One SDK and make sure you have the latest version: bash Copy $ nr1 update Create a Nerdpack and a visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name custom-viz ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ...my-first-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-first-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization custom-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz/visualizations/custom-viz\" The visualization you created in the my-first-viz Nerdpack contains a default component to help you get started. Serve your visualization locally: bash Copy $ cd my-first-viz $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ custom-viz https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Important To view the locally served visualization, you must use the nerdpacks=local querystring. Enter values into the fields under Configure visualization properties and see how the chart changes: Resources Here is a list of resources for building custom visualizations: Build a custom visualization for dashboards (Guide) Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK (Guide) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Customize your visualization You have a lot of control over how your visualization operates. You can choose what properties of the visualization are customizable, such as colors, sizes, and how you present your legend. You can choose whether it presents New Relic data or data from an external source. You can even install and use third-party components to create a specific look: Resources Here is a list of resources for configuring custom visualizations: Configuration options (Documentation) Customize visualizations with configuration (Guide) Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (Video) Use your custom visualization During development, you can serve your visualization locally. Under Apps > Custom Visualizations, you can view and configure your visualization to see how your data looks, but you can't instantiate that chart and use it in your account: To do that, you need to publish it to the New Relic One catalog and subscribe to it from your account. Because custom visualizations are Nerdpack artifacts, you publish and subscribe to them the same way you publish and subscribe to New Relic One applications. Once you've done so, you can add your custom visualization to a dashboard: If you want to reuse your visualization to present different data or the same data in a new way, you can go back to Apps > Custom Visualizations, choose your visualization, configure another instance and add it to your dashboard: Resources Here is a list of resources for using custom visualizations: Add custom visualizations to your dashboards (Documentation) New Relic Dashboards and Custom Visualizations: Flexibility with Less Toil (Blog) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (Video)",

Check your permissions To tag a Nerdpack version, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can tag them. Tag a version After you've published a Nerdpack version to the New Relic One catalog, you can tag it with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 2 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. Here, you tagged version 1.0.0 as DEV. Now, you, and other users on your account, can use this tag: You see the tag as an option to subscribe to when you add the Nerdpack to your account If you subscribe to the DEV tag and it gets updated later—say, DEV is applied to version 1.0.1—you automatically get upgraded to the new version without having to subscribe again. Important One of the features of tagging release versions is that users who are subscribed to a tag automatically get updates when that tag is used for another version. This means that if a user is testing one version, say 1.0.0, and you apply that same tag to another version, say 1.0.1, that user will see version 1.0.1 in their account, and they can no longer access the Nerdpack they were testing before. Often times, this is the expected behavior, but make sure you consider this side effect when you use tags. Step 2 of 2 View your Nerdpack's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 5 hours ago DEV This output confirms your DEV tag on version 1.0.0. Untag a version As you build more versions of your Nerdpack, you may update your tags to newer versions. However, you can also remove a tag from your Nerdpack with nr1. Step 1 of 3 From your Nerdpack's root directory, view your registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ---- 2.0.0 a few seconds ago DEV 1.0.1 8 minutes ago BETA, STABLE 1.0.0 6 hours ago Here, you see that version 1.0.0 has no tags, version 1.0.1 has two tags, BETA and STABLE, and version 2.0.0 has one tag, DEV. Step 2 of 3 Remove the BETA tag from your Nerdpack versions: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:untag --tag=BETA ✔ Removed nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 tag BETA. Step 3 of 3 Verify that the tag was removed from your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- -------------- ---- 2.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV 1.0.1 13 minutes ago STABLE 1.0.0 6 hours ago Resolve issues with tagging a Nerdpack version Sometimes, when you tag to a Nerdpack version, you may come across issues. Whether you can't tag your Nerdpack or you can't untag your Nerdpack, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Publish your Nerdpack If you try to tag your Nerdpack without first publishing it, you'll get an error: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV › Error: A downstream error occurred. This error message doesn't say much, but you can use the --verbose option to see more information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV --verbose init version: @oclif/command@1.8.0 argv: [ '--tag=DEV', '--verbose', [length]: 2 ] dist/metadata.json does not exist. package.json will be used instead.

The important part of the message here is: bash Copy dist/metadata.json does not exist. package.json will be used instead. The dist directory is created when you publish your app. So, because it hasn't been published yet, this directory doesn't exist and nr1 falls back to package.json to look for details about your Nerdpack. But, because the UUID in your package.json isn't in the New Relic registry, the command failed. So, before you tag your versions, publish them to the registry: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV Tip Remember that you can also tag a version at the same time you deploy it! bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag=DEV Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack You can only remove tags that have no subscribers. If you try to remove a tag that users are subscribed to, you'll get an error: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 2.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 3 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 2.0.0 an hour ago DEV 1.0.1 an hour ago 1.0.0 6 hours ago $ nr1 nerdpack:untag -t DEV › Error: A downstream error occurred.

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have accounts in GitHub and New Relic. To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in the New Relic One Catalog, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "Publish your Nerdpack, whether it's still in development, ready for testing, or stable, to share it with others. Check your permissions When you publish your Nerdpack, it's registered with the New Relic One catalog. From there, some users can subscribe to your Nerdpack. Subscribing users need to have: Access to the account that published the Nerdpack The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Update your package version You can only publish a package version to the catalog one time. For example, you can't publish two instances of version 1.0.0. So, each time you want to deploy a new version of your code, you need to increment its version in the Nerdpack's package.json file: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy Tip Nerdpack versions follow semantic versioning. Read the documentation to learn more. Generate a UUID for your Nerdpack If you built your Nerdpack from scratch with nr1 create --type nerdpack, then your Nerdpack has a unique identifier. Find this identifier in the root directory's nr1.json file: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"DemoApp\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack demo-app\" } nr1.json Copy This ID must be unique to your Nerdpack when you publish it to the catalog. The platform will reject your Nerdpack if it recognizes the ID. So, if you cloned an existing Nerdpack or are otherwise using open source code, generate a new UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --generate --force Tip Read the nr1 nerdpack:uuid documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --help Publish your Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish If you've successfully published your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This output describes the published Nerdpack. First, it states the Nerdpack's ID (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890). Then, its version (1.0.0). Finally, its version tag (STABLE). You already managed your Nerdpack's ID and version, but the version tag is new. To manage your Nerdpack's versions, you can tag them with an arbitrary tag. For example, if a version is still in development, you can tag it with a DEV tag. If the version moves to a QA phase, you can tag it with QA. If it's ready for production, you can tag it with STABLE. Tip Read our tag guide to learn more. Use the -t or --tag option to publish your Nerdpack with a tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag DEV As you saw in the nr1 nerdpack:publish output, if you don't pass a tag, nr1 applies the STABLE tag automatically. However, you can tell it to not apply any tags to a release with the -T or --skip-tag option: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --skip-tag You can also perform a dry run to make sure you publish your Nerdpack the way you want to: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --dry-run Step 2 of 4 Once you've successfully published your Nerdpack, go to New Relic: Because you're going to view a published Nerdpack, rather than a locally served one, you don't need to pass the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to Apps: Whether you published a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Apps. Step 4 of 4 Find your published Nerdpack under New Relic One catalog: Notice the Custom indicator on its UI tile. Use this to distinguish between published Nerdpacks and locally-served Nerdpacks. Tip Only Nerdpacks with tagged versions are shown under New Relic One catalog. So, if you published without a tag or removed a tag from your published Nerdpack, you won't see it in the catalog. Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you publish your Nerdpack, you may come across issues. Whether you can't publish your Nerdpack due to some issue with your code or you can't find your Nerdpack in the catalog, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your command When you attempt to publish your Nerdpack, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. For example: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack DemoApp (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890) › Error: There is already a Nerdpack with given id & version. › Code: 409 It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --verbose Reveal your published Nerdpack information If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, it may not be tagged. Remember, at least one version of your published Nerdpack must have a tag for it to show on the Apps page. See more information about your published Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:info: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 3014918 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 3 hours ago In this example, there is one published version, but it isn't tagged. You can tag a published version with: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --from-version=1.0.0 --tag=DEV Now, if you refresh your browser page, you should see your Nerdpack on Apps. Tip Read our nr1 nerdpack:tag documentation to learn more. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you publish your Nerdpack, only users who can access your account can see your published Nerdpack. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic but you know it's published, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same.",

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "Subscribe to a Nerdpack to use it in the New Relic platform. Unsubscribe from Nerdpacks you no longer use. Check your permissions To subscribe to a Nerdpack, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can subscribe to them: Publish your Nerdpack Tag your Nerdpack if it's published and doesn't yet have a tag Subscribe to a Nerdpack Subscribe to a published Nerdpack, with either the web UI or the nr1 CLI, to use it in your account. Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack under New Relic One catalog: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the New Relic One catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel. Tip nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:unset. Read the nr1 subscription:unset documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:unset --help Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you subscribe to a Nerdpack, you may run into issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",
