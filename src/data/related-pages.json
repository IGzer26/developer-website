      "body": "Mobile monitoring has an HTTP requests UI page that helps you better understand HTTP requests associated with your mobile app and how those network calls are affecting performance. This document describes the Enterprise-level HTTP requests page. Non-Enterprise accounts will see the legacy HTTP requests page. Find and use HTTP requests page To view mobile monitoring's HTTP requests page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > HTTP requests. Use our standard page functions to look for trends in the HTTP analysis charts. Target specific request and response attributes by grouping, sorting, and filtering the data. Understand HTTP request data Here are some places to find the most important HTTP request information: Response time chart The response time chart shows how your app's network calls are performing across percentiles. Use it to compare the average response time to the 1st, 50th, and 99th percentile. Percentiles let you filter out outliers that may be making your average response time higher than expected. HTTP errors and network failures chart This chart shows the unsuccessful network calls your app is experiencing. Select the chart title to go to the HTTP errors page for more detail on the errors and failures. Total requests Sort by Total requests to identify which network requests are being used most frequently. The reason this can be helpful is because your slowest network calls may be only infrequently used, while more frequently used requests might be more worthy of optimization even if they are not the slowest. For a description of the non-Enterprise HTTP requests UI page, see Legacy HTTP requests. Group, sort, and filter HTTP requests If you want to... Do this... Group and sort HTTP requests in different ways Make selections from the Group by and Sort by dropdowns. By default, the HTTP requests page is grouped by request domain and sorted by average response time. Filter for specific HTTP requests Select an HTTP request from the Errors and failures list and/or select multiple filters from the Filter dropdown. See or remove applied filters The filters you select are displayed next to the filter dropdown. To clear filters, select the X icon on the filter you want to clear.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Fetch data from a third-party service, before starting this one. In this course, you're building a New Relic One application. This application shows telemetry data from a demo service that is running an A/B test so that it can reveal that data in charts, like a dashboard. Your New Relic application is different than a dashboard, however, because it does more than show New Relic data. It pulls external data, provides UI components and functionality, and even has its own small data stores. The purpose of this New Relic application is to present context so you can better understand the A/B test results and how those results tie in to your business objectives. So far, you've built all your charts, organized them for improved usability, provided them with real data, and more. There are some final improvements you can make, using Platform API components. In this lesson, you learn how to use values in the New Relic platform state. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-platform-state-context/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, add a PlatformStateContext.Consumer to your NewsletterSignups component's render() method: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Notice that NrqlQuery uses a constant called ACCOUNT_ID. Instead of hardcoding an account identifier in your Nerdlet, you can use accountId from the platform URL state. Step 3 of 10 PlatformStateContext.Consumer provides access to the platform's URL state. This context contains an important value you'll use in your app, called timeRange. Notice that your NrqlQuery uses a SINCE clause that identifies the historical timeframe your query should fetch data from. Right now, that SINCE clause is set to 30 MINUTES AGO. With timeRange, you can use the platform's time picker to make this timeframe adjustable. Step 4 of 10 Utilize the platform state's timeRange: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, NewsletterSignups uses platformState.timeRange instead of a hardcoded SINCE clause. While NrqlQuery components accept a convenient timeRange prop, not every component does. You can still use timeRange in other contexts by accessing duration, begin_time, or end_time: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { console.log(platformState.timeRange.duration); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>; Copy Step 5 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test. Step 6 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 7 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 10 View your application: Your NrqlQuery now uses the platform state's timeRange, but your chart probably still shows the last 30 minutes. Why? Where does the timeRange in platform state come from? The time picker sits on the right side of your application's navigation bar: Change this value and see your chart update: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 9 of 10 Update VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Of all the charts in your New Relic One application, these three charts are the ones that should update with the time picker. The others, Total subscriptions per version, Total cancellations per version, Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions, Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, show total values over time. So, hardcoding their SINCE clauses to 7 DAYS AGO makes sense, as this is a reasonable time period for the purposes of this course. Step 10 of 10 While still serving your Nerdpack locally, view your NR1 app to see your charts updating with the time range you choose: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now that you're basing your queries off the platform state, some of your charts are dynamic in their time ranges. This is a great improvement because it allows you to adjust your charts to show data from any particular point in time, which is useful for tying data to business outcomes. The Platform API components offer a lot more functionality, too, including the ability to navigate the user to another place in New Relic. You'll learn how to do this in the next lesson. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Add navigation to your nerdlet.",

      "body": "Access the New Relic platform from the comfort of your terminal. You can use the New Relic CLI to manage entity tags, define workloads, record deployment markers, and much more. In short, you can use the CLI to automate common tasks in your DevOps workflow. This guide walks you through the essentials of New Relic CLI, from install and configuration to basic usage. Before you begin For this guide you just need: Your New Relic user key. An instrumented application in your New Relic account. Step 1 of 10 Install the New Relic CLI Download the New Relic CLI for your operating system, as described below. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Using Snapcraft, run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Using Homebrew, run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Using Scoop, run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 10 Create your New Relic CLI profile. After you install the New Relic CLI, it's time to create your first profile. Profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command, which is useful when switching between accounts. Run the profiles add command: bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add --profile tutorial --apiKey YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY -r YOUR_REGION $ # Set the profile as defaults $ newrelic profiles default --profile tutorial Important You must set the region of your New Relic account. Use -r to set either us or eu. Step 3 of 10 Get your application details. Now, add tags to the application you've instrumented with New Relic. Tags are key-value pairs that can help you organize and filter your entities. An entity (for example, an application) can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. Before searching for your application using the New Relic CLI, write down or copy your Account ID and the name of your application in New Relic - you need both to find applications in the New Relic platform. Step 4 of 10 Retrieve your application details as a JSON object. To search for your APM application, use the apm application search command: bash Copy $ newrelic apm application search --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID --name NAME_OF_YOUR_APP Tip If you get an error, check that your account ID and application name are correct. Step 5 of 10 Find the guid value. If the account ID is valid, and the application name exists in your account, apm application search yields data similar to this example: [ { \"accountId\": YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, \"applicationId\": YOUR_APP_ID, \"domain\": \"APM\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"A_LONG_GUID\", \"name\": \"NAME_OF_YOUR_APP\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/A_LONG_GUID\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" } ] Copy When you've successfully searched for your application, look for the guid value. It's a unique identifier for your application. You should copy it or write it down. Step 6 of 10 Add a simple tag to your application. Now that you have the GUID, you can point the New Relic CLI directly at your application. Adding a tag is the simplest way to try out the CLI capabilities (don't worry, tags can be deleted by using entity tags delete). Here, you add an environment tag to your application. Add the dev:testing tag⁠ (or any other key-value pair) to your application using the entities tags create command: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag devkit:testing Step 7 of 10 Add tag sets. What if you want to add multiple tags? Tag sets to the rescue! While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 To add multiple tags to your application at once, modify and run this snippet: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: this means it could take a while for the tags to get created. Step 8 of 10 Retrieve your application's tags. You've created and added some tags to your application, but to test that they're working, you need to retrieve them. Run the entity tags get command: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags get --guid YOUR_APP_GUID All tags associated with your application are retrieved as a JSON array: [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Step 9 of 10 Bonus step: create a deployment marker. Deployments of applications often go wrong. Deployment markers are labels that, when attached to your application data, help you track deployments and troubleshoot what happened. To create a deployment marker, run the apm deployment create command using the same application ID from your earlier search: bash Copy $ newrelic apm deployment create --applicationId YOUR_APP_ID --revision $(git describe --tags --always) Step 10 of 10 Check the JSON response for the revision and timestamp of the deployment. You can build this workflow into a continuous integration or continuous deployment (CI/CD) system to indicate changes in your application's behavior after deployments. Here's an example: { \"id\": 37075986, \"links\": { \"application\": 204261368 }, \"revision\": \"v1.2.4\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-03-04T15:11:44-08:00\", \"user\": \"Developer Toolkit Test Account\" } Copy Next steps Have a look at all the available commands in the New Relic CLI. For example, you can create a New Relic workflow using workload create If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All CloudWatch metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay, and therefore not included in the stream. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. This template is provided as a base to setup the integration on a single region, and can be customized and extended based on your requirements. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: New Relic Ensure the following settings are defined: New Relic configuration (Destination Settings) HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum('aws.s3.5xxErrors') FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from most services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Note that not all metrics have their custom tags as dimensions. Currently, only metrics linked to entities in the New Relic Explorer have their custom tags associated. The AWS CloudWatch metric stream doesn't include tags as part of the stream message, hence, additional processing is required on the New Relic side. Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for different AWS Services is available in the New Relic One Quickstarts app. Get access to the Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Navigate to the Apps catalog in New Relic One. Search and select the Quickstarts app. Click on the Add this app link in the top-right corner. To enable the app, select target accounts and confirm clicking the Update account button. If applicable, review and confirm the Terms and Conditions of Use. Note that it might take a few minutes until permissions are applied and the app is ready to be used. Once available, confirm the app is enabled. The Quickstarts app will be listed in the Apps catalog. Import dashboards from Quickstarts App Follow these steps in order to import any of the curated dashboards: Navigate to Apps and open the Quickstarts app. Browse the AWS Dashboards. If you don't find a dashboard for your AWS service please submit your feedback on the top navigation bar or feel free to contribute with your own dashboard. Select the dashboard, confirm the target account and initial dashboard name. A copy of the dashboard should be imported in the target account. Additional customization is possible using any of the New Relic One dashboarding features. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in the CloudWatch Metric Stream in order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from AWS API polling integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Migration steps On a typical deployment, migrating from API polling to metric stream involves the following steps (we recommend trying this on a dev / staging environment first): Go through the AWS UI in New Relic (or use NerdGraph APIs) to link your AWS account with New Relic. This is currently needed even if your AWS account is already linked with polling integrations. Make sure you complete the last step in the onboarding, which involves enabling AWS CloudWatch metric stream and the AWS Kinesis Data Firehose to push metrics to New Relic. Complete this step for any additional AWS region you want to monitor, since AWS CloudWatch requires one stream per region. Ensure metrics are received from all connected regions and namespaces. This may take several minutes. Disable all unnecessary polling integrations in the previous AWS provider account. The following integrations still need to be enabled since they aren't fully replaced by metric streams: AWS Billing, AWS CloudTrail, AWS Health, AWS Trusted Advisor. Query, dashboard, alert and inventory considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Dashboards: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events will still work as expected. Alerts: Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events will still work. We recommend adapting those to the dimensional metric format (using NRQL as source). Entities: New Relic Explorer might show duplicated entities for up to 24 hours. Inventory: the Inventory page is not supported with AWS CloudWatch metric streams (inventory telemetry is not included in the stream). Integrations not fully replaced by metric streams The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects CloudWatch metrics, resource metadata and custom tags. The following API polling integrations still need to be enabled to get complete visibility from AWS: AWS Billing AWS CloudTrail AWS Health AWS Trusted Advisor AWS VPC Infrastructure Agent metrics and EC2 metadata decoration As with the EC2 API polling integration, when the infrastructure agent is installed on a host and the EC2 namespace is active via AWS CloudWatch metric stream integration, then all the infrastructure agent events and metrics are decorated with additional metadata. The following attributes will decorate infrastructure samples (some might not be applicable on all environments): awsAvailabilityZone, ec2InstanceId, ec2PublicDnsName, ec2State, ec2EbsOptimized, ec2PublicIpAddress, ec2PrivateIpAddress, ec2VpcId, ec2AmiId, ec2PrivateDnsName, ec2KeyName, ec2SubnetId, ec2InstanceType, ec2Hypervisor, ec2Architecture, ec2RootDeviceType, ec2RootDeviceName, ec2VirtualizationType, ec2PlacementGroupName, ec2PlacementGroupTenancy.",

      "body": "The REST API endpoints allow you to create conditions for your policies. This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes five types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services NRQL Synthetic monitoring Plugins All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. aggregation_delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics). CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer value. The timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point is received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using the EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_window Streaming alerts gather data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable. The default is 1 minute. The maximum is 15 minutes. Data points are collected together based on their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Aggregation window field. close_violations_on_expiration When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the expiration_duration time. The default is false. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects that will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma-separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions evaluation_offset Deprecated in favor of aggregation_delay. The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is 3 minutes. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Offset evaluation by field. expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions expiration_duration How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection. external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions fill_option For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. none: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation. static: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. last_value: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Fill data gaps with field. fill_value This is the value used by the fill_option custom value. The default is 0. ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts plugin conditions For Plugin conditions this is the metric, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification. Alerts conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_app_metric apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_kt_metric apdex error_percentage error_count response_time throughput browser_metric end_user_apdex total_page_load page_rendering web_application network dom_processing request_queuing ajax_response_time page_views_with_js_errors page_view_throughput ajax_throughput user_defined browser_metric_baseline page_view_throughput average_response_time ajax_response_time ajax_application_time mobile_metric database images json, network view_loading network_error_percentage status_error_percentage user_defined Alerts external service conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_external_service apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_app_metric_baseline external_service_transaction_time error_count database_transaction_time throughput_web response_time_web non_web_transaction_time web_transaction_database_time non_web_transaction_database_time mobile_external_service response_time_average response_time_minimum response_time_maximum throughput network_failure_percentage http_status_error_percentage metric_description This is a title for the metric which is displayed in notifications. Make this descriptive and unique so the reader will understand the nature of plugin metric being used to trigger an alert. Used for: Plugin conditions monitor_id This is the GUID of the Synthetic monitoring to alert on. Used for: Synthetic monitoring conditions name This condition title will allow to you identify it in the UI. Follow the guidelines for making this descriptive but short. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions nrql[query] This is the NRQL query that alerts monitors as part of a NRQL condition. Used for: NRQL conditions nrql[since_value] This is the timeframe (in minutes) in which to evaluate the specified NRQL query. since_value must be between 1 and 20. Used for: NRQL conditions open_violation_on_expiration When true, this opens a loss of signal violation when no signal within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. plugin[guid] This is the GUID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions plugin[id] This is the ID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions runbook_url The runbook URL to display in notifications. This field is optional. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 2 minutes. Used with event flow and cadence aggregation methods. signal[aggregation_window] One of three data aggregation methods: event flow, event timer, and cadence. The default is Event flow. signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 1 minute. Used with Event timer aggregation method. signal[aggregation_window] The duration in which data is collected together before being evaluated. Default is 1 minute. terms[duration] This is the time (in minutes) for the condition to persist before triggering an event. It corresponds to the duration set when adding a threshold in the UI. Used for: Conditions terms[operator] This determines what comparison will be used between the value_function and the terms [ threshold] value to trigger an event. It corresponds to the operation selected when adding a threshold in the UI. It must be one of the following strings: above below equal Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[priority] This corresponds to the severity level selected when setting the threshold values for the condition in the UI. This must be one of the following strings: critical warning Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[threshold] This is the threshold that the value_function must be compared to using the terms [ operator] for an event to be triggered. It corresponds to the numeric value specified in the UI when adding the threshold values. This is a numeric value and must be 0 (zero) or greater. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[time_function] This corresponds to the settings made in the UI when adding the threshold values. The choices are: all (corresponding to for at least in the UI) any (corresponding to at least once in in the UI) Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions type This defines the type of metric that will be used for the alert. Allowable content for the metric field depends on the type value chosen. There are two product categories : Alerts conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of alerts condition. type Use apm_app_metric APM application metric will trigger an alert. apm_app_metric_baseline APM application metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). apm_kt_metric APM key transaction metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric Browser metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric_baseline Browser metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). mobile_metric Mobile metric will trigger an alert. Used for: Conditions Alerts external service conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of external service condition. type Use apm_external_service APM external metric will trigger an alert. mobile_external_service Mobile external metric will trigger an alert. Used for: External service conditions user_defined[metric] (optional) This is the name of a user defined custom metric to be used to determine if an event should be triggered. The user_defined [ value_function] associated with the metric is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions user_defined[value_function] (optional) This is the numeric value obtained from the custom metric specified by user_defined [ metric]. It is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. One of these value functions must be specified: average min max total sample_size Used for: Conditions value_function This is the value function used from the plugin metric. This may be one of the strings: min max average sample_size total percent Used for: Plugin conditions When used for a NRQL condition, the options are: single_value (condition is evaluated based on each query's returned value) sum (condition is evaluated based on the sum of each query's returned values over the specified duration) violation_time_limit_seconds Use to automatically close instance-based violations after the number of seconds specified. Must be one of these values: 3600 7200 14400 28800 43200 86400 Used for: Location conditions NRQL conditions violation_close_timer Use to automatically close instance-based violations, including JVM health metric violations, after the number of hours specified. Must be one of these values: 1 2 4 8 12 24 Used for: apm_app_metric (with condition_scope set to instance) apm_jvm_metric",

Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). If the name begins with anything other than an alphabetical character, enclose the name with backticks in your NRQL query. For example: FROM `0_hello` SELECT count(*) Copy Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in APM and dashboards. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

      "body": "New Relic offers several tools to help obtain the information needed to provide useful metrics about your Node.js application. These include: Reading the route names (if used) from the Express and Restify routers Using the API to name the current request, either with simple names or groups of controllers with actions Support rules that are stored in your agent's configuration that can mark requests to be renamed or ignored based on regular expressions matched against the request's raw URLs (also available as API calls) The number of names that New Relic tracks needs to be small enough so that the user experience is robust. It also needs to be large enough to provide the right amount of information (without overwhelming you with data) so that you can identify problem spots in your applications more easily. For more information, see the Node.js agent configuration documentation and the Node.js agent API documentation on Github. Request names The Node.js agent captures the HTTP method along with a potentially parameterized path (such as /user/:id) or a regular expression (such as /^/user/([-0-9a-f]+)$/). These pieces of information become part of the request name. If you have support for slow transaction traces and have enabled capture_params in your config file, the transaction trace will also have the request's parameters and their values attached to it. If you are dissatisfied with the request names that the Node.js agent uses, you can use API calls to create more descriptive names. Tip If grouping your requests under the generic name, then /* is sufficient, and you do not need to customize your configuration file or API calls. Requirements New Relic uses request names to group requests for many charts and tables. The value of these visualizations will drop as the number of different request names increases. For example, do not include potentially dynamic data like GUIDs, numerical IDs, or timestamps in the request names you create. If your request is slow enough to generate a transaction trace, that trace will contain the original URL. If you enable parameter capture, the parameters will also be attached to the trace. Tip Avoid having more than 50 different transaction names. For example, if you have more than a couple hundred different request names, rethink your naming strategy. Avoid metric grouping issues The request naming API helps New Relic avoid problems with trying to handle too many metrics, which sometimes is referred to as \"metric explosion.\" New Relic has several strategies to deal with these issues; the most severe is simply to add offending applications to your deny list. The main reason for you to be careful in using these request-naming tools is to prevent that from happening to your applications. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. Guidelines Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general. The first rules listed in your config file or added with the Node.js transaction naming API will be applied first and should be narrowly targeted. More general \"fall-through\" rules should be added toward the end of the list, because they will be evaluated in the order they were configured or added using the Node.js transaction naming API. URL pattern matching An online retailer has a URL pattern like this: /user/customers/all/prospects /user/customers/all/current /user/customers/all/returning /user/customers/John /user/customers/Jane Copy The retailer could create rules like this: // newrelic.js exports.config={ //other configuration rules:{ name:[ { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/prospects/\", name: \"/user/customers/all/prospects\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/all\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/:customer\" } ] } } Copy With these rules, the retailer would create three transaction names: /user/customers/:customer /user/customers/all /user/customers/all/prospects If the retailer reversed the order, the rules would catch all transactions in :customer, which would not be as useful. Load the request naming API Make sure that loading the New Relic module is the first thing your application does, as it needs to bootstrap itself before the rest of your application loads: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); Copy This returns the request naming API. You can safely require the module from multiple modules in your application, as it only initializes itself once. Request API calls Here is a summary of the Request API calls for New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.setTransactionName(name) newrelic.setTransactionName(name) Copy Name the current request, following the request naming requirements. You can call this function anywhere within the context of an HTTP request handler, at any time after handling of the request has started, but before the request has finished. In general, if the request and response objects are in scope, you can set the name. Explicitly calling newrelic.setTransactionName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. newrelic.setControllerName(name, [action]) newrelic.setControllerName(name, [action]) Copy Name the current request using a controller-style pattern, optionally including the current controller action. If the action is omitted, New Relic will include the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) as the action. The rules for when you can call newrelic.setControllerName() are the same as they are for newrelic.setTransactionName(), including the request naming requirements. Explicitly calling newrelic.setControllerName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. Custom instrumentation API calls Use these API calls to expand your instrumentation with custom instrumentation. newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a specific module. The provided onRequire callback will be fired when the given module is loaded with require. The moduleName parameter should be the string that will be passed to require; for example, 'express' or 'amqplib/callback_api'. The optional onError callback is called if the onRequire parameters throws an error. This is useful for debugging your instrumentation. Use this method to: Add instrumentation for modules not currently instrumented by New Relic. Instrument your own code. Replace the Node.js agent's built-in instrumentation with your own. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a datastore module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a datastore-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js datastore instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) Copy The instrumentLoadedModule method allows you to add stock instrumentation to specific modules in situations where it's impossible to have require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. // load the agent const newrelic = require('newrelic') // module loaded before newrelic const expressModule = require('express') // instrument express _after_ the agent has been loaded newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule( 'express', // the module's name, as a string expressModule // the module instance ); Copy Important This method cannot instrument any arbitrary module. Its purpose is to add modules that were missed because the agent was not loaded as the first thing in your program. The instrumentLoadedModule method can only instrument modules the agent would normally instrument. You can see a list of these modules in the agent's lib/instrumentations module. newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a message service client module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a message-service-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js message service instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a web framework module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a web-framework-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js web framework instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) Copy Instrument the specified web transaction. Using this API call, you can instrument transactions that New Relic does not automatically detect. The url defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The handle defines the function you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startWebTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, [group], handle) newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, [group], handle) Copy Instrument the specified background transaction. Using this API call, you can expand New Relic's instrumentation to capture data from background transactions. The name defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The group is optional, and it allows you to group similar jobs together via the transaction type in the user interface. Like name, the group needs to be static. The handle defines a function that includes the entire background job you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.getTransaction() Copy Returns a handle on the currently executing transaction. This handle can then be used to interact with a given transaction safely from any context. It is best used with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Please refer to the transaction handle section for more details. newrelic.endTransaction() newrelic.endTransaction() Copy End the current web or background custom transaction. This method requires being in the correct transaction context when called. This API call takes no arguments. newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) Copy Instrument a particular method to improve visibility into a transaction, or optionally turn it into a metric. The name defines a name for the segment. This name will be visible in transaction traces and as a new metric in the New Relic UI. The record flag defines whether the segment should be recorded as a metric. The handler is the function you want to track as a segment. The optional callback is a function passed to the handler to fire after its work is done. The agent begins timing the segment when startSegment is called. The segment is ended when either the handler finishes executing, or callback is fired, if it is provided. Custom metrics API calls Use these API calls to record additional arbitrary metrics: newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) Copy Use recordMetric to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The name must be a string following standard metric naming rules. The value will usually be a number, but it can also be an object. When value is a numeric value, it should represent the magnitude of a measurement associated with an event; for example, the duration for a particular method call. When value is an object, it must contain count, total, min, max, and sumOfSquares keys, all with number values. This form is useful to aggregate metrics on your own and report them periodically; for example, from a setInterval. These values will be aggregated with any previously collected values for the same metric. The names of these keys match the names of the keys used by the platform API. newrelic.incrementMetric(name, [amount]) newrelic.incrementMetric(name, [amount]) Copy Use incrementMetric to update a metric that acts as a simple counter. The count of the selected metric will be incremented by the specified amount, defaulting to 1. Custom events API calls Use these API calls to record additional events: newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. Recording a custom event The following example demonstrates recording a custom event with multiple attributes. const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MessagingEvent', attributes) Copy Transaction handle methods This section details the methods provided by the TransactionHandle class instance that can be obtained through newrelic.getTransaction(). Use these methods to interact directly with the current transaction: transactionHandle.end([callback]) transactionHandle.end([callback]) Copy Use transactionHandle.end to end the transaction referenced by the handle instance. The callback is invoked when the transaction has fully ended. The finished transaction passed to the callback as the first argument. transactionHandle.ignore() transactionHandle.ignore() Copy Use transactionHandle.ignore to ignore the transaction referenced by the handle instance. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call acceptDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the headers map that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header: true in the config. This method replaces the deprecated createDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Generating distributed trace headers In the following example, by calling insertDistributedTraceHeaders with an empty object, the appropriate Distributed Trace headers and W3C Trace Context headers will be generated for the transaction. // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // This could be a header object from an incoming request as well const headersObject = {} newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // generate the headers transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call insertDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by insertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated (and now removed as of version 7.0.0) acceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. transportType should be one of the following strings: AMQP HTTP HTTPS IronMQ JMS Kafka Other Queue Unknown headers should be an object containing all the headers in the incoming request. The keys must be lowercase. Accept incoming distributed trace headers The following example demonstrates adding distributed trace headers retrieved from a Kafka message. In this example, we assume that the incoming Kafka message has Distributed Trace headers inserted. // incoming Kafka message headers const headersObject = message.headers // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // accept the headers transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders('Kafka', headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use insertDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For instructions on how to use this call, along with its partner call acceptDistributedTracePayload, see Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. This call is used to implement distributed tracing. It generates a payload that is read by the receiving application with acceptDistributedTracePayload. Important Note: In order to maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, you must generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. The DistributedTracePayload object has two available methods used for generating the payload in different formats: DistributedTracePayload#text: returns a JSON representation of the payload. Link a nested background transaction // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() var jsonPayload = payload.text() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { var backgroundHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // Link the nested transaction by accepting the payload with the background transaction's handle backgroundHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(jsonPayload) }) Copy DistributedTracePayload#httpSafe: returns a base64 encoded JSON representation of the payload. Place payload on an outgoing request // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() // Place the base64 encoded value on an outbound request header. req.headers[myTracingHeader] = payload.httpSafe() Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use acceptDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call createDistributedTracePayload, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting the payload generated by createDistributedTracePayload. transactionHandle.isSampled() transactionHandle.isSampled() Copy Returns whether this trace is being sampled. Other API calls New Relic's Node.js agent includes additional API calls. newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom attribute value to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in APM's transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Add custom attribute newrelic.addCustomAttribute('attribute1', 'value1') Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in the transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Adding custom attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom span attribute value to be displayed along with a transaction trace span in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attribute newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute('attribute1', 'value') Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom span attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace spans in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 'value2' } newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() Copy Returns the HTML snippet to be inserted into the header of HTML pages to enable browser monitoring. The HTML will instruct the browser to fetch a small JavaScript file and start the page timer. newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) Copy Tell the module whether or not to ignore a given request. This allows you to explicitly filter long-polling, irrelevant routes or requests you know will be time-consuming. This also allows you to gather metrics for requests that otherwise would be ignored. To ignore the transaction, set the parameter to true will ignore the transaction. To prevent a transaction from being ignored with this function, pass the parameter false. Passing null or undefined will not change whether the transaction is ignored. Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0. Please use transactionHandle.ignore() newrelic.noticeError(error, [customParameters]) newrelic.noticeError(error, [customParameters]) Copy Use this call if your app is doing its own error handling with domains or try/catch clauses, but you want all of the information about how many errors are coming out of the app to be centrally managed. Unlike other Node.js calls, this can be used outside of route handlers, but it will have additional context if called from within transaction scope. Caution Errors recorded using this method do not obey the ignore_status_codes configuration value. newrelic.shutdown([options], callback) newrelic.shutdown([options], callback) Copy Use this method to gracefully shut down the agent. Option name Type Attributes Default Description collectPendingData boolean Optional false Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. collectPendingData boolean Optional false Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout number Optional 0 The default time before forcing a shutdown. When collectPendingData is true, the agent will wait for a connection before shutting down. This timeout is useful for short lived processes, like AWS Lambda, in order to keep the process from staying open too long, while trying to connect. waitForIdle boolean Optional false If true, the agent will not shut down until there are no active transactions. Example: newrelic.shutdown({collectPendingData: true, timeout: 10000}, (error) => { process.exit() }) Copy newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() Copy Returns key/value pairs which can be used to link traces or entities. It will only contain items with meaningful values. For instance, if distributed tracing is disabled, trace.id will not be included. newrelic.getTraceMetadata() newrelic.getTraceMetadata() Copy Returns and object containing the current trace ID and span ID. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled or an empty object will be returned. Rules for naming and ignoring requests If you do not want to put calls to the New Relic module directly into your application code, you can use pattern-based rules to name requests. There are two sets of rules: one for renaming requests, and one to mark requests to be ignored by New Relic's instrumentation. Here is the structure for rules in New Relic's Node.js agent. rules.name A list of rules of the format {pattern : \"pattern\", name : \"name\"} for matching incoming request URLs to pattern and naming the matching New Relic transaction's name. This acts as a regex replace, where you can set the pattern either as a string, or as a JavaScript regular expression literal, and both pattern and name are required. When passing a regex as a string, escape backslashes, as the agent does not keep them when given as a string in a pattern. Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general, as the patterns will be evaluated in order and are terminal in nature. For more information, see the naming guidelines. This can also be set with the environment variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy Optional rules attributes [#optional-rules] Additional optional attributes are available: Optional rules attributes Description terminate_chain Default: true When set to true (default), no further rules will be evaluated if this rule is a match. Setting this to false is useful when multiple rules should be used together. For example, one rule could be replacing a common pattern in many different URLs, while subsequent rule(s) would be more specific. replace_all Default: false When set to true, all matches of the pattern will be replaced. Otherwise, only the first match will be replaced. Using the g flag with regular expression literal will have the same effect. For example: pattern: '[0-9]+', replace_all: true Copy This has the same effect as pattern: /[0-9]+/g. precedence By default the rules are evaluated in order, from first to last. If you prefer to have complete control over the order, you can give each rule a precedence attribute. The precedence is an integer number, and rules are evaluated in ascending order. If precedence is not explicitly defined, it will be set to 500 by default. Additional attributes are ignored. Testing your naming rules [#testing-rules] The Node.js agent comes with a command-line tool for testing naming rules. For more information, run the following command in terminal window in a directory where your app is installed: node node_modules/.bin/newrelic-naming-rules Copy Naming rule examples [#examples-rules] Here are some examples of naming rules and the results. Match full URL pattern: \"^/items/[0-9]+$\", name: \"/items/:id\" Copy will result in: /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123 => /orders/123 (not replaced since the rule is a full match) Copy Replace first match in URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\" Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/123 Copy Replace all matches in any URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\", replace_all: true Copy will result in: /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/:id Copy Match group references Using regular expression match group references: pattern: '^/(items|orders)/[0-9]+$', name: '/\\\\1/:id' Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id Copy rules.ignore This can also be set via the environment variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited patterns. Currently there is no way to escape commas in patterns. NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES='^/socket\\.io/\\*/xhr-polling,ignore_me' Copy Here are full examples of how rules are included in the configuration file: Naming rule example // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { name : [ { pattern: \"/tables/name-here\", name: \"/name-hererule1\" } ] } Copy Ignoring rule example If you are using socket.io, you will have a use case for ignoring rules right out of the box. To keep socket.io long-polling from dominating your response-time metrics and affecting the Apdex metrics for your application, add a rule such as: // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { ignore : [ '^\\/socket\\.io\\/.*\\/xhr-polling' ] } }; Copy API calls for rules Here are the API calls for naming and ignoring rules with New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.addNamingRule(pattern, name) Programmatic version of rules.name. Once naming rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. Both parameters are required. newrelic.addIgnoringRule(pattern) Programmatic version of rules.ignore. Once ignoring rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. This parameter is required.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. Terragrunt is a thin wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state. In this guide, you will use Terragrunt to generate your Terraform configurations, create files with Terragrunt, and reuse the Terragrunt configuration to manage multiple environments. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic Infrastructure agent for your host. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: You will also need to install Terragrunt to follow this guide: bash Copy $ brew install terragrunt To follow the examples in this guide, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 6 Create a new configuration Terragrunt is a wrapper that provides extra tooling for your Terraform configurations. In the next steps, you will create a new configuration using Terragrunt, Terraform, and New Relic. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terragrunt-config && cd terragrunt-config In the new directory, create a terragrunt.hcl file, create a ./src directory, and create a ./environments directory: bash Copy $ touch terragrunt.hcl $ mkdir src $ mkdir environments Inside of your environments folder, create a folder named dev. In the ./src directory, create a main.tf and provider.tf files: bash Copy $ mkdir environments/dev $ touch src/main.tf $ touch src/provider.tf In the provider.tf file add the appropriate Terraform and New Relic provider configuration information: terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } Copy In the main.tf add a New Relic alert policy named DemoPolicy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Copy In the ./environments/dev directory create a new file named terragrunt.hcl bash Copy $ cd ./environments/dev/ $ touch terragrunt.hcl Within the dev folder update the terragrunt.hcl file by adding the following include statement. The include statement tells Terragrunt to use any .hcl confgiuration files it finds in parent folders. include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } Copy Next, add a Terraform block to provide Terragrunt with a Terraform source reference. terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Now you need to configure the provider with your New Relic account details. You will need your New Relic user API key and account ID. provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you have a single account: The account ID is displayed on the API keys page. If your organization has multiple accounts: From one.newrelic.com, select Entity explorer and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page. Tip Documentation about the New Relic provider is provided on the Terraform doc site. Update the provider.tf file to define the New Relic account variables that will help keep the Terraform configuration dynamic. variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy In your terminal, change directories to the environments/dev folder and run the command terragrunt init: bash Copy $ terragrunt init Terraform init sets up a bit of context, sets up environment variables, and then runs terraform init. You will see the following output: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. [terragrunt] [/Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev] 2021/02/02 13:30:31 Copying lock file [output] from /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev/.terragrunt-cache/e-PoBgWhdv3v8QGOtDQxS_WeYu4/ 69zjIFUfApJiUt8gFmi-6-dcPe8/.terraform.lock.hcl to /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy $ terragrunt plan Terragrunt starts to run but pauses to ask for the inputs to the New Relic account variables added to the provider.tf file. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2/02 13:32:08 Running command: terraform plan var.newrelic_account_id Enter a value: Interrupt received. Exit the terragrunt plan process with CTRL+C . In the environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl file, add an inputs block to provide the values for your New Relic account variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy The updated terragrunt.hcl only has the include, terraform, and inputs block include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Now, when you run terragrunt plan, Terragrunt will provide the input block's values, no longer prompting the command line for values. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Run terragrunt apply. After Terraform finishes process, check your New Relic account for the new Demo Policy. Step 2 of 6 Adding to your configuration Now that you have a basic New Relic configuration created, add configurations built in the Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides in this step. Tip If you haven't done the previous developer guides, you can copy the configurations for this section from the Terragrunt Intro Github Repo. Update the main.tf to include the additional terraform configurations. Update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy You have added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. To clone the module from GitHub, run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply. After Terraform is done processing, You will see your Demo Policy now has two conditions in your New Relic account and one alert channel attached. Step 3 of 6 Using your Environment as a Terragrunt Variable Using Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you are running to the name of the data you are creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create a new input for env_name inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy in the main.tf file add a new variable for 'env_name' variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Using string interpolation, add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks. resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to the configuration name. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Currently, the environment variable name is hardcoded into the root terragrunt.hcl file. You want to avoid having your variables hardcoded, using a terragrunt built-in function will pass the value. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use the path_relative_to_include() built-in function and pass the value has the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output, the env_name variable will have the entire ./environments/dev/ path. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Next, update the terragrunt.hcl to only include 'dev' as the env_name variable. Adding a locals block creates a local variable, using the replace built-in function will remove the unwanted parts of the relative path, and update the inputs block to use the local variable. locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output the env_name variable will now have 'dev:' added. Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Step 4 of 6 Storing the State Remotely At the moment, the state file is local. The next steps will update your Terraform configurations to remove the local state file and use a file stored remotely in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, various state files will need to be store in separate S3 buckets, not to override each other. Terragrunt allows you to generate files on the fly. Adding the remote_state block into the root level terragrunt.hcl file, you will generate a new file named backend.tf. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"my-terraform-state\" key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true } } Copy After adding the remote_state block, you will need to give the configuration for the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state. Tip To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Now, update the remote_state block to provide your S3 bucket and update the key to use the local environment variable created previously. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Next, run terragrunt plan. If you look in the Amazon S3 bucket, you will see a folder named envs. Within the envs folder is a directory called devs containing terraform.tfstate file. Tip To see the files created by Terragrunt, look inside of the ./environments/dev directory. There is a hidden directory named terragrunt-cache. Within the terragrunt-cache directory, you will see the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Step 5 of 6 Creating a New Environment Now that you have a working configuration for your dev environment, you will create a new environment reusing the dev configurations in the next steps. In the environments directory, create a new folder names nonprod. In the nonprod folder, create a new terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl In the nonprod terragrunt.hcl file copy over the configuration from the environment terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you are using a different account for your nonprod environment, you can update the inputs with a new New Relic account ID and API key. Inside of your nonprod directory, run terragrunt init then run terragrunt apply. In the output, you will see Terraform has created a new set of resources. The new resources should have the nonprod name prefixed. Step 6 of 6 Terragrunt has created two environments, but there is no difference between them other than the name. Adding variables in the configurations allows your configurations to be more dynamic. In the next steps, you will add variables to your configurations. In the main.tf add new variables for the Host Conditions modules cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage values: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy In the main.tf update the HostConditions module values to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Run terragrunt plan. In the output, the HostConditions values have changed to use the variable defaults. Next, you want to pass the values into your environment configurations by adding the inputs block variables. In the nonprod/terragrunt.hcl file, add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy Run terragrunt apply. In your New Relic account, you will see a new policy with configurations changed based on the environment. Conclusion Congratulations! You've used Terragrunt to generate your New Relic configurations and manage multiple environments. Review the Terragrunt Intro Example, New Relic Terraform provider documentation, and Terragrunt quick start to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "You can manage your alert notification channels using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. Get notification channels The notificationChannels query allows you to paginate through all of your notification channels per account. You can also use the notificationChannel query to get a specific notification channel by its ID. Tip Note that certain secret fields (for example passwords or API keys) are obfuscated in the returned fields. List all notification channels for an account This example returns every field for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, up to the page limit of 200. Note how we use inline fragments to refer to the specific fields on the concrete types implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { config { integrationUrl } } ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { config { baseUrl basicAuth { password username } customHttpHeaders { name value } customPayloadBody customPayloadType } } ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { config { key routeKey } } ... on AlertsUserNotificationChannel { config { userId } } ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { config { apiKey } } ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { config { apiKey dataCenterRegion recipients tags teams } } ... on AlertsHipChatNotificationChannel { config { authToken baseUrl roomId } } ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { config { emails includeJson } } ... on AlertsCampfireNotificationChannel { config { room subdomain token } } } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Paginate through notification channels with cursor pagination If a given account's list of notification channels exceeds the 200 channel page limit, you can use the pagination cursor to retrieve additional pages. With cursor pagination, you continue to request additional pages using the nextCursor until that field returns empty in the response. An empty nextCursor signals that you have reached the end of the result set. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"notificationChannels\": { \"channels\": [ { \"id\": \"250\", \"name\": \"Channel 1\", \"type\": \"SLACK\" }, { \"id\": \"713\", \"name\": \"Channel 2\", \"type\": \"WEBHOOK\" }, // ... +198 more notification channels in reality ], \"nextCursor\": \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\", \"totalCount\": 268 } } } } } } Copy In your next request, provide the cursor like so, updating each subsequent request to return the updated cursor, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels(cursor: \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\") { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Find a specific notification channel by id If you have a specific notification channel's ID, the API allows you to look it up directly. Note that because the specific channel is a concrete type implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface, you may need to specify certain fields using the ... on syntax for inline fragments. In this example, we are retrieving a Slack channel: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannel(id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id name type ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } } } } } } Copy Create a notification channel In order to create an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to create (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Once a notification channel has been created, it can be associated with one or more alert policies. Once associated, those channels will receive notifications from those policies when conditions are violated. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only create a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Create an email notification channel An example create mutation for an email notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { emails: [\"email@example.com\"], includeJson: true, name: \"Some Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type config { emails includeJson } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an OpsGenie notification channel An example create mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { apiKey: \"api-key-from-opsgenie\", dataCenterRegion: US, name: \"OpsGenie notification channel name\", recipients: [\"user@example.com\"], tags: [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"], teams: [\"team1\", \"team2\"] } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey teams tags recipients dataCenterRegion } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a PagerDuty notification channel An example create mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty notification channel name\", apiKey: \"api-key-from-pagerduty\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Slack notification channel An example create mutation for a Slack notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack notification channel name\", teamChannel: \"#team-channel\", url: \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/FAKE/MOREFAKE/IMAGINARYEXAMPLEURLCHUNK\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type config { teamChannel url } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a VictorOps notification channel An example create mutation for a VictorOps notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { key: \"example-api-key-from-victorops\", name: \"VictorOps notification channel name\", routeKey: \"example-route-key\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type config { key routeKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Webhook notification channel An example create mutation for a Webhook notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { baseUrl: \"https://example.com/webhook\", basicAuth: { password: \"t0t4lly-s3cr3t-p455w0rd\", username: \"webhook-user\" }, customHttpHeaders: [ {name: \"X-Api-Key\", value: \"100%-real-api-key\"}, {name:

{ password username } baseUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an xMatters notification channel An example create mutation for an xMatters notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { integrationUrl: \"https://company.instance.xmatters.com/api/xm/v<version>/...\", name: \"xMatters notification channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type config { integrationUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Update a notification channel In order to update an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to change (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Consistent with other GraphQL APIs, you can update a single field on the channel without knowing anything other than the channel's ID. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only update a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Update an email notification channel An example update mutation for an email notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { name: \"Updated Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an OpsGenie notification channel An example update mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { name: \"OpsGenie updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a PagerDuty notification channel An example update mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Slack notification channel An example update mutation for a Slack notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a VictorOps notification channel An example update mutation for a VictorOps notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { name: \"VictorOps updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Webhook notification channel An example update mutation for a Webhook notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { name: \"Webhook updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an xMatters notification channel An example update mutation for an xMatters notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { name: \"xMatters updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Delete a notification channel You can delete a notification channel with only the account ID and the channel ID. Note that deleting a channel dissociates it from all policies, meaning that no further notifications will be sent to that channel. mutation { alertsNotificationChannelDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Associate channels to a policy Creating an alert notification channel is not enough: Once the channel has been created, it needs to be associated to one or more policies. Once associated to a policy, the channel can recieve alert notifications when conditions on that policy go into violation. In this example, we associate two channels with a policy: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsAddToPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Dissociate a channel from a policy In those instances where a notification channel has outlived its usefulness (for example, an email list that has been retired), the time has come to dissociate that channel from the policy (or policies) that are sending alert notifications to it. This API call leaves the channel itself intact, but removes it from the specified policy. In this example, we are removing two channels from a policy (leaving any others in place), and getting back confirmation that those two channel IDs have been removed: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsRemoveFromPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Tip Removing an alert notification channel from a policy does not delete the policy because it might be used by other policies. On the other hand, deleting a channel will cause all associated channels to stop sending alert notifications to that channel.",

      "info": "Add tags to applications you instrument for easier filtering and organization.",
      "body": "Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Install Snapcraft, and then run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Install Homebrew, and then run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Install Scoop, and then run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Copy or write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity Using your entity guid, you can add tags right away. Invoke the entities tags create command. If you want to add multiple tags, use tag sets: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands.

The API Explorer also includes the curl request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. You can also create alert conditions in the UI. Important For infrastructure alerting, see REST API for infrastructure monitoring alerts. Available data and functions via API REST API functions Comments View account data In general, any role can use a user key or REST API key with GET > List functions to view alerts data. The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for Synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies.

These calls are for conditions with these types of entities: APM: Apps and key transactions Browser: Apps and key transactions Mobile: Mobile apps Exception: The following APM conditions are not available from this API endpoint: Conditions targeting labels (dynamic targeting) Web transaction percentile conditions Baseline conditions Important The API Explorer provides information about other types of conditions using separate endpoints, including external services (APM and mobile), and synthetic monitoring. Consider all types of alert conditions when searching or updating. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create conditions for policies To add conditions to policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy The JSON response returns a condition id, which you will need to update or delete the condition.

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_timer. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "The violation of a condition generates a violation event, which passes important information downstream. For more about the definition of violations and other terms, see Alerts concepts. What is a violation event? The violation of a condition generates a violation event. This event has various attributes (metadata) attached to it and different attributes can be used by different features. Important The violation event is a concept used to determine alerting features. While you can query some of its associated attributes via NerdGraph, you cannot directly query the violation event. Violation event attributes This table shows violation event attributes. The violation event data type is collected in NrAiIncident. BETA FEATURE NrAiIncident is still in development, so may be subject to unannounced changes, but we encourage you to try it out! You may be wondering why we're using NrAiIncident as the name for the violation event data type. Although we currently refer to these events as \"violations,\" they'll be called \"incidents\" in our new, upcoming naming scheme. This name prepares for and reflects our future intentions. All attributes are available for use in a description. Read about attributes available for muting rules. Attribute Description accountId The ID of the account where the violation occurred. Available for muting rules. aggregationDuration The active condition's aggregation window. closeCause If applicable, what caused the incident to close. Available values: CONDITION_DELETED, POLICY_DELETED, EVALUATOR, EXPIRED, CONDITION_MODIFIED, LOSS_OF_SIGNAL, USER, TARGET_REMOVED, and CONDITION_DISABLED. closeTime If applicable, the timestamp when the incident was closed. closeViolationsOnExpiration If true, open violations on the signal are closed if the signal is lost. Default is false. To use this field, an expirationDuration must be specified. conditionId The ID of the condition that triggered the violation. Available for muting rules. conditionName The name of the condition that triggered the violation. Available for muting rules. degradationTime The timestamp when the targeted metric started to breach the active condition’s threshold. description The contents of the active condition’s Violation Description field. NRQL or Infrastructure conditions only. entity.guid The targeted entity's globally unique identifier, if available. entity.name The targeted entity's name, if available. entity.type The targeted entity's type, if available. evaluationOffsetSeconds The active condition's evaluation offset. A time delay (in seconds) to ensure data points are placed in the correct aggregation window. If you use the Delay/timer setting in the UI, it clears evaluationOffsetSeconds and uses Delay/timer instead. evaluationType The reason the violation was opened. Available values: Threshold (the condition threshold was breached) Expiration (the entity's signal was lost) event The record's event type. Available values: Open and Close. expirationDuration The active condition's signal loss time window. incidentID The unique identifier of the violation. muted Shows whether the active condition was muted at the time of the violation event. mutingRuleID The unqiue identifier of the muting rule that caused the violation to be muted. nrqlEventType The type of data targeted by a NRQL condition. In this context, this refers to any NRQL-queryable data type. Available for muting rules. nrqlQuery The full string of the NRQL query. Can be used for sub-string matching on attributes in the WHERE clause. Available for muting rules. openTime The timestamp when the violation was opened. operator The violation threshold's operator, such as =, <, or >. For signal loss violations, this is an empty string. policyId The ID of the policy that triggered the violation. Available for muting rules. policyName The name of the policy that triggered the violation. Available for muting rules. priority The level of the violation: warning or critical. recoveryTime The timestamp when the active condition's targeted metric stops breaching the threshold. runbookUrl The runbook URL for the condition that triggered the violation. Available for muting rules. tags.* Arbitrary key-value metadata, or tags, associated with the violation. tags. is the prefix and * is the metadata/tag name. For details on how to use this, see the documentation for muting rules or description. Available for muting rules. targetName The name of the violation’s target. This can be an entity or a query. Available for muting rules. threshold The active condition's threshold value. thresholdDuration The active condition's threshold time window. thresholdOccurrences Shows whether for at least or at least once in occurrence values are being used in the active condition's threshold. Available values: all or any. timestamp The event's wall clock time using an epoch timestamp. title The incident's title. type The incident's type. Available value: Incident. valueFunction The active condition's aggregation function. Used in APM, browser, and mobile alert condition types. violationTimeLimitSeconds The active condition's violation time limit setting. violationUuId Deprecated. Do not use.",

      "body": "You can use our NerdGraph API to add tags to your data to help improve data organization and findability. Overview This doc explains how to use our NerdGraph API to add and manage tags. Note that this is only one way to add tags. For other methods, see How tags are added. For how to automate tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Read tags for an entity To construct these queries and see responses: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to find the entity and then fetch its tags. Use NerdGraph's tag API to read the existing tags and their values. In this example, our entity is a browser app called Cookie Checkout: { actor { entitySearch (query: \"name like 'Cookie Checkout'\") { results { entities { tags { key values } } } } } } Copy The actual values vary depending on your data. Use the New Relic GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Add tags for an entity To add new tags for an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity you want to tag. Use the taggingAddTagsToEntity mutation to add a tag with a value to the entity. For APM agents, a restart is required after adding a new tag. In this example, we have a browser application called Cookie Checkout owned by a UI team. We want to add a team tag with a ui value to this instance. Once the tag is added, we can filter by the tag team:ui and find the Cookie Checkout app in the New Relic One UI. mutation { taggingAddTagsToEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: { key: \"team\", values: [\"ui\"]}) { errors { message } } } Copy Remove a tag from an entity To delete a tag and all of its associated values from an entity: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagFromEntity mutation. For APM agents, a restart is required after changing tags. The following example mutation removes the team tag from an entity: mutation { taggingDeleteTagFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagKeys: [\"team\"]) { errors { message } } } Copy Delete specific tag values for an entity Instead of deleting an entire tag and all of its values, you can delete a single tag value. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity mutation. The following example mutation deletes the ui value from the tag key: mutation { taggingDeleteTagValuesFromEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tagValues : [{key: \"team\" value: \"ui\"}]) { errors { message } } } Copy Because tagValues is an array, you can delete multiple specific values from a single entity in one mutation. Replace all tag values for an entity To replace the entity’s entire set of tags with the provided tag set: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Use entitySearch() to locate the GUID for the entity with the tag you want to remove. Use the taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity mutation. In this example, the Cookie Checkout browser application was transferred from the ui team to the cookie-dev team. You can replace the tag values for team with the following mutation: mutation { taggingReplaceTagsOnEntity ( guid: \"ENTITY_GUID\", tags: {key: \"team\" values: [\"cookie-dev\"]}) { errors { message } } } Copy",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters When using our API to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

      "body": "Application monitoring tips you need to know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM pro—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Learn about tags. Learn how to add tags. Learn how to query tags. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, APM apps, browser monitoring apps, or hosts) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps. To get started, see Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access How you manage your users depends on which user model your users are on: See original user management docs See New Relic One user management docs",

      "body": "New Relic provides integrations for many popular services and frameworks. If you have New Relic and want to report data from a service we don't have an integration for, there are several ways New Relic lets you create your own integration: With New Relic infrastructure monitoring, you can use our lightweight Flex tool (recommended, documented below) or, to build a complete on-host integration, see our Integrations SDK. Telemetry (metrics, traces) monitoring solutions: Use our Telemetry SDKs. Build a custom New Relic One application that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality. What is Flex? New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one tool that allows you to collect metric data from a wide variety of services. It comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. You can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text): you create a YAML config file, start the Infrastructure agent, and your data is reported to New Relic. Flex can send event and metric data to New Relic from a wide range of sources. Using a simple YAML config file, you can run HTTP/HTTPS requests, run shell commands, and parse file content. You can also use standard regex expressions to customize and control the data gathered from those inputs. See an example config. After collecting and cleaning up the data, you can then query Flex data in New Relic, create custom charts for it, and use that data in your dashboards. Requirements Flex comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. To use Flex, you need: Infrastructure agent version 1.10.7 or higher (update | check version) running on Linux, Windows, or Kubernetes. How does Flex work? Flex uses our infrastructure agent to execute commands that generate the data you want to report. Here's a brief overview of how Flex works to report data: You define the data you want to report in a YAML configuration file, located in the infrastructure agent package. See an example configuration: Example config The following is an example of a Flex configuration for monitoring the uptime of a Linux server. This configuration is placed in a file named flex-uptime.yml. This would be placed in the infrastructure agent's integration configuration section, located at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/flex-uptime.yml. integrations: - name: nri-flex config: name: linuxUptimeIntegration apis: - name: Uptime commands: - run: 'cat /proc/uptime' split: horizontal split_by: \\s+ set_header: [uptimeSeconds,idletimeSeconds] Copy Some notes on what this configuration does: run defines the command to execute. The name indicated by name: Uptime is appended with Sample to generate an event called UptimeSample. The name should not start with the ESX or PCF prefix. The split_by: \\s+ splits the fields based on the space character. The command generates attributes attached to the UptimeSample event. The attributes are named uptimeSeconds and idletimeSeconds. The infrastructure agent runs Flex at a frequency based on its own configuration (default: every 30 seconds) and sends the data to New Relic. You can then query your data, create custom charts with it, and add it to dashboards. Learn more The Flex integration comes bundled with the infrastructure agent. Learn more about requirements.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to New Relic Full-Stack Observability Enterprise or New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent To configure the browser agent to use a FedRAMP-compliant endpoint, you must use the copy-paste method method (other browser agent install methods are not supported) and edit the browser code’s script element tag so that the domain is gov-bam.nr-data.net for both beacon and errorBeacon, like this: window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"gov-bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy Note: You only need to modify the beacon and errorBeacon properties in the NREUM.info object. These values will override the default values found in the NR loader script. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Remote write integration: not available. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

Troubleshoot data ingest with NrIntegrationError Our NrIntegrationError event is used to capture issues related to: Exceeding of our data ingest limits Exceeding of our query limits Malformed data Configuration issues You can run NRQL queries to analyze NrIntegrationError error messages. You can also set up alerts to be notified when specific types of errors, or certain quantities of errors, occur. NrIntegrationError events are primarily categorized by the feature that is sending them, as indicated by the newRelicFeature attribute. Values include: Metrics indicates an issue with Metric API ingest. Event API indicates an issue with Event API ingest. Logs indicates an issue with logs ingest. Distributed Tracing indicates an issue with distributed tracing (Span) data. For attribute definitions, see the data dictionary. Query and alert You can query NrIntegrationError events using NRQL, and set up NRQL alert conditions to get notified when issues happen. Here are some examples of queries: Query of Event API issues Here's a simple query of NrIntegrationError. This one shows Event API ingest issues from the last week, with up to 100 results: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO LIMIT 100 Copy For more detailed queries, see Example queries.

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for many of our more curated tools, such as our open source telemetry integrations and our Telemetry SDKs. Data type Description Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing plan) For organizations on our original pricing plan, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API. Plugins New Relic Plugins have been deprecated. For details, see Plugins EOL.",

Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). If the name begins with anything other than an alphabetical character, enclose the name with backticks in your NRQL query. For example: FROM `0_hello` SELECT count(*) Copy Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",

Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime Use native deploy To use Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with your Node.js app: Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Optional: Set environment variables to configure the Node.js agent's GAE app.yaml file. Use the Google Cloud SDK's gcloud command line tool to deploy GAE apps. To deploy your Node.js app to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project new-relic-apm-nodejs app deploy Copy Google App Engine automatically includes your Node.js app's newrelic.js configuration file in the deployed package. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. You can deploy the app without any special configuration.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using Full-Stack Observability options like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance.

You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). If the name begins with anything other than an alphabetical character, enclose the name with backticks in your NRQL query. For example: FROM `0_hello` SELECT count(*) Copy Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default mobile monitoring events using the mobile agent SDKs. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the crash event trail UI. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams. Be sure to follow your organization's obligations for notices and consent regulations.",

Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL conditions produce a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL conditions, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation duration window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple aggregation functions Each condition can only target a single aggregated value. To alert on multiple values simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline condition types. The outlier condition type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy NRQL conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window duration is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period NRQL conditions evaluate data based on how it's aggregated, using aggregation windows from 15 seconds to 15 minutes, in increments of 15 seconds. For best results, we recommend using the event flow or event timer aggregation methods. For the cadence aggregation method, the implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your delay/timer setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window duration, the delay/timer, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert condition types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of conditions: NRQL alert condition types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL condition. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) condition types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. Note that when you have a faceted query, each facet is a signal. So if any one of those signals ends during the duration specified, that will be considered a loss of signal. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, use the advanced signal settings to control streaming alert data and avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window duration Delay/timer Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window duration You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between 15 seconds and 15 minutes, in 15-second increments. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Delay/timer You can adjust the delay/timer to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's behavior. If it takes your data is sparse or inconsistent, you may want to use the event timer aggregation method. For the cadence method, the total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration added to the delay/timer. If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using the event flow method with the default settings. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you use the event timer method. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

Pixie integration The Pixie integration runs in your Kubernetes cluster and pulls a set of curated observability data from Pixie to send it to New Relic using the OpenTelemetry line protocol. The Pixie integration requires outbound network access to the following: work.withpixie.ai:443 otlp.nr-data.net:4317 (US region accounts) otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 (EU region accounts) OpenTelemetry New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. To export OTLP data to New Relic, configure the OTLP exporter to add a header ( api-key ) whose value is your account license key. And, based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. See the OpenTelemetry quick start for more information. otlp.nr-data.net:4317 (US region accounts) otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 (EU region accounts) Network blocks for US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 Network blocks for EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22",

      "body": "Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need a New Relic user key: You can view and create them in the API keys UI. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Install Snapcraft, and then run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Install Homebrew, and then run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Install Scoop, and then run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us $ # Set the profile as default $ newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In this example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. bash Copy $ # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities $ newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Copy or write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity Using your entity guid, you can add tags right away. Invoke the entities tags create command. If you want to add multiple tags, use tag sets: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. bash Copy $ # Adding a single tag $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value $ # Adding multiple tags $ newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "With secrets management, you can configure the agent and on-host integrations to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the configuration files. Currently, Hashicorp Vault, AWS KMS, CyberArk, and New Relic CLI obfuscation are supported. Define secrets To use secrets in a configuration YAML file: Define a variables section, where each entry is a name for a secret object. In each entry, include the source of the secret and the proper configuration to retrieve those secrets. In the general configuration section, set ${variable.property} placeholders that will be automatically replaced by the properties of the secret object. The secret object can be defined as a simple string or json object. Important If the secrets retrieval fails, the integration won't be executed, as the infrastructure agent does not have all the data it requires to execute. For example, the following configuration will retrieve an object named creds from Vault (you can define the object's name for the secret.) Let's assume that the stored object is a valid JSON with a property named user and another property named password. We want to use them to set the basic HTTP credentials of the status_url property from an Nginx on-host integration: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Tip Both simple strings and valid JSON objects can be retrieved from variables. When using JSON objects make sure both keys and values are enclosed with double-quotes. Using environment variables Environment variables can be used into the variables section with the {{MY_ENV_VAR}} notation. When doing so, environment variables are expanded and their value is replaced at runtime. Use this method to avoid having sensitive values such as tokens or obfuscation keys included in the configuration file. When using environment variables in on-host integration configuration files the passthrough_environment setting must be defined. Secrets variables Define secrets in each configuration under a variables section. Each entry is a user-defined secret name that will store the properties of the retrieved secrets. Each variable can contain the following properties: YAML key Description ttl Type: String Amount of time before a secret is refreshed. This can be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h). Examples: 30s, 10m, 1h Default: 1h aws-kms AWS KMS secret retrieval configuration vault Vault secret retrieval configuration cyberark-cli CyberArk command line interface configuration cyberark-api CyberArk REST API configuration obfuscated New Relic CLI obfuscation AWS KMS secrets To retrieve your secrets from Amazon KMS, you can set the following properties in your aws-kms section. Not all fields are required. For example, you will need either data, file, or http to provide the encoded KMS string. YAML key Description data Type: String Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt file Type: String Path to file containing Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt http Type: YAML properties HTTP configuration to use to request Base64 encoded KMS string to decrypt. For more information, see Vault http. credential_file Type: String Path to AWS credentials file config_file Type: String Path to AWS config file region Type: String AWS KMS region type Type: String (plain, equal, or json) Secret value format: plain: a raw string to be stored directly into the destination variable. equal: a key=property one-line string to be stored as object properties into the destination variable. json: a JSON object to be stored as properties into the destination variable. Secrets of type plain or json use dot notation; for example, ${mysecret.nestedkey}. The following example will allow retrieving a plain password string from AWS KMS. It must be decrypted from the provided data encoded string. variables: myPassword: aws-kms: data: T0hBSStGTEVY region: ap-southeast-2 credential_file: \"./my-aws-credentials-file\" config_file: \"./my-aws-config-file\" type: plain Copy Vault secrets Vault must enable an http field containing the HTTP configuration used to connect to Vault. The http entry can contain the following entries: YAML key Description url Type: String URL to request data from tls_config Type: YAML properties Use the TLS configuration properties headers Type: YAML map Request headers tls_config properties Important Secrets must use dot notation, for example, ${mysecret.nestedkey}. YAML key Description enable Type: Boolean Enable TLS Default: false insecure_skip_verify Type: Boolean Skip verifying server’s certificate chain and host Default: false min_version Type: UInt16 The minimum SSL/TLS version that is acceptable Default: 0 (which uses TLS version 1.0) max_version Type: UInt16 The maximum SSL/TLS version that is acceptable Default: 0 (which uses TLS version 1.3) ca Type: String TLS certificate \"\" The following example will retrieve a secret using a Vault token from a secured server, and skip the server certificates verification: variables: mydata: vault: http: url: https://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token tls_config: insecure_skip_verify: true Copy CyberArk command line interface To retrieve secrets from the CyberArk command line interface (CLI) use the following configuration, all keys are required YAML Key Description cli Type: string Full path to the CyberArk CLI executable Default: \"\" app-id Type: string Application id of the secret holder Default: \"\" safe Type: string Safe containing the secret Default: \"\" folder Type: string Folder containing the secret Default: \"\" object Type: string The object the secret is associated with Default: \"\" The following example will retrieve a CyberArk secret using the command line interface: variables: credentials: cyberark-cli: cli: /full/path/to/clipasswordsdk app-id: my-appid safe: my-safe folder: my-folder object: my-object Copy CyberArk REST API To retrieve secrets using the CyberArk REST API there must be a http key containing the HTTP configuration. The http key contains these sub-keys, only url is required: YAML key Description url Type: String URL to request data from, this key is required Default: none tls_config Type: YAML properties Use the TLS configuration properties headers Type: YAML map Request headers The following example will retrieve a secret using the CyberArk REST API, skipping server certificate verification: variables: credentials: cyberark-api: http: url: https://hostname/AIMWebService/api/Accounts?AppID=myAppID&Query=Safe=mySafe;Object=myObject tls_config: insecure_skip_verify: true Copy New Relic CLI Obfuscation Important We recommend using any of the supported secrets providers instead of the simple obfuscation when possible. See our guidelines below to define environment variables to avoid having the obfuscation key in configuration files. Tip Infrastructure Agent 1.14.0 or above is required You can use the New Relic CLI obfuscate command to obscure sensitive information in the infrastructure agent or any on-host integration configuration file. Steps: Install the New Relic CLI on any host (it can be your development host). Run the CLI obfuscate command in order to generate the obfuscated value: newrelic agent config obfuscate --value '<plain_text_config_value>' --key '<obfuscation_key>' Copy Copy the result of the cli command into the text argument in the obfuscated section as shown in the examples below. You can obfuscate JSON blocks if you need to reference multiple values in your configuration YML file. Note that you may need to escape the quotation marks \"\" with backslashes on Windows hosts. For example: '{\\\"attribute\\\":\\\"value\\\".... In addition, use Powershell on Windows hosts, rather than the Command Prompt window, since the Command Prompt window can handle quotation marks in unexpected ways. newrelic agent config obfuscate --value '{\"attribute\":\"value\", \"attribute2\":\"value2\"}' --key '<obfuscation_key>' Copy YAML key Description key Type: String The string used when obfuscating the clear-text value using New Relic CLI Default: none secret Type: String The output of the newrelic-cli command Default: none Integrations configuration example The following example will allow retrieving the Nginx user and password that has been obfuscated using the New Relic CLI. This example uses dot notation when retrieving the credentials, since the obfuscated value was a JSON block: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: obfuscated: key: 'random_key_used_in_cli' secret: 'obscured_output_from_cli' instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true Copy It's recommended to use environment variables for the obfuscation arguments as shown in the example below: integration_name: com.newrelic.nginx variables: creds: obfuscated: key: {{OBFUSCATION_KEY}} secret: {{OBFUSCATION_TEXT}} instances: - name: nginx-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://${creds.user}:${creds.password}@example.com/status status_module: discover remote_monitoring: true Copy Agent configuration example This example allows retrieving a string that contains the proxy details (user, password and host): variables: obfuscated_proxy: obfuscated: key: 'random_key_used_in_cli' secret: 'obscured_output_from_cli' proxy: ${obfuscated_proxy} Copy",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostConditions directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your main.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add main.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline.

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.12\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes.

      "body": "You can manage your alert notification channels using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. Get notification channels The notificationChannels query allows you to paginate through all of your notification channels per account. You can also use the notificationChannel query to get a specific notification channel by its ID. Tip Note that certain secret fields (for example passwords or API keys) are obfuscated in the returned fields. List all notification channels for an account This example returns every field for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, up to the page limit of 200. Note how we use inline fragments to refer to the specific fields on the concrete types implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { config { integrationUrl } } ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { config { baseUrl basicAuth { password username } customHttpHeaders { name value } customPayloadBody customPayloadType } } ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { config { key routeKey } } ... on AlertsUserNotificationChannel { config { userId } } ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { config { apiKey } } ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { config { apiKey dataCenterRegion recipients tags teams } } ... on AlertsHipChatNotificationChannel { config { authToken baseUrl roomId } } ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { config { emails includeJson } } ... on AlertsCampfireNotificationChannel { config { room subdomain token } } } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Paginate through notification channels with cursor pagination If a given account's list of notification channels exceeds the 200 channel page limit, you can use the pagination cursor to retrieve additional pages. With cursor pagination, you continue to request additional pages using the nextCursor until that field returns empty in the response. An empty nextCursor signals that you have reached the end of the result set. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"notificationChannels\": { \"channels\": [ { \"id\": \"250\", \"name\": \"Channel 1\", \"type\": \"SLACK\" }, { \"id\": \"713\", \"name\": \"Channel 2\", \"type\": \"WEBHOOK\" }, // ... +198 more notification channels in reality ], \"nextCursor\": \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\", \"totalCount\": 268 } } } } } } Copy In your next request, provide the cursor like so, updating each subsequent request to return the updated cursor, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels(cursor: \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\") { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Find a specific notification channel by id If you have a specific notification channel's ID, the API allows you to look it up directly. Note that because the specific channel is a concrete type implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface, you may need to specify certain fields using the ... on syntax for inline fragments. In this example, we are retrieving a Slack channel: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannel(id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id name type ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } } } } } } Copy Create a notification channel In order to create an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to create (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Once a notification channel has been created, it can be associated with one or more alert policies. Once associated, those channels will receive notifications from those policies when conditions are violated. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only create a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Create an email notification channel An example create mutation for an email notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { emails: [\"email@example.com\"], includeJson: true, name: \"Some Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type config { emails includeJson } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an OpsGenie notification channel An example create mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { apiKey: \"api-key-from-opsgenie\", dataCenterRegion: US, name: \"OpsGenie notification channel name\", recipients: [\"user@example.com\"], tags: [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"], teams: [\"team1\", \"team2\"] } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey teams tags recipients dataCenterRegion } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a PagerDuty notification channel An example create mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty notification channel name\", apiKey: \"api-key-from-pagerduty\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Slack notification channel An example create mutation for a Slack notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack notification channel name\", teamChannel: \"#team-channel\", url: \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/FAKE/MOREFAKE/IMAGINARYEXAMPLEURLCHUNK\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type config { teamChannel url } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a VictorOps notification channel An example create mutation for a VictorOps notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { key: \"example-api-key-from-victorops\", name: \"VictorOps notification channel name\", routeKey:

notification channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type config { integrationUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Update a notification channel In order to update an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to change (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Consistent with other GraphQL APIs, you can update a single field on the channel without knowing anything other than the channel's ID. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only update a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Update an email notification channel An example update mutation for an email notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { name: \"Updated Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an OpsGenie notification channel An example update mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { name: \"OpsGenie updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a PagerDuty notification channel An example update mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Slack notification channel An example update mutation for a Slack notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a VictorOps notification channel An example update mutation for a VictorOps notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { name: \"VictorOps updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Webhook notification channel An example update mutation for a Webhook notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { name: \"Webhook updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an xMatters notification channel An example update mutation for an xMatters notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { name: \"xMatters updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Delete a notification channel You can delete a notification channel with only the account ID and the channel ID. Note that deleting a channel dissociates it from all policies, meaning that no further notifications will be sent to that channel. mutation { alertsNotificationChannelDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Associate channels to a policy Creating an alert notification channel is not enough: Once the channel has been created, it needs to be associated to one or more policies. Once associated to a policy, the channel can recieve alert notifications when conditions on that policy go into violation. In this example, we associate two channels with a policy: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsAddToPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Dissociate a channel from a policy In those instances where a notification channel has outlived its usefulness (for example, an email list that has been retired), the time has come to dissociate that channel from the policy (or policies) that are sending alert notifications to it. This API call leaves the channel itself intact, but removes it from the specified policy. In this example, we are removing two channels from a policy (leaving any others in place), and getting back confirmation that those two channel IDs have been removed: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsRemoveFromPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Tip Removing an alert notification channel from a policy does not delete the policy because it might be used by other policies. On the other hand, deleting a channel will cause all associated channels to stop sending alert notifications to that channel.",

If left empty, make sure you pass title so that users get a reference about the data the column shows. classNamestring Appends class names to the component. onClickfunction Callback fired any time the user clicks on the header. When clicked, sorting information (and the next sorting state) will be passed as the second parameter. Use it rather than computing it yourself. function ( event : React.MouseEvent, sortingData : Object ) sortableboolean DEFAULT false Whether the column is sortable. This means that the up and down arrows will be shown, side to the heading text. Sorting is a controlled component interface, you are in charge of listening for the sorting event and applying the sorting to the corresponding column, by changing its sortingOrder prop. sortingFunctionfunction Method for sorting rows. The default method will usually do the right thing (alphabetical ordering for text, numerical ordering for numbers and boolean grouping), but if needed this can be overridden. The function takes two parameters (a and b) and has to return a negative number if a is considered to appear before b, a positive one if it's considered to appear after, and zero if both values are identical. Each of the objects passed to the callback contains the value for the given row (i.e. the result of calling value over the row), the row item (as item), the index of the row (as index) and all the items in the items array (as items). Generally you will compare rows using a.item and b.item. function ( a : object, b : object ) => number sortingOrdernumber DEFAULT Number . MAX_SAFE_INTEGER Establishes the sorting order. A lowest number indicates a highest sorting priority, meaning that 0 will be the first column sorted, and if two items are identical, we will use column 1 and so on. Columns that do not have an explicit sorting order are used after all columns that do have it, and they are applied in order of appearance. sortingTypeenum DEFAULT TableHeaderCell . SORTING_TYPE . NONE Establishes the sorting for the column. Columns are sorted based on the element returned by the value prop. <One of TableHeaderCell.SORTING_TYPE.ASCENDING , TableHeaderCell.SORTING_TYPE.DESCENDING , TableHeaderCell.SORTING_TYPE.NONE , > styleobject Inline style for custom styling. testIdstring Adds a data-test-id attribute. Use it to target the component in unit and e2e tests. titlestring Establishes the title of the cell. This is used for tooltip purposes, when the width of the column is small enough to not show the entire heading. Defaults to the stringified version of the provided children. valuefunction Function that is used to extract the raw value representing a column. The raw value may be a boolean (e.g. if you render a checkbox), a number (if you render a metric) or text for others. It is called with an object containing the item representing the row, its index in the items array passed to the table, and the items themselves. This function is used for sorting the table (by the given value) as well as for the heuristics of 'fit-content' widths. widthstring DEFAULT 1fr Represents the width of the column. It is always a string, and it can be of one of the following types: 'fit-content': the column will take the minimum required space to allocate all items in the column. For virtualized lists, a heuristic will be used to avoid rendering all cells. 'YYpx': where YY is a number, represents the width of the column in pixels. 'YY%': where YY is a number, represents the width of the column in percentage, relative to the size of the available space where the table is being rendered. 'YYfr': where YY is a number, it represents a fraction of the available width. Fractions are proportional ones to others; for instance, a table with two columns (1fr and 2fr) will have the second column twice as large as the first one. If, after computing the widths, the overall size of the table does not cover the available space, all columns will be proportionally stretched to fit all available space.",

Should be used only for positioning and spacing purposes. compactboolean DEFAULT false Establishes whether the table should render in compact mode (compact mode has narrower rows). In general, use the standard mode, since compact is reserved for data representation, e.g. in a dashboard. itemsany[] DEFAULT [] The items to be used when rendering. They are required when rendering items with a render callback. Each item can have any structure and type possible, and will the corresponding one will be provided when rendering each element list. mainColumnnumber DEFAULT 0 Column containing the main data identifying the row. Often the first column (index 0) is the relevant one, but actions (like favorites) could be placed before it. onLoadMorefunction Callback fired when more items must be loaded. This happens when you're lazy loading the items and the items that are about to render cannot be found in the items array. This callback should be used to fetch/load the missing items from the backend or other sources. The returned Promise should be resolved once item data has finished loading. It will be used to determine when to refresh the list with the newly-loaded data. This callback may be called multiple times in reaction to a single scroll event. function ( cursor : Cursor Items to load. ) onSelectfunction Function called when the user clicks over a row checkbox. It is called with the event of the checkbox, as well as with an object containing the item representing the row, its index in the items array passed to the table, and the items themselves. When the user selects or unselects the header checkbox (select / unselect all), the callback will be called once for every item, representing individual clicks over each row. The header checkbox state is automatically controlled by the table. function ( event : React.ChangeEvent, selectedItem : SelectedCallbackArgument ) rowCountnumber Number of rows. By default it's equal to length of array passed in the items prop. You should specify the rowCount when you know the total number of items but you want to lazy load them while scrolling. selectedfunction Function that returns whether a row is selected. It needs to return a boolean representing the state of the row. It is called with an object containing the item representing the row, its index in the items array passed to the table, and the items themselves. function ( item : SelectedCallbackArgument ) => boolean selectionTypeenum DEFAULT Table . SELECTION_TYPE . BULK Sets the selection mode of the Table. Use it along with onSelect and selected props to determine which row is checked by the user. Table.SELECTION_TYPE.BULK displays checkboxes per each row, along with a checkbox in the header to select all items. When an item is selected, header actions become available. Table.SELECTION_TYPE.SINGLE doesn't display checkboxes, the user picks a row by just clicking on it. Though not enforced in the component, the selected callback should return true only for one item. Check the examples of the component to see how it works. <One of Table.SELECTION_TYPE.BULK , Table.SELECTION_TYPE.SINGLE , > spacingTypeenum[] Spacing property.

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution The Docker CPM is not designed for use with container orchestrators like AWS ECS, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Azure Container Instances, etc. Running the Docker CPM in a container orchestrator will result in unexpected issues because it is itself a container orchestrator. If you're using container orchestration, see our Kubernetes CPM requirements. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the account switcher. account switcher If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account organization, you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: *EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) *CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. *EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, as well as the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing plan, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our Full Stack Observability pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Kubernetes integration you can monitor both Kubernetes and the services running on it, such as Cassandra, Redis, MySQL, and other supported services. Get started Our Kubernetes integration comes bundled with some of our on-host integrations (like Cassandra, MySQL, and Apache). This lets you get data for those supported services by adding a section to the Kubernetes integration's configuration, which lives as a ConfigMap inside a manifest. What you need Enable this feature for a service Details about how configuration works For an example of how to monitor Redis running on a Kubernetes PHP Guestbook, see this tutorial. What you need To monitor services running on Kubernetes, you only need a Kubernetes cluster running the Kubernetes integration, version 1.16.0 or higher (install | check version | update). We support the following services running on Kubernetes: Apache (does not report inventory data) Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ (does not report inventory data) Redis SNMP Enable monitoring of services To enable our Kubernetes integration to monitor one or more services: Expand this dropdown and get the YAML snippets for the service(s) you want to monitor: Get the config YAML for the integration For the services you want to monitor, follow the links to GitHub to get the YAML snippets you'll need for the next step: Apache Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ Redis SNMP Add the snippet to the Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap, after the data: section: Example configuration This example shows the YAML config for the Apache integration ( highlighted ) added to the Kubernetes integration's config.

See an example. Depending on your environment, you may need or want to set additional config options. Expand the dropdown below for links to configuration options. Configuration options for each integration Select a service to see available config options: Apache Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ Redis SNMP Verify monitoring is enabled: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure, select Third party services, and then select the service's dashboard. You should see data being reported. Additional notes about enabling services: Enabling multiple services may use more resources than what is set in the resource limits of the Kubernetes integration config file. If this becomes an issue, raise the limit in the resources section. The Kubernetes integration does not automatically update. For best results, regularly update. Monitor services in our Kubernetes integration installed with Helm If you installed our Kubernetes integration using Helm, to monitor services you need to update the existing installation with the new configuration, which contains the services to monitor: helm upgrade --reuse-values -f values.yaml [RELEASE] [CHART] Copy If you use nri-bundle charts, you need to update the children's chart values. Find some examples here. Learn more More resources for learning about configuration: Learn technical details about how configuration works. Learn how to configure monitoring of multiple services with the same config file. See a step-by-step tutorial showing how to monitor a Redis service on Kubernetes. Manually configure service monitoring The enable procedure should be all you need to get monitoring working, but if you run into problems, understanding some technical details about configuration can be helpful. This section goes into more detail about how configuration works. For each service you wish to monitor, you must add a configuration file for that integration to our Kubernetes integration's configuration. This document will cover these subjects: How the service-specific configuration YAML snippet works Adding the service-specific YAML in the Kubernetes integration's config file Adding multiple services to the Kubernetes integration's config file How the service-specific YAML config works Our Kubernetes integration's configuration follows the ConfigMap format. Using a ConfigMap allows us to decouple the configuration for the integrations from the Kubernetes image. The other benefit is that a ConfigMap can be updated automatically without reloading the running container. Because the infrastructure agent uses YAML to configure its associated integrations, ConfigMaps are a good choice for storing YAML. (For more information on config file format, see the Integration config file format.) The Kubernetes integration image comes with an auto-discovery feature that simplifies the configuration of multiple instances of services using a single configuration file. For example, if you have several NGINX instances running, creating an NGINX integration configuration file for every instance would be hard to implement and hard to update. With our auto-discovery option, you can discover and monitor all your NGINX instances with a single configuration file. Each integration has its own specific configuration YAML. Our NGINX integration default config file looks like this: nginx-config.yml: | --- discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet. Default is 10255 # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # Custom Example: # exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes --namespaces namespace1,namespace2 --port 10250 --tls # Default exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes match: label.app: nginx integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}/status STATUS_MODULE: discover METRICS: 1 Copy The above config enables the following: Runs nri-discovery-kubernetes to query the data for the node we are currently on. Parses the data that comes back and looks for any Kubernetes pod that has a Kubernetes container with an app= label with value nginx. For any matches, it attempts to run the NGINX integration. The status URL is built from: The pod's IP address The status page is pulled from the label on K8s pod called status_url This automatic discovery works the same as the container auto-discovery used by the infrastructure agent. For more advanced options, see Container auto-discovery. Add a service YAML to the Kubernetes integration config It's best practice to configure enabled integrations alongside the Kubernetes integration configuration. This is easier than maintaining configuration files for every single service/integration instance. Below is an example of a Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap. The highlighted section shows where an integration configuration YAML (in this case, NGINX) is placed. For more information on discovery:, see Container auto-discovery for on-host integrations. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet. Default is 10255 exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes --port PORT --tls match: label.app: nginx integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: # If you're using ngx_http_api_module be certain to use the full path up to and including the version number # Use the discovered IP as the host address STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}/status # Comma separated list of ngx_http_api_module, NON PARAMETERIZED, Endpoints # endpoints: /nginx,/processes,/connections,/ssl,/slabs,/http,/http/requests,/http/server_zones,/http/caches,/http/upstreams,/http/keyvals,/stream,/stream/server_zones,/stream/upstreams,/stream/keyvals,/stream/zone_sync # Name of Nginx status module OHI is to query against. discover | ngx_http_stub_status_module | ngx_http_status_module | ngx_http_api_module STATUS_MODULE: discover METRICS: 1 Copy This configuration map can then be referenced in the DaemonSet, the same as the one that was generated via the command line. Make sure the namespace used is the same one used by the Kubernetes integration manifest. If you haven't changed it in the downloaded manifest file, the value is default. Add multiple services to the same config You can monitor several services using the same Kubernetes integration config file. To do this, add another integration configuration YAML to the same Kubernetes integration config file. Below is the Kubernetes config created in the last section, with a new section for the Cassandra integration's config (highlighted). --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Run discovery for Kubernetes.

Additionally, depending on your environment, there may be some additional service-specific configuration you must do.

      "info": "Learn how to provision New Relic resources using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).",
      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.21\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostConditions directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your main.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add main.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible.

You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. Terragrunt is a thin wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state. In this guide, you will use Terragrunt to generate your Terraform configurations, create files with Terragrunt, and reuse the Terragrunt configuration to manage multiple environments. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic Infrastructure agent for your host. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: You will also need to install Terragrunt to follow this guide: bash Copy $ brew install terragrunt To follow the examples in this guide, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 6 Create a new configuration Terragrunt is a wrapper that provides extra tooling for your Terraform configurations. In the next steps, you will create a new configuration using Terragrunt, Terraform, and New Relic. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terragrunt-config && cd terragrunt-config In the new directory, create a terragrunt.hcl file, create a ./src directory, and create a ./environments directory: bash Copy $ touch terragrunt.hcl $ mkdir src $ mkdir environments Inside of your environments folder, create a folder named dev. In the ./src directory, create a main.tf and provider.tf files: bash Copy $ mkdir environments/dev $ touch src/main.tf $ touch src/provider.tf In the provider.tf file add the appropriate Terraform and New Relic provider configuration information: terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } Copy In the main.tf add a New Relic alert policy named DemoPolicy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Copy In the ./environments/dev directory create a new file named terragrunt.hcl bash Copy $ cd ./environments/dev/ $ touch terragrunt.hcl Within the dev folder update the terragrunt.hcl file by adding the following include statement. The include statement tells Terragrunt to use any .hcl confgiuration files it finds in parent folders. include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } Copy Next, add a Terraform block to provide Terragrunt with a Terraform source reference. terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Now you need to configure the provider with your New Relic account details. You will need your New Relic user API key and account ID. provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you have a single account: The account ID is displayed on the API keys page. If your organization has multiple accounts: From one.newrelic.com, select Entity explorer and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page. Tip Documentation about the New Relic provider is provided on the Terraform doc site. Update the provider.tf file to define the New Relic account variables that will help keep the Terraform configuration dynamic. variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy In your terminal, change directories to the environments/dev folder and run the command terragrunt init: bash Copy $ terragrunt init Terraform init sets up a bit of context, sets up environment variables, and then runs terraform init. You will see the following output: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. [terragrunt] [/Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev] 2021/02/02 13:30:31 Copying lock file [output] from /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev/.terragrunt-cache/e-PoBgWhdv3v8QGOtDQxS_WeYu4/ 69zjIFUfApJiUt8gFmi-6-dcPe8/.terraform.lock.hcl to /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy $ terragrunt plan Terragrunt starts to run but pauses to ask for the inputs to the New Relic account variables added to the provider.tf file. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2/02 13:32:08 Running command: terraform plan var.newrelic_account_id Enter a value: Interrupt received. Exit the terragrunt plan process with CTRL+C . In the environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl file, add an inputs block to provide the values for your New Relic account variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy The updated terragrunt.hcl only has the include, terraform, and inputs block include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Now, when you run terragrunt plan, Terragrunt will provide the input block's values, no longer prompting the command line for values. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Run terragrunt apply. After Terraform finishes process, check your New Relic account for the new Demo Policy. Step 2 of 6 Adding to your configuration Now that you have a basic New Relic configuration created, add configurations built in the Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides in this step. Tip If you haven't done the previous developer guides, you can copy the configurations for this section from the Terragrunt Intro Github Repo. Update the main.tf to include the additional terraform configurations. Update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy You have added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. To clone the module from GitHub, run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply. After Terraform is done processing, You will see your Demo Policy now has two conditions in your New Relic account and one alert channel attached. Step 3 of 6 Using your Environment as a Terragrunt Variable Using Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you are running to the name of the data you are creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create a new input for env_name inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy in the main.tf file add a new variable for 'env_name' variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Using string interpolation, add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks. resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to the configuration name. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Currently, the environment variable name is hardcoded into the root terragrunt.hcl file. You want to avoid having your variables hardcoded, using a terragrunt built-in function will pass the value. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use the path_relative_to_include() built-in function and pass the value has the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output, the env_name variable will have the entire ./environments/dev/ path. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Next, update the terragrunt.hcl to only include 'dev' as the env_name variable. Adding a locals block creates a local variable, using the replace built-in function will remove the unwanted parts of the relative path, and update the inputs block to use the local variable. locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output the env_name variable will now have 'dev:' added. Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Step 4 of 6 Storing the State Remotely At the moment, the state file is local. The next steps will update your Terraform configurations to remove the local state file and use a file stored remotely in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, various state files will need to be store in separate S3 buckets, not to override each other. Terragrunt allows you to generate files on the fly. Adding the remote_state block into the root level terragrunt.hcl file, you will generate a new file named backend.tf. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"my-terraform-state\" key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true } } Copy After adding the remote_state block, you will need to give the configuration for the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state. Tip To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Now, update the remote_state block to provide your S3 bucket and update the key to use the local environment variable created previously. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Next, run terragrunt plan. If you look in the Amazon S3 bucket, you will see a folder named envs. Within the envs folder is a directory called devs containing terraform.tfstate file. Tip To see the files created by Terragrunt, look inside of the ./environments/dev directory. There is a hidden directory named terragrunt-cache. Within the terragrunt-cache directory, you will see the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Step 5 of 6 Creating a New Environment Now that you have a working configuration for your dev environment, you will create a new environment reusing the dev configurations in the next steps. In the environments directory, create a new folder names nonprod. In the nonprod folder, create a new terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl In the nonprod terragrunt.hcl file copy over the configuration from the environment terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you are using a different account for your nonprod environment, you can update the inputs with a new New Relic account ID and API key. Inside of your nonprod directory, run terragrunt init then run terragrunt apply. In the output, you will see Terraform has created a new set of resources. The new resources should have the nonprod name prefixed. Step 6 of 6 Terragrunt has created two environments, but there is no difference between them other than the name. Adding variables in the configurations allows your configurations to be more dynamic. In the next steps, you will add variables to your configurations. In the main.tf add new variables for the Host Conditions modules cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage values: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy In the main.tf update the HostConditions module values to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Run terragrunt plan. In the output, the HostConditions values have changed to use the variable defaults. Next, you want to pass the values into your environment configurations by adding the inputs block variables. In the nonprod/terragrunt.hcl file, add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy Run terragrunt apply. In your New Relic account, you will see a new policy with configurations changed based on the environment. Conclusion Congratulations! You've used Terragrunt to generate your New Relic configurations and manage multiple environments. Review the Terragrunt Intro Example, New Relic Terraform provider documentation, and Terragrunt quick start to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "You can manage your alert notification channels using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. Get notification channels The notificationChannels query allows you to paginate through all of your notification channels per account. You can also use the notificationChannel query to get a specific notification channel by its ID. Tip Note that certain secret fields (for example passwords or API keys) are obfuscated in the returned fields. List all notification channels for an account This example returns every field for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, up to the page limit of 200. Note how we use inline fragments to refer to the specific fields on the concrete types implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { config { integrationUrl } } ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { config { baseUrl basicAuth { password username } customHttpHeaders { name value } customPayloadBody customPayloadType } } ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { config { key routeKey } } ... on AlertsUserNotificationChannel { config { userId } } ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { config { apiKey } } ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { config { apiKey dataCenterRegion recipients tags teams } } ... on AlertsHipChatNotificationChannel { config { authToken baseUrl roomId } } ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { config { emails includeJson } } ... on AlertsCampfireNotificationChannel { config { room subdomain token } } } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Paginate through notification channels with cursor pagination If a given account's list of notification channels exceeds the 200 channel page limit, you can use the pagination cursor to retrieve additional pages. With cursor pagination, you continue to request additional pages using the nextCursor until that field returns empty in the response. An empty nextCursor signals that you have reached the end of the result set. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"notificationChannels\": { \"channels\": [ { \"id\": \"250\", \"name\": \"Channel 1\", \"type\": \"SLACK\" }, { \"id\": \"713\", \"name\": \"Channel 2\", \"type\": \"WEBHOOK\" }, // ... +198 more notification channels in reality ], \"nextCursor\": \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\", \"totalCount\": 268 } } } } } } Copy In your next request, provide the cursor like so, updating each subsequent request to return the updated cursor, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels(cursor: \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\") { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Find a specific notification channel by id If you have a specific notification channel's ID, the API allows you to look it up directly. Note that because the specific channel is a concrete type implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface, you may need to specify certain fields using the ... on syntax for inline fragments. In this example, we are retrieving a Slack channel: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannel(id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id name type ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } } } } } } Copy Create a notification channel In order to create an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to create (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Once a notification channel has been created, it can be associated with one or more alert policies. Once associated, those channels will receive notifications from those policies when conditions are violated. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only create a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Create an email notification channel An example create mutation for an email notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { emails: [\"email@example.com\"], includeJson: true, name: \"Some Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type config { emails includeJson } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an OpsGenie notification channel An example create mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { apiKey: \"api-key-from-opsgenie\", dataCenterRegion: US, name: \"OpsGenie notification channel name\", recipients: [\"user@example.com\"], tags: [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"], teams: [\"team1\", \"team2\"] } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey teams tags recipients dataCenterRegion } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a PagerDuty notification channel An example create mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty notification channel name\", apiKey: \"api-key-from-pagerduty\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Slack notification channel An example create mutation for a Slack notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack notification channel name\", teamChannel: \"#team-channel\", url: \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/FAKE/MOREFAKE/IMAGINARYEXAMPLEURLCHUNK\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type config { teamChannel url } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a VictorOps notification channel An example create mutation for a VictorOps notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { key: \"example-api-key-from-victorops\", name: \"VictorOps notification channel name\", routeKey:

{ password username } baseUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an xMatters notification channel An example create mutation for an xMatters notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { integrationUrl: \"https://company.instance.xmatters.com/api/xm/v<version>/...\", name: \"xMatters notification channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type config { integrationUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Update a notification channel In order to update an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to change (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Consistent with other GraphQL APIs, you can update a single field on the channel without knowing anything other than the channel's ID. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only update a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Update an email notification channel An example update mutation for an email notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { name: \"Updated Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an OpsGenie notification channel An example update mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { name: \"OpsGenie updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a PagerDuty notification channel An example update mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Slack notification channel An example update mutation for a Slack notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a VictorOps notification channel An example update mutation for a VictorOps notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { name: \"VictorOps updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Webhook notification channel An example update mutation for a Webhook notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { name: \"Webhook updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an xMatters notification channel An example update mutation for an xMatters notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { name: \"xMatters updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Delete a notification channel You can delete a notification channel with only the account ID and the channel ID. Note that deleting a channel dissociates it from all policies, meaning that no further notifications will be sent to that channel. mutation { alertsNotificationChannelDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Associate channels to a policy Creating an alert notification channel is not enough: Once the channel has been created, it needs to be associated to one or more policies. Once associated to a policy, the channel can recieve alert notifications when conditions on that policy go into violation. In this example, we associate two channels with a policy: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsAddToPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Dissociate a channel from a policy In those instances where a notification channel has outlived its usefulness (for example, an email list that has been retired), the time has come to dissociate that channel from the policy (or policies) that are sending alert notifications to it. This API call leaves the channel itself intact, but removes it from the specified policy. In this example, we are removing two channels from a policy (leaving any others in place), and getting back confirmation that those two channel IDs have been removed: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsRemoveFromPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Tip Removing an alert notification channel from a policy does not delete the policy because it might be used by other policies. On the other hand, deleting a channel will cause all associated channels to stop sending alert notifications to that channel.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add a new configuration option Step 1 of 8 In your visualization's nr1.json file, add an enum configuration object for selectedChart: index.js nr1.json 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 Radar: 'radar', 24 Treemap: 'treemap', 25 }; 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

Step 3 of 8 Serve your Nerdpack locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve If you're still serving your Nerdpack from the last lesson, you need to stop it with CTRL-X and serve it again to reflect changes to nr1.json. Step 4 of 8 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The nerdpacks=local query string directs the UI to load your visualization from the local server. Step 5 of 8 Open the Apps page: Step 6 of 8 Go to Custom Visualizations, which is favorited by default: Step 7 of 8 In Custom Visualizations, find and click your visualization: Step 8 of 8 Notice the new Select chart configuration option: Selecting a chart type doesn't effect your visualization. This is because you first need to introduce the selectedChart property to the visualization component. Then, you use selectedChart to determine the chart type to render. Replace your SegmentedControl with the configurable property Step 1 of 5 Open your visualization's index.js file. You'll be working here for the rest of the guide.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One Apps overlay. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

      "body": "This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model. Requirements Some notes on requirements: This tutorial is for users on our New Relic One user model. Creating access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we recommend you check out: Understand what an access grant is Videos that show the user management UI in action This tutorial will walk you through how to: Add users View available accounts Grant groups access to roles and accounts Create custom roles Add users to groups Add users Adding users to New Relic is a separate process from creating access grants. In other words, you can do either procedure first. The key point is that if you're trying to give a user access to a role or an account that they don't yet have, they won't have that access until they're both a) in a group and b) that group has the correct access grant (access to a specific role on a specific account). There are two ways to add users: With the user management UI (described below) With automated user management, also known as SCIM provisioning: use of this method means that groups are defined in your identity provider and so you can't edit a user's group from the New Relic UI. To add users from the UI: From the top right of the New Relic UI, click the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Relevant tips: For how to bulk edit users' user type, see Edit user type. When choosing a group, you can choose either one of our default groups or a custom group that you've defined an access grant for. For more on creating access grants, keep reading. View available accounts When thinking about creating access grants for granting access to different accounts, it can help you to understand what accounts there are in your organization. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant access to accounts and roles Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic: by creating an access grant, you assign a group access to a) a specific role on b) a specific account. By default, organizations on the New Relic One user model have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. To view existing access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. Even if you haven't created any custom access grants, you will see the default-created grants there that are present for our default groups. This is what you might see when you go to the Organization and access UI and view groups. The default available groups of Admin and User have access grants automatically created that grant users in those groups access to the roles associated with those groups and to the initial account those users were added in. To create a new access grant that gives a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're logged in with an original user model record, or because you don't have the ability to manage users. For more on such factors, see Factors affecting access. Choose one of the following: Existing: If there is already a group you want to add an access grant to, you can use this. For example, if you want to gives users in the default Admin or User group access to new accounts, you might choose this and then select the Admin Default or Admin User role. New: If you need to create a new group, choose this. You'll also need to choose the authentication domain that group is inside of (for an explanation of what \"Default\" means, see Default groups. If your organization strategy requires a good amount of restrictions over access to accounts and access to roles, you'll probably need to create a good amount of access grants. Next, under Access grant, you'll choose one of following: Account: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are account-scoped. These are the roles that have to do with using and configuring our platform features (and not about organization and user management). Organization: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are organization-scoped. These are the roles that govern organization- and user management. (Note that these users must also already belong to an account-scoped role. This is true for most users but if it's not, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Select the Role you want to assign. Roles are organization-wide, so regardless of the authentication domain you're in, you have access to our standard roles and any custom roles you've created. For tips on selecting roles, see the tips after these instructions. Select the Account you want to add access to from the dropdown. If you don't see an account that you'd expect to see, this may be for a few reasons. One is that you yourself don't have the proper permissions for that account. Another is that that account is not actually in your organization. For more information, see Factors affecting access. If you are still having problems, talk to your account representative. If you want to continue adding more grants for that same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. When you're done, if your users are already in the group you've added the grant to, they should have access within a few minutes (although for EU region New Relic accounts, this can take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true if you just created an access grant with a new group), you'll need to go to the User management UI and add that group to those users. Some tips for using this UI: Note that if a user has the organization-scoped Organization manager and/or Authentication domain manager roles, which is true of users in the default Admin group, those users will always have those capabilities because those are organization-scoped abilities. This means that when you go to add those users to another account, you only have to add an account-scoped role, and not an organization-scoped role. In other words, once the users in a group have those organization-scoped roles, they will always have them in that organization unless removed. When selecting from amongst our standard roles, it's important to understand the difference between All product admin and Standard user. In short, All product admin is more popular a choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure them, you'd choose Standard user. If your users are managed via automated user management, there are some restrictions that may apply. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the User management UI to add users to groups, because groups are managed and imported from your identity provider. If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. Create custom role When creating an access grant, you can use our standard roles, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Review the list of available capabilities and decide which ones your custom role needs. For more information about how roles and capabilities work, see Capabilities. Once you're finished creating a custom role, you will probably want to use it in a new access grant. Add users to groups In the user management UI, you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to. Your users only have access to the access grants associated with the groups they've been added to. To view users and see their groups: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

      "body": "For accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan, we provide a View your usage UI for understanding billing-related usage and a Manage your data UI for managing billing-related data. Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are four options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, IncidentIntelligence, or ProactiveDetection. For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost. This is an estimate of costs to date, not your monthly invoice. For more attributes, see the data dictionary.",

      "body": "For users on our New Relic One user model, we provide various user management features, including the ability to: Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to user groups Create custom user groups Grant user groups access to specific roles and accounts Important This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic user versus full user) Note that there are limits around how many times full users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: allows you to configure your Nerdlet and write to your Nerdlet's URL state.",

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

      "body": "This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model. Requirements Some notes on requirements: This tutorial is for users on our New Relic One user model. Creating access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we recommend you check out: Understand what an access grant is Videos that show the user management UI in action This tutorial will walk you through how to: Add users View available accounts Grant groups access to roles and accounts Create custom roles Add users to groups Add users Adding users to New Relic is a separate process from creating access grants. In other words, you can do either procedure first. The key point is that if you're trying to give a user access to a role or an account that they don't yet have, they won't have that access until they're both a) in a group and b) that group has the correct access grant (access to a specific role on a specific account). There are two ways to add users: With the user management UI (described below) With automated user management, also known as SCIM provisioning: use of this method means that groups are defined in your identity provider and so you can't edit a user's group from the New Relic UI. To add users from the UI: From the top right of the New Relic UI, click the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Relevant tips: For how to bulk edit users' user type, see Edit user type. When choosing a group, you can choose either one of our default groups or a custom group that you've defined an access grant for. For more on creating access grants, keep reading. View available accounts When thinking about creating access grants for granting access to different accounts, it can help you to understand what accounts there are in your organization. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant access to accounts and roles Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic: by creating an access grant, you assign a group access to a) a specific role on b) a specific account. By default, organizations on the New Relic One user model have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. To view existing access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. Even if you haven't created any custom access grants, you will see the default-created grants there that are present for our default groups. This is what you might see when you go to the Organization and access UI and view groups. The default available groups of Admin and User have access grants automatically created that grant users in those groups access to the roles associated with those groups and to the initial account those users were added in. To create a new access grant that gives a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're logged in with an original user model record, or because you don't have the ability to manage users. For more on such factors, see Factors affecting access. Choose one of the following: Existing: If there is already a group you want to add an access grant to, you can use this. For example, if you want to gives users in the default Admin or User group access to new accounts, you might choose this and then select the Admin Default or Admin User role. New: If you need to create a new group, choose this. You'll also need to choose the authentication domain that group is inside of (for an explanation of what \"Default\" means, see Default groups. If your organization strategy requires a good amount of restrictions over access to accounts and access to roles, you'll probably need to create a good amount of access grants. Next, under Access grant, you'll choose one of following: Account: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are account-scoped. These are the roles that have to do with using and configuring our platform features (and not about organization and user management). Organization: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are organization-scoped. These are the roles that govern organization- and user management. (Note that these users must also already belong to an account-scoped role. This is true for most users but if it's not, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Select the Role you want to assign. Roles are organization-wide, so regardless of the authentication domain you're in, you have access to our standard roles and any custom roles you've created. For tips on selecting roles, see the tips after these instructions. Select the Account you want to add access to from the dropdown. If you don't see an account that you'd expect to see, this may be for a few reasons. One is that you yourself don't have the proper permissions for that account. Another is that that account is not actually in your organization. For more information, see Factors affecting access. If you are still having problems, talk to your account representative. If you want to continue adding more grants for that same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. When you're done, if your users are already in the group you've added the grant to, they should have access within a few minutes (although for EU region New Relic accounts, this can take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true if you just created an access grant with a new group), you'll need to go to the User management UI and add that group to those users. Some tips for using this UI: Note that if a user has the organization-scoped Organization manager and/or Authentication domain manager roles, which is true of users in the default Admin group, those users will always have those capabilities because those are organization-scoped abilities. This means that when you go to add those users to another account, you only have to add an account-scoped role, and not an organization-scoped role. In other words, once the users in a group have those organization-scoped roles, they will always have them in that organization unless removed. When selecting from amongst our standard roles, it's important to understand the difference between All product admin and Standard user. In short, All product admin is more popular a choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure them, you'd choose Standard user. If your users are managed via automated user management, there are some restrictions that may apply. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the User management UI to add users to groups, because groups are managed and imported from your identity provider. If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. Create custom role When creating an access grant, you can use our standard roles, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Review the list of available capabilities and decide which ones your custom role needs. For more information about how roles and capabilities work, see Capabilities. Once you're finished creating a custom role, you will probably want to use it in a new access grant. Add users to groups In the user management UI, you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to. Your users only have access to the access grants associated with the groups they've been added to. To view users and see their groups: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time.

This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users.

Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are four options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, IncidentIntelligence, or ProactiveDetection. For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost. This is an estimate of costs to date, not your monthly invoice. For more attributes, see the data dictionary.",

      "body": "For users on our New Relic One user model, we provide various user management features, including the ability to: Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to user groups Create custom user groups Grant user groups access to specific roles and accounts Important This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic user versus full user) Note that there are limits around how many times full users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github.

Step 5 of 8 Open the Apps page: Step 6 of 8 Go to Custom Visualizations, which is favorited by default: Step 7 of 8 In Custom Visualizations, find and click your visualization: Step 8 of 8 Notice the new Select chart configuration option: Selecting a chart type doesn't effect your visualization. This is because you first need to introduce the selectedChart property to the visualization component. Then, you use selectedChart to determine the chart type to render. Replace your SegmentedControl with the configurable property Step 1 of 5 Open your visualization's index.js file. You'll be working here for the rest of the guide. Step 2 of 5 In render(), include selectedChart as a constant you get from destructuring props, and remove your component's state: index.js nr1.json 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 Radar: 'radar', 24 Treemap: 'treemap', 25 }; 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

      "body": "This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model. Requirements Some notes on requirements: This tutorial is for users on our New Relic One user model. Creating access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we recommend you check out: Understand what an access grant is Videos that show the user management UI in action This tutorial will walk you through how to: Add users View available accounts Grant groups access to roles and accounts Create custom roles Add users to groups Add users Adding users to New Relic is a separate process from creating access grants. In other words, you can do either procedure first. The key point is that if you're trying to give a user access to a role or an account that they don't yet have, they won't have that access until they're both a) in a group and b) that group has the correct access grant (access to a specific role on a specific account). There are two ways to add users: With the user management UI (described below) With automated user management, also known as SCIM provisioning: use of this method means that groups are defined in your identity provider and so you can't edit a user's group from the New Relic UI. To add users from the UI: From the top right of the New Relic UI, click the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Relevant tips: For how to bulk edit users' user type, see Edit user type. When choosing a group, you can choose either one of our default groups or a custom group that you've defined an access grant for. For more on creating access grants, keep reading. View available accounts When thinking about creating access grants for granting access to different accounts, it can help you to understand what accounts there are in your organization. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant access to accounts and roles Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic: by creating an access grant, you assign a group access to a) a specific role on b) a specific account. By default, organizations on the New Relic One user model have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. To view existing access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. Even if you haven't created any custom access grants, you will see the default-created grants there that are present for our default groups. This is what you might see when you go to the Organization and access UI and view groups. The default available groups of Admin and User have access grants automatically created that grant users in those groups access to the roles associated with those groups and to the initial account those users were added in. To create a new access grant that gives a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're logged in with an original user model record, or because you don't have the ability to manage users. For more on such factors, see Factors affecting access. Choose one of the following: Existing: If there is already a group you want to add an access grant to, you can use this. For example, if you want to gives users in the default Admin or User group access to new accounts, you might choose this and then select the Admin Default or Admin User role. New: If you need to create a new group, choose this. You'll also need to choose the authentication domain that group is inside of (for an explanation of what \"Default\" means, see Default groups. If your organization strategy requires a good amount of restrictions over access to accounts and access to roles, you'll probably need to create a good amount of access grants. Next, under Access grant, you'll choose one of following: Account: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are account-scoped. These are the roles that have to do with using and configuring our platform features (and not about organization and user management). Organization: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are organization-scoped. These are the roles that govern organization- and user management. (Note that these users must also already belong to an account-scoped role. This is true for most users but if it's not, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Select the Role you want to assign. Roles are organization-wide, so regardless of the authentication domain you're in, you have access to our standard roles and any custom roles you've created. For tips on selecting roles, see the tips after these instructions. Select the Account you want to add access to from the dropdown. If you don't see an account that you'd expect to see, this may be for a few reasons. One is that you yourself don't have the proper permissions for that account. Another is that that account is not actually in your organization. For more information, see Factors affecting access. If you are still having problems, talk to your account representative. If you want to continue adding more grants for that same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. When you're done, if your users are already in the group you've added the grant to, they should have access within a few minutes (although for EU region New Relic accounts, this can take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true if you just created an access grant with a new group), you'll need to go to the User management UI and add that group to those users. Some tips for using this UI: Note that if a user has the organization-scoped Organization manager and/or Authentication domain manager roles, which is true of users in the default Admin group, those users will always have those capabilities because those are organization-scoped abilities. This means that when you go to add those users to another account, you only have to add an account-scoped role, and not an organization-scoped role. In other words, once the users in a group have those organization-scoped roles, they will always have them in that organization unless removed. When selecting from amongst our standard roles, it's important to understand the difference between All product admin and Standard user. In short, All product admin is more popular a choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure them, you'd choose Standard user. If your users are managed via automated user management, there are some restrictions that may apply. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the User management UI to add users to groups, because groups are managed and imported from your identity provider. If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. Create custom role When creating an access grant, you can use our standard roles, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Review the list of available capabilities and decide which ones your custom role needs. For more information about how roles and capabilities work, see Capabilities. Once you're finished creating a custom role, you will probably want to use it in a new access grant. Add users to groups In the user management UI, you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to. Your users only have access to the access grants associated with the groups they've been added to. To view users and see their groups: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are four options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, IncidentIntelligence, or ProactiveDetection. For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost.

For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic user versus full user) Note that there are limits around how many times full users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Tip Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

      "info": "Add a table to your New Relic One app.",
      "body": "Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account and Node.js installed on your machine. See Setting up your development environment for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git $ cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application. Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID $ npm install # Install dependencies $ nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, you should see a Create a table launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet subdirectory and open the index.js file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component. Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows. As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells. The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done!

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

      "body": "This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model. Requirements Some notes on requirements: This tutorial is for users on our New Relic One user model. Creating access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we recommend you check out: Understand what an access grant is Videos that show the user management UI in action This tutorial will walk you through how to: Add users View available accounts Grant groups access to roles and accounts Create custom roles Add users to groups Add users Adding users to New Relic is a separate process from creating access grants. In other words, you can do either procedure first. The key point is that if you're trying to give a user access to a role or an account that they don't yet have, they won't have that access until they're both a) in a group and b) that group has the correct access grant (access to a specific role on a specific account). There are two ways to add users: With the user management UI (described below) With automated user management, also known as SCIM provisioning: use of this method means that groups are defined in your identity provider and so you can't edit a user's group from the New Relic UI. To add users from the UI: From the top right of the New Relic UI, click the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Relevant tips: For how to bulk edit users' user type, see Edit user type. When choosing a group, you can choose either one of our default groups or a custom group that you've defined an access grant for. For more on creating access grants, keep reading. View available accounts When thinking about creating access grants for granting access to different accounts, it can help you to understand what accounts there are in your organization. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant access to accounts and roles Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic: by creating an access grant, you assign a group access to a) a specific role on b) a specific account. By default, organizations on the New Relic One user model have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. To view existing access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. Even if you haven't created any custom access grants, you will see the default-created grants there that are present for our default groups. This is what you might see when you go to the Organization and access UI and view groups. The default available groups of Admin and User have access grants automatically created that grant users in those groups access to the roles associated with those groups and to the initial account those users were added in. To create a new access grant that gives a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're logged in with an original user model record, or because you don't have the ability to manage users. For more on such factors, see Factors affecting access. Choose one of the following: Existing: If there is already a group you want to add an access grant to, you can use this. For example, if you want to gives users in the default Admin or User group access to new accounts, you might choose this and then select the Admin Default or Admin User role. New: If you need to create a new group, choose this. You'll also need to choose the authentication domain that group is inside of (for an explanation of what \"Default\" means, see Default groups. If your organization strategy requires a good amount of restrictions over access to accounts and access to roles, you'll probably need to create a good amount of access grants. Next, under Access grant, you'll choose one of following: Account: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are account-scoped. These are the roles that have to do with using and configuring our platform features (and not about organization and user management). Organization: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are organization-scoped. These are the roles that govern organization- and user management. (Note that these users must also already belong to an account-scoped role. This is true for most users but if it's not, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Select the Role you want to assign. Roles are organization-wide, so regardless of the authentication domain you're in, you have access to our standard roles and any custom roles you've created. For tips on selecting roles, see the tips after these instructions. Select the Account you want to add access to from the dropdown. If you don't see an account that you'd expect to see, this may be for a few reasons. One is that you yourself don't have the proper permissions for that account. Another is that that account is not actually in your organization. For more information, see Factors affecting access. If you are still having problems, talk to your account representative. If you want to continue adding more grants for that same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. When you're done, if your users are already in the group you've added the grant to, they should have access within a few minutes (although for EU region New Relic accounts, this can take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true if you just created an access grant with a new group), you'll need to go to the User management UI and add that group to those users. Some tips for using this UI: Note that if a user has the organization-scoped Organization manager and/or Authentication domain manager roles, which is true of users in the default Admin group, those users will always have those capabilities because those are organization-scoped abilities. This means that when you go to add those users to another account, you only have to add an account-scoped role, and not an organization-scoped role. In other words, once the users in a group have those organization-scoped roles, they will always have them in that organization unless removed. When selecting from amongst our standard roles, it's important to understand the difference between All product admin and Standard user. In short, All product admin is more popular a choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure them, you'd choose Standard user. If your users are managed via automated user management, there are some restrictions that may apply. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the User management UI to add users to groups, because groups are managed and imported from your identity provider. If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. Create custom role When creating an access grant, you can use our standard roles, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Review the list of available capabilities and decide which ones your custom role needs. For more information about how roles and capabilities work, see Capabilities. Once you're finished creating a custom role, you will probably want to use it in a new access grant. Add users to groups In the user management UI, you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to. Your users only have access to the access grants associated with the groups they've been added to. To view users and see their groups: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are four options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, IncidentIntelligence, or ProactiveDetection. For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost. This is an estimate of costs to date, not your monthly invoice. For more attributes, see the data dictionary.",

      "body": "For users on our New Relic One user model, we provide various user management features, including the ability to: Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to user groups Create custom user groups Grant user groups access to specific roles and accounts Important This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic user versus full user) Note that there are limits around how many times full users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github.

Step 5 of 8 Open the Apps page: Step 6 of 8 Go to Custom Visualizations, which is favorited by default: Step 7 of 8 In Custom Visualizations, find and click your visualization: Step 8 of 8 Notice the new Select chart configuration option: Selecting a chart type doesn't effect your visualization. This is because you first need to introduce the selectedChart property to the visualization component. Then, you use selectedChart to determine the chart type to render. Replace your SegmentedControl with the configurable property Step 1 of 5 Open your visualization's index.js file. You'll be working here for the rest of the guide. Step 2 of 5 In render(), include selectedChart as a constant you get from destructuring props, and remove your component's state: index.js nr1.json 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 Radar: 'radar', 24 Treemap: 'treemap', 25 }; 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

      "body": "Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the entity. An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic. This document explains: What entities are How to find entity data How entities are related to one another How to organize them into groups for easier analysis What is an entity? From a New Relic product perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. \"Entity\" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. This conceptual definition of \"entity\" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities You'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic. Tip You can create new entity types to monitor any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, hover over a specific entity and click the icon to see the GUID and other metadata. An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the query builder. Use the Related Entities view in the New Relic Explorer, service maps, distributed tracing, and our relationships API in GraphQL to see connections between entities. Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (api.newrelic.com/graphiql). Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a single entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related Entities in the entity's mini overview. Related Entities is a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity in focus. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip You can learn more about how entities are related using our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related Entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. These are granted to user roles by default. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: How to tag entities Create workloads (groups of related entities)",

      "body": "To view workloads, go to one.newrelic.com and find them on the Explorer. There are two main tabs, Health and Activity, plus the header. The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here's the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. Finally, the header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload.

Forever. What is a workload in New Relic? New Relic monitors a wide range of entities and data, from client-side applications and backend APIs, to the underlying infrastructure. To make sense of this large data set, we give you the ability to create and monitor workloads. Workloads give you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, and provide an aggregated view of the health and activity of the entities in the workload. Thus, you can understand better how your business logic is working, from frontend to backend services, across your entire stack. Here are some workload examples: A serverless application that includes an API gateway, a few serverless functions, and a managed database and storage. A browser application and the backend APIs that support it. A collection of Java microservices and the infrastructure they run on. Here's a workload: one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > (selected workload): The workloads UI provides a curated view of how the entities in your workload are performing. The charts you see will depend on the types of entities you've included to the workload. Tip Learn how to use workloads. Why it matters Workloads give you visibility into the end-to-end availability and consumption of resources across an entire service, and provide you a way to define what’s relevant to you. You can use workloads to group together entities that are important to a specific team or project, so you can better browse and isolate the most relevant data for that service. Because our UI gives you cross-account access, you can add entities to your workload from any of the accounts you have access to. A workload can include: Any New Relic-monitored entity, including services, browser apps, mobile apps, databases, and hosts. Dashboards. Other workloads: this is useful for complex teams who need to divide and overlap workloads. Requirements Requirements for creating and managing workloads: All users for an account can view that account's workloads. To create, edit, and delete workloads, you must have a user role with that permission. Impact of accounts on the workload permissions and content Workloads can group and display entities from multiple accounts to provide complete observability of complex systems. When creating a workload, you must set: The workload account Scope accounts Learn how to find a New Relic account ID. Workload account The workload account is where any workload-specific data is stored. For example, a workload might generate NrAuditEvent data, and you would find that data by querying the workload account. The workload account determines the user permissions that govern which users can see and manage the workload, through the account roles. Once created, the workload account can’t be changed. Scope accounts Scope accounts are the accounts from which a workload fetches entity data. In other words, the scope accounts provide the content for a workload. Users who don’t have access to all of a workload's scope accounts may not be able to see complete workload data. Scope accounts can be updated at any point in time by any user with workload management capabilities on the workload account. By default, all accounts that the workload creator has access to at the moment of the workload creation are set as scope accounts.",

      "body": "This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model. Requirements Some notes on requirements: This tutorial is for users on our New Relic One user model. Creating access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we recommend you check out: Understand what an access grant is Videos that show the user management UI in action This tutorial will walk you through how to: Add users View available accounts Grant groups access to roles and accounts Create custom roles Add users to groups Add users Adding users to New Relic is a separate process from creating access grants. In other words, you can do either procedure first. The key point is that if you're trying to give a user access to a role or an account that they don't yet have, they won't have that access until they're both a) in a group and b) that group has the correct access grant (access to a specific role on a specific account). There are two ways to add users: With the user management UI (described below) With automated user management, also known as SCIM provisioning: use of this method means that groups are defined in your identity provider and so you can't edit a user's group from the New Relic UI. To add users from the UI: From the top right of the New Relic UI, click the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Relevant tips: For how to bulk edit users' user type, see Edit user type. When choosing a group, you can choose either one of our default groups or a custom group that you've defined an access grant for. For more on creating access grants, keep reading. View available accounts When thinking about creating access grants for granting access to different accounts, it can help you to understand what accounts there are in your organization. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant access to accounts and roles Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic: by creating an access grant, you assign a group access to a) a specific role on b) a specific account. By default, organizations on the New Relic One user model have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. To view existing access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. Even if you haven't created any custom access grants, you will see the default-created grants there that are present for our default groups. This is what you might see when you go to the Organization and access UI and view groups. The default available groups of Admin and User have access grants automatically created that grant users in those groups access to the roles associated with those groups and to the initial account those users were added in. To create a new access grant that gives a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're logged in with an original user model record, or because you don't have the ability to manage users. For more on such factors, see Factors affecting access. Choose one of the following: Existing: If there is already a group you want to add an access grant to, you can use this. For example, if you want to gives users in the default Admin or User group access to new accounts, you might choose this and then select the Admin Default or Admin User role. New: If you need to create a new group, choose this. You'll also need to choose the authentication domain that group is inside of (for an explanation of what \"Default\" means, see Default groups. If your organization strategy requires a good amount of restrictions over access to accounts and access to roles, you'll probably need to create a good amount of access grants. Next, under Access grant, you'll choose one of following: Account: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are account-scoped. These are the roles that have to do with using and configuring our platform features (and not about organization and user management). Organization: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are organization-scoped. These are the roles that govern organization- and user management. (Note that these users must also already belong to an account-scoped role. This is true for most users but if it's not, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Select the Role you want to assign. Roles are organization-wide, so regardless of the authentication domain you're in, you have access to our standard roles and any custom roles you've created. For tips on selecting roles, see the tips after these instructions. Select the Account you want to add access to from the dropdown. If you don't see an account that you'd expect to see, this may be for a few reasons. One is that you yourself don't have the proper permissions for that account. Another is that that account is not actually in your organization. For more information, see Factors affecting access. If you are still having problems, talk to your account representative. If you want to continue adding more grants for that same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. When you're done, if your users are already in the group you've added the grant to, they should have access within a few minutes (although for EU region New Relic accounts, this can take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true if you just created an access grant with a new group), you'll need to go to the User management UI and add that group to those users. Some tips for using this UI: Note that if a user has the organization-scoped Organization manager and/or Authentication domain manager roles, which is true of users in the default Admin group, those users will always have those capabilities because those are organization-scoped abilities. This means that when you go to add those users to another account, you only have to add an account-scoped role, and not an organization-scoped role. In other words, once the users in a group have those organization-scoped roles, they will always have them in that organization unless removed. When selecting from amongst our standard roles, it's important to understand the difference between All product admin and Standard user. In short, All product admin is more popular a choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure them, you'd choose Standard user. If your users are managed via automated user management, there are some restrictions that may apply. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the User management UI to add users to groups, because groups are managed and imported from your identity provider. If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. Create custom role When creating an access grant, you can use our standard roles, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Review the list of available capabilities and decide which ones your custom role needs. For more information about how roles and capabilities work, see Capabilities. Once you're finished creating a custom role, you will probably want to use it in a new access grant. Add users to groups In the user management UI, you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to. Your users only have access to the access grants associated with the groups they've been added to. To view users and see their groups: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are four options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, IncidentIntelligence, or ProactiveDetection. For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost.

For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic user versus full user) Note that there are limits around how many times full users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add a new configuration option Step 1 of 8 In your visualization's nr1.json file, add an enum configuration object for selectedChart: index.js nr1.json 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 Radar: 'radar', 24 Treemap: 'treemap', 25 }; 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

Step 3 of 8 Serve your Nerdpack locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve If you're still serving your Nerdpack from the last lesson, you need to stop it with CTRL-X and serve it again to reflect changes to nr1.json. Step 4 of 8 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The nerdpacks=local query string directs the UI to load your visualization from the local server. Step 5 of 8 Open the Apps page: Step 6 of 8 Go to Custom Visualizations, which is favorited by default: Step 7 of 8 In Custom Visualizations, find and click your visualization: Step 8 of 8 Notice the new Select chart configuration option: Selecting a chart type doesn't effect your visualization. This is because you first need to introduce the selectedChart property to the visualization component. Then, you use selectedChart to determine the chart type to render. Replace your SegmentedControl with the configurable property Step 1 of 5 Open your visualization's index.js file. You'll be working here for the rest of the guide.

      "body": "This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model. Requirements Some notes on requirements: This tutorial is for users on our New Relic One user model. Creating access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we recommend you check out: Understand what an access grant is Videos that show the user management UI in action This tutorial will walk you through how to: Add users View available accounts Grant groups access to roles and accounts Create custom roles Add users to groups Add users Adding users to New Relic is a separate process from creating access grants. In other words, you can do either procedure first. The key point is that if you're trying to give a user access to a role or an account that they don't yet have, they won't have that access until they're both a) in a group and b) that group has the correct access grant (access to a specific role on a specific account). There are two ways to add users: With the user management UI (described below) With automated user management, also known as SCIM provisioning: use of this method means that groups are defined in your identity provider and so you can't edit a user's group from the New Relic UI. To add users from the UI: From the top right of the New Relic UI, click the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Relevant tips: For how to bulk edit users' user type, see Edit user type. When choosing a group, you can choose either one of our default groups or a custom group that you've defined an access grant for. For more on creating access grants, keep reading. View available accounts When thinking about creating access grants for granting access to different accounts, it can help you to understand what accounts there are in your organization. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant access to accounts and roles Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic: by creating an access grant, you assign a group access to a) a specific role on b) a specific account. By default, organizations on the New Relic One user model have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. To view existing access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. Even if you haven't created any custom access grants, you will see the default-created grants there that are present for our default groups. This is what you might see when you go to the Organization and access UI and view groups. The default available groups of Admin and User have access grants automatically created that grant users in those groups access to the roles associated with those groups and to the initial account those users were added in. To create a new access grant that gives a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're logged in with an original user model record, or because you don't have the ability to manage users. For more on such factors, see Factors affecting access. Choose one of the following: Existing: If there is already a group you want to add an access grant to, you can use this. For example, if you want to gives users in the default Admin or User group access to new accounts, you might choose this and then select the Admin Default or Admin User role. New: If you need to create a new group, choose this. You'll also need to choose the authentication domain that group is inside of (for an explanation of what \"Default\" means, see Default groups. If your organization strategy requires a good amount of restrictions over access to accounts and access to roles, you'll probably need to create a good amount of access grants. Next, under Access grant, you'll choose one of following: Account: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are account-scoped. These are the roles that have to do with using and configuring our platform features (and not about organization and user management). Organization: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are organization-scoped. These are the roles that govern organization- and user management. (Note that these users must also already belong to an account-scoped role. This is true for most users but if it's not, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Select the Role you want to assign. Roles are organization-wide, so regardless of the authentication domain you're in, you have access to our standard roles and any custom roles you've created. For tips on selecting roles, see the tips after these instructions. Select the Account you want to add access to from the dropdown. If you don't see an account that you'd expect to see, this may be for a few reasons. One is that you yourself don't have the proper permissions for that account. Another is that that account is not actually in your organization. For more information, see Factors affecting access. If you are still having problems, talk to your account representative. If you want to continue adding more grants for that same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. When you're done, if your users are already in the group you've added the grant to, they should have access within a few minutes (although for EU region New Relic accounts, this can take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true if you just created an access grant with a new group), you'll need to go to the User management UI and add that group to those users. Some tips for using this UI: Note that if a user has the organization-scoped Organization manager and/or Authentication domain manager roles, which is true of users in the default Admin group, those users will always have those capabilities because those are organization-scoped abilities. This means that when you go to add those users to another account, you only have to add an account-scoped role, and not an organization-scoped role. In other words, once the users in a group have those organization-scoped roles, they will always have them in that organization unless removed. When selecting from amongst our standard roles, it's important to understand the difference between All product admin and Standard user. In short, All product admin is more popular a choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure them, you'd choose Standard user. If your users are managed via automated user management, there are some restrictions that may apply. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the User management UI to add users to groups, because groups are managed and imported from your identity provider. If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. Create custom role When creating an access grant, you can use our standard roles, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Review the list of available capabilities and decide which ones your custom role needs. For more information about how roles and capabilities work, see Capabilities. Once you're finished creating a custom role, you will probably want to use it in a new access grant. Add users to groups In the user management UI, you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to. Your users only have access to the access grants associated with the groups they've been added to. To view users and see their groups: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now.

This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events.

      "body": "For users on our New Relic One user model, we provide various user management features, including the ability to: Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to user groups Create custom user groups Grant user groups access to specific roles and accounts Important This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic user versus full user) Note that there are limits around how many times full users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github.

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020 and haven't migrated your users to the new model, your users are on our original user model (and not the New Relic One model). If you're an admin and want to see if you have users on the original model: If you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Updates about our new user model In July of 2020, we released a new user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more older customers to the new model. Some older customers are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this: Click the account dropdown, click Account settings, and then click Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) and full user upgrades Note that billing-related aspects of your count of full users only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. To control how basic users upgrade to become full users, from the Users and roles UI you can select Access requests. You have two options: Automatic approval: With this option, basic users can automatically upgrade to be full users. This option allows your users to more easily troubleshoot problems. Require review: With this option, your admins get a notification when basic users request an upgrade and must upgrade them first. You can approve them either from the notification email or from the user's entry in the Users and roles UI. For more about user type, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Depending on access request settings, basic users can either upgrade themselves to be full users or request upgrade access from admins. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user is considered a full user and has full user access on all accounts in that organization. For how to edit a user's type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of user permissions. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads.

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core. This document describes compatibility and support for .NET Core applications. See Compatibility and requirements for .NET Framework for .NET Framework applications. New Relic's .NET agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET Core ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After installation, the agent runs within the monitored process; there is not a separate process or service created by the agent. For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Want to try out our .NET agent? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements Before you install the New Relic .NET agent on Windows or Linux, make sure your system meets these requirements: Microsoft .NET Core version The .NET agent supports .NET Core versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and .NET 5.0. Table of minimum agent versions required per .NET Core version .NET Core Version Minimum Required .NET Agent Version .NET Core 2.0 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.1 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.2 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 3.0 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET Core 3.1 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET 5.0 > = 8.35.0 The agent is not compatible with .NET Core versions 1.0 or 1.1. For .NET Core 2.1 or higher applications with tiered compilation enabled, the agent will disable tiered compilation. .NET Core 2.1 support requires .NET Core runtime 2.1.3 and .NET Core SDK 2.1.401 or higher due to a bug in the .NET Core profiling API. Target framework version The .NET agent only supports applications targeting .NET Core 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and NET 5.0. You can find the target framework in your .csproj file: Supported: <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework> Copy Unsupported: <TargetFramework>net452</TargetFramework> Copy Important If you want to monitor an ASP.NET Core application targeting .NET Framework, ensure your install of the .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. App/web servers Ensure you use one of these app/web servers: Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 Kestrel with Nginx reverse proxy Kestrel with Apache reverse proxy Operating system The agent has been verified to work with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported versions Windows (32- and 64-bit Intel compatible architectures) Server 2008 R2 SP1 Server 2012 Server 2012 R2 Server 2016 Server 2019 Windows containers running on Server 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Linux (64-bit Intel compatible only) All x64 Linux distributions supported by the .NET Core 2.0+/.NET 5 runtime are supported by the .NET agent. For a full list, refer to Microsoft's documentation for the version of the runtime you are using. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions on Windows as well as 64-bit (x64) on Linux. Permissions Installing and running the .NET agent requires these permissions: Component Necessary permissions Install the agent The process or user that installs the agent must have sufficient permissions to set environment variables and write access to the directory where the agent is installed. Run the agent The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which you installed the agent. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. For applications using IIS via reverse proxy, the group IIS_IUSRS is often used. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET Core, the agent automatically creates and instruments transactions. The .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. App frameworks The .NET agent automatically instruments these application frameworks: ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and 5.0 (includes Web API) Datastores The .NET agent automatically instruments the performance of .NET application calls to these datastores: Datastore Instance details Notes Microsoft SQL Server Use System.Data.SqlClient version 4.3.1 or Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. PostgresSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. MongoDB Driver version 2.3.x - 2.13.x: The .NET agent will support instrumenting pre-exising and new API methods in 2.6.x, but not new methods introduced in 2.7.x and higher. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4 or later, or use the MySQL Connector StackExchange.Redis The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collecting instance details for supported datastores is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. External call libraries The .NET agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: RabbitMQ 5.1.0 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. The following methods are instrumented: IModel.BasicGet IModel.BasicPublish IModel.BasicComsume IModel.QueuePurge EventingBasicConsumer.HandleBasicDeliver Unavailable features The following features are not available for the .NET agent: Memory usage on Linux due to an ongoing .NET Core issue (try using .NET performance metrics to get this information) Automatic brower monitoring script injection (API or manual instrumentation is required) The .NET agent does not support trim self-contained deployments and executables, because the compiler can potentially trim assemblies that the agent depends on. Infinite Tracing is not supported on Alpine Linux due to a GRPC compatibility issue. See this agent issue for more information. Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the .NET agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The browser monitoring JavaScript agent will not be injected by the .NET agent for ASP.NET core applications. However, you can inject the browser agent by using the .NET agent API or the browser agent's copy/paste method. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Dashboards The .NET agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis.",

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. You also need a New Relic account. Sign up for free. No credit card required. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. macOS (Beta): 64-bit x86 processor (M1 processor is not supported yet). Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.16 to 1.22 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher Oracle Linux Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 15, 15.1, 15.2, 15.3 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Interim releases 20.10, 21.04. Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 and their service packs. macOS macOS 10.14 (Mohave), 10.15 (Catalina), 11 (Big Sur). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. macOS: The agent can be installed from any user account. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). If the name begins with anything other than an alphabetical character, enclose the name with backticks in your NRQL query. For example: FROM `0_hello` SELECT count(*) Copy Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period.

      "body": "Use our New Relic query language (NRQL) to create alerts conditions with ease. Your condition describes what you want to be notified about, and only requires two attributes: a query and a threshold. The query defines the data that's important to you, and determines what you want to be notified about. The threshold determines when you’ll be notified. Follow these steps to write your first alerts condition using a NRQL query and a threshold. Once you're done, you'll have a working alert condition. Step 1: Write your query You can use a NRQL query to return data about how your environment is performing. Then, you can create a condition from that query. In this example, a condition is created for each host's CPU utilization (query), which will trigger a notification when the CPU utilization is above the 0.7% (threshold). Generally, you won't use thresholds below 1%, but this example simply shows you how to set up a threshold. Find the NRQL query builder at the top of the UI. Click the Query your data button to open the query builder and start writing a NRQL query. Once you've written a valid query, you can create a condition from it. The condition shows each host’s CPU utilization. Use this NRQL query, or something similar that's relevant to what you're monitoring, to create a condition. This query finds the average CPU utilization in an environment and then breaks it down (facets) by individual host names. Once you've created a valid NRQL query, click Create alert. Learn more about the NRQL syntax to create other useful queries. Step 2: Name your NRQL condition Give your NRQL condition a name that's meaningful to you. Step 3: Set your condition thresholds Set critical and warning thresholds to determine when you’re notified about your environment's performance. A critical threshold is required for your alerts condition. A warning threshold is optional. These thresholds don't create an incident or notify you like the critical threshold does. If a critical threshold opens an incident and notifies you, warning threshold violations created afterwards will be included in the report. In this example from the Set your condition thresholds section, our critical threshold (red) checks for any hosts with CPU utilization over 0.7% for at least 5 minutes. A warning threshold (yellow) is also added showing when any host's CPU utilization goes over 0.67% for at least 5 minutes. After you enter threshold values, you can see the threshold lines on the graph: Step 4: Create a policy Finally, add your condition to an existing policy or create a new one. When you create a new policy, you can group your violations by policy, condition, or by violation (this creates an incident for each violation). These incident preferences settings determine how frequently you're notified when there's a violation. What's next? Now that you've created your first condition, set up your incident preferences and notification channels. For a detailed, comprehensive overview of NRQL conditions, see Create NRQL alert conditions",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier condition types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL conditions produce a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL conditions, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation duration window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple aggregation functions Each condition can only target a single aggregated value. To alert on multiple values simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline condition types. The outlier condition type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy NRQL conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window duration is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period NRQL conditions evaluate data based on how it's aggregated, using aggregation windows from 15 seconds to 15 minutes, in increments of 15 seconds. For best results, we recommend using the event flow or event timer aggregation methods. For the cadence aggregation method, the implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your delay/timer setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window duration, the delay/timer, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert condition types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of conditions: NRQL alert condition types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL condition. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) condition types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. Note that when you have a faceted query, each facet is a signal. So if any one of those signals ends during the duration specified, that will be considered a loss of signal. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, use the advanced signal settings to control streaming alert data and avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window duration Delay/timer Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window duration You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between 15 seconds and 15 minutes, in 15-second increments. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Delay/timer You can adjust the delay/timer to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's behavior. If it takes your data is sparse or inconsistent, you may want to use the event timer aggregation method. For the cadence method, the total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration added to the delay/timer. If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using the event flow method with the default settings. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you use the event timer method. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "Sliding windows are a technique for generating charts using the SLIDE BY clause in conjunction with the TIMESERIES clause. With sliding windows, data is gathered in time \"windows\" that overlap with each other. For example, in the image below, a query gathers data with 5 minute windows. The windows \"slide\" by 1 minute. Each window overlaps with the previous window by 4 minutes. 5-minute windows with 1-minute \"slide\" In contrast, with \"tumbling\" or \"cascading\" windows, the windows do not overlap. For example, in this TIMESERIES 3 minutes NRQL query, the windows are 3 minutes in length, with each beginning when the other ends. There is no overlap in the measurement interval. 3-minute windows with no overlap or \"slide\". When to use sliding windows Sliding windows are helpful when you need to smooth out \"spiky\" charts. One common use case is to use sliding windows to smooth line graphs that have a lot of variation over short periods of time in cases where the rolling aggregate (for example a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. In the example below, data varies greatly from one minute to another, so the 1-minute tumbling window chart shows many high peaks and low valleys. TIMESERIES query without SLIDE BY clause However, in this example, 5-minute wide TIMESERIES windows are smoothed with the help of 1-minute SLIDE BY intervals. The query returns similar data but creates a much smoother chart. TIMESERIES query with SLIDE BY clause Valid NRQL syntax for SLIDE BY Valid NRQL syntax for the SLIDE BY clause will follow the format below. SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer1 units SLIDE BY integer2 units Copy integer1 specifies the sliding window width and integer2 specifies the SLIDE BY interval. units is a time unit, such as second, minute, hour, or day. All standard NRQL time units are accepted. Here’s a real-life example. It shows 5-minute TIMESERIES windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval. SELECT average(duration) from Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy Translation from PromQL-style queries When applicable, a PromQL-style query is translated into a NRQL sliding window query. For example, if your PromQL style query uses rate(request_count[5m]) for the past 60 minutes with a 1-minute window overlap, the NRQL translation would be the query below. SELECT rate(sum(request_count), 1 SECONDS) FROM Metric SINCE 3600 SECONDS AGO UNTIL NOW FACET dimensions() LIMIT 100 TIMESERIES 300000 SLIDE BY 60000 Copy In the translation output, the default unit of millisecond is used for TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY clauses. For TIMESERIES, 300000 ms is 300 seconds, or 5 minutes, specifying a window size of 5 minutes. For SLIDE BY, 60000 ms is 60 seconds, specifying a slide interval of 1 minute. Use SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO You can combine SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO arguments to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy Tip When paired with SLIDE BY, TIMESERIES does not support AUTO or MAX. The TIMESERIES value must be an integer time unit value. In other words, SLIDE BY AUTO or SLIDE BY MAX will work, but TIMESERIES AUTO or TIMESERIES MAX followed by SLIDE BY and MAX, AUTO, or a specific integer time unit is not supported. Tip The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which will show up as gaps and unexpected results. If you experience these issues with query results, consider checking for instances of SLIDE BY where the step interval exceeds the window size.",

You might introduce a bug in a release, overlook an edge case, or rely on a broken dependency. These issues, and others, can result in bad user experiences. In this guide, you: Use the open-source New Relic demo-deployer to spin up the infrastructure for Acme Telco Lite, a fictional company. This demo scenario is part of our Demo Catalog and will simulate real-world issues in a controlled, demo environment Use New Relic to understand those issues from the perspective of a Telco Lite developer Use the deployer to tear down the resources you create Welcome to Acme Telco Lite! Acme Telco Lite is a mock telecom business that maintains an eCommerce website for its customers. The site's architecture has eight, interconnected microservices, plus a simulator: The simulator isn't part of the Telco Lite infrastructure, but it is part of the demo deployment. It runs scenarios against the application to create web traffic and generate interesting data in New Relic. Set up your environment Before you begin, follow the Prerequisites guide from the deployer's GitHub repository for a detailed walkthrough of how to set up your environment. For this guide, you can choose between Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host your deployment. The guide steps you through: Installing Docker & pulling the demo-deployer image locally Creating a user config file containing credentials for New Relic and your cloud provider Downloading a .pem key file (if your cloud provider is AWS) Once you're all set up, deploy Acme Telco Lite. Deploy Telco Lite It's time to deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services using demo-deployer. Copy the url for the demo that corresponds to the cloud provider you chose when you set up your environment: AWS Telco Lite Demo Azure Telco Lite Demo GCP Telco Lite Demo Follow the Deployment guide in the Demo Catalog repository for a thorough explanation of how to use the deployer in a local Docker environment. When you run the deployment script, make sure to pass the url you copied for <demo-url>. Tip Since Telco Lite contains several services, the deployment can take over half an hour. When the deloyer is finished, you should see some output stating that the deployment was successful: bash Copy [INFO] Executing Deployment [✔] Parsing and validating Deployment configuration success [✔] Provisioner success [✔] Installing On-Host instrumentation success [✔] Installing Services and instrumentations success [INFO] Deployment successful!

View your services With your services running in the cloud, log in to New Relic and select APM from the top navigation to see how your services are holding up: Yikes! The alerts, high response times, and red-colored indicators suggest things aren't well. Use New Relic to diagnose these issues, which are simultaneously affecting your services: Issue 1: The Warehouse Portal has abnormally high response times Issue 2: Multiple services are raising error alerts Tip Don't worry if you don't see all the same alerts. The simulator triggers issues at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. Tear down Telco Lite When you're finished diagnosing all the issues effecting Telco Lite, follow the Teardown guide in the deployer's repository to tear down the services you created in your cloud provider. If you're still exploring, don't tear down your services, or you'll have to deploy them again later. Conclusion Congratulations, you're done! Throughout this tutorial, you: Used the demo-deployer to deploy Telco Lite to the cloud Used New Relic to investigate simulated issues in Telco Lite services Tore down all the infrastructural resources you created throughout this tutorial Hopefully, you learned a lot about using New Relic to investigate issues in your services. To get your hands on more features of New Relic, pick another demo from the catalog and spin it up with the deployer!",

      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why Telco-Warehouse Portal has slower-than-normal response times. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the high response times in your services. Step 1 of 6 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that the response time for Telco-Warehouse Portal is 43 seconds, much higher than the response times in other services: On the APM page, select the Telco-Warehouse Portal service name to see a summary of that service. The top graph in the summary view shows Web transactions time: You see several peaks, reaching almost 50,000 milliseconds—or 50 seconds! From this graph, you can actually gain a little more insight by toggling the colored components beneath the graph. For example, select Node.js: The graph changes to show only what the Node.js component contributes to the overall response time—less than 100 ms, in this example. Now, select Web external and deselect Node.js: External web traffic is the primary contributor to the high response times. That's a good start, but it doesn't tell the whole story. Next, dive deeper to find out which external service is causing the issue. Step 2 of 6 So, you know that Web external is the culprit of the high response times, but it's hard to tell why. External web traffic is all the requests made from your service to other services. This means you should look into what external requests that the warehouse portal makes to try to understand exactly what external service is the bottleneck. From the left-hand navigation, select Monitor > Distributed tracing: This view shows you requests to the warehouse portal. Select a request from the table at the bottom of the view to see a trace through that request: This trace shows that one external request contributes almost all of the total trace duration. Specifically, an external request to the Telco-Fulfillment Service contributes over 99% of the overall response time. This is good news! You own the fulfillment service, which means you can drill down for even more information. Select the offending row (called a span), and then select Explore this transaction: Step 3 of 6 You're now looking at the __main__:inventory_item transaction overview. Because you know that some part of this transaction is slow, you can use this overview to narrow your focus even further. Similar to how you modified the warehouse portal APM graph, you can look specifically at the components of this transaction to understand where the root cause of the slowness is. Another way to view this information is to scroll down to the Breakdown table in that same view: Function/__main__:inventory_item, a Python function, contributes over 99% of the overall response time. At this point, you know that Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow. You also know that the issue in the fulfillment service is local because over 99% of the request is spent in Python code, not external services. Navigate to the fulfillment service's summary page to look at the service as a whole, instead of this single transaction: Step 4 of 6 Scroll down on this view to familiarize yourself with the graphs it shows, such as Throughput and Error rate. At the bottom of the page, you can see a table with the fulfillment hosts. You can't currently drill into a specific host in the new UI (we're working on it), but you can in the old UI. Toggle Show new view to off and select the host link: Step 5 of 6 Now, you're looking at graphs in the infrastructure view for that service's host. Notice that CPU % has a lot of high spikes. Click and drag on the graph from the start of a spike to the end of it to narrow the timeslice to the period when CPU utilization goes up: If you compare this graph to the fulfillment service's transaction graph you looked at earlier, you'll see that soon after __main__:inventory_item begins executing, the CPU utilization of the host sharply rises to 100%! Step 6 of 6 Now, you understand the problem causing slow response times in the warehouse portal, but you don't know the extent of the issue. Using service maps, you can see all your services that depend on the fullfillment service. Navigate to the service map under APM > Telco-Fulfillment Service: This map shows you the fulfillment service's incoming and outgoing dependencies. Not only is Telco-Warehouse Portal dependent on the fullfillment service, but so is Telco-Web Portal! Select the web portal node to see that the fulfillment service also affects the web portal's response times: Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow The fulfillment service's Python function contributes over 99% of the response time Soon after the Python function starts executing, the host's CPU utilization spikes up to 100% The fulfillment service also affects Telco-Web Portal response times Now, as the developer behind the fulfillment service, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the CPU spikes. Congratulations! You can learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, you can tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

      "body": "With the data explorer you can navigate all your data visually, without any NRQL knowledge. Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces query interfaces to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From the data explorer you can access the query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "Envision your data as a complex system of roads: you need to navigate the signs and signals along the way to quickly see and make meaning of the information you collect. New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. View dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see Data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. Transitioning from Insights Switching to using New Relic One dashboards from our deprecated Insights dashboards? See our transition guide. If you're using the Insights Dashboard API, we have have a migration guide that will help you transition to using the new API. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By duplicating an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Duplicate a dashboard Duplicate any dashboard by clicking the Duplicate dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can duplicate any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the duplicate will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your duplicated dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can duplicate it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. Everything but the metadata is hidden. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by duplicating another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

By passing context about your code to the APIs, you will get the same reporting, including cross application tracing, that you get with New Relic’s built-in instrumentation. Solr This release adds support for Solr versions 5 and 6 (up to and including version 6.3.0). Fixes Fixes a bug that prevents an application from starting up when a JAX-RS annotated method contains more than 8 parameters. Fixes an issue that affected Spring and JAX-RS applications compiled with the Java 8 flag javac -parameters. The issue would cause the application to throw a java.lang.reflect.MalformedParametersException exception. Fixes bug that affected applications implementing JAX-RS endpoints using static methods.

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent provides several options for custom instrumentation. One of those options is adding the Java agent API's @Trace, @TraceLambda or @TraceByReturnType annotations to your application code. This document describes how to use annotations. Important To use annotations, you must modify the source code. If you can't or don't want to modify your source code, see Custom instrumentation for other instrumentation options. Configure your agent for annotations By default, the configuration setting enable_custom_tracing is set to true in the Java agent, which is the setting required for @Trace annotations to function. This setting is not included in the newrelic.yml by default. The only time you need to incorporate this setting into your configuration file is if you want to disable @Trace annotations altogether. To do this, set enable_custom_tracing: false (prefaced with two spaces) in the common stanza of your newrelic.yml. Make sure that newrelic-api.jar appears in your classpath as it contains all these annotations. @Trace Annotating a method with @Trace tells the Java agent that measurements should be taken for that method. To add a method call as a custom trace add @Trace annotations to your method. import com.newrelic.api.agent.Trace; ... @Trace public void run() { // background task } Copy Create a new transaction If transactions do not appear and you want to start a new transaction, include dispatcher=true with the @Trace annotation: @Trace (dispatcher=true) public void run() { // background task } Copy Add detail to your transactions If your transaction traces show large blocks of uninstrumented time and you want to include some more methods within the trace, you can use the @Trace annotation without parameters: @Trace protected void methodWithinTransaction() { // work } Copy Convert a transaction to a web request To make a background task report as a web browser transaction with a Java agent API call: In the method annotated with @Trace(dispatcher=true), call: NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(Request request, Response response) Copy The arguments are implementations of the Request and Response interfaces in newrelic-api.jar. Important Even if your Request and Response objects already are present, you still need to add this API call. Define your own @Trace annotation class If you define your own @Trace annotation class, there is no dependency on the newrelic-api.jar. To define the class: package com.test; @Target(ElementType.METHOD) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) public @interface Trace { public static final String NULL = \"\"; String metricName() default NULL; boolean dispatcher() default false; String tracerFactoryName() default NULL; } Copy Then, configure the agent to use this annotation in the common section of the newrelic.yml: class_transformer: trace_annotation_class_name: com.test.Trace Copy Properties for @Trace The @Trace annotation supports the following properties. dispatcher Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the agent will start a transaction when it reaches a method with this @Trace annotation if a transaction is not already in progress. If a transaction is already in progress, the method with this annotation will be included in the ongoing transaction, rather than starting a new one. If false (default), no metrics will be recorded if the agent has not started a transaction before the @Trace annotation is reached. For example: @Trace(dispatcher=true) Copy async Type: Boolean Default: false If true, this method is marked as asynchronous and the agent will trace this method if it linked to an existing transaction. For example: @Trace(async=true) Copy If false (default), the method is not marked as asynchronous. If other @Trace annotations are present and the method is not executing asynchronously, it will still be traced. metricName Type: String Default: (none) This property affects transaction traces and error reporting. By default, the metric name will include the class name followed by the method name. If you do not want class followed by method, then you can use this property to change the metric name. If you set the metricName, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\"), then the time spent in this method will appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. If you set the metricName in addition to the dispatcher, as in @Trace(metricName=\"YourMessageHere\", dispatcher=true), then the transaction name will appear as YourMessageHere in the APM Transactions page but the time spent in this method will not appear as YourMessageHere in any transaction trace. Here is an example: @Trace(metricName=\"YourMetricName\") Copy Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. excludeFromTransactionTrace Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the method will be excluded from the transaction trace. The agent will still collect metrics for the method. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true) Copy leaf Type: Boolean Default: false A leaf tracer has no child tracers. This is useful when you want all time attributed to the tracer, even if other trace points are encountered the tracer's execution. Database tracers often act as a leaf so that all time is attributed to database activity, even if instrumented external calls are made. Here is an example: @Trace(leaf=true) Copy If a leaf tracer does not participate in transaction traces, the agent can create a tracer with lower overhead. Here is an example: @Trace(excludeFromTransactionTrace=true, leaf=true) Copy @TraceLambda If your transaction traces show large blocks of uninstrumented time and you want to include lambda expressions within the trace, you can use the @TraceLambda annotation without parameters: import com.newrelic.api.agent.TraceLambda; @TraceLambda class ClassContainingLambdaExpressions() { // work } Copy Lambda expressions become static methods of the containing class after compilation. By default, static methods within classes marked with the @TraceLambda annotation matching the annotations pattern will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Properties for @TraceLambda The @TraceLambda annotation supports the following properties. pattern Type: String Default: ^\\$?(lambda\\|anonfun)\\$(?\\<name\\>.*) If you set the pattern, as in @TraceLambda(pattern=\"YourPattern\"), then the marked classes method names will be matched against the regex pattern YourPattern. If matched the related method will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Here is an example: @TraceLambda(pattern=\"YourPattern\") Copy includeNonstatic Type: Boolean Default: false If true, the marked classes nonstatic methods will be eligible for assessment against the pattern for instrumentation. Here is an example: @TraceLambda(includeNonstatic=\"true\") Copy @TraceByReturnType To include methods with a particular return type within the trace, you can use the @TraceByReturnType annotation to mark a class passing the return types as a property. Methods in annotated classes that match one of the specified return types will be marked with the @Trace annotation. @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={Integer.class, String.class}) class ClassContainingMethods() { // ... } Copy Properties for @TraceByReturnType The @TraceByReturnType annotation supports the following properties. traceReturnTypes Type: List < Class> Default: empty list If you set the traceReturnTypes, as in @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={String.class}), then the marked classes method return types will be matched against the String.class. All matched methods will be marked with the @Trace annotation. Here is an example: @TraceByReturnType(traceReturnTypes={Integer.class, String.class}) class ClassContainingMethods() { public String doSomething() { // matches // ... } public Long somethingElse() { // does not match // ... } } Copy Performance considerations When the Java agent is present in the JVM, it will inject code on the annotated methods. The performance hit is negligible in heavyweight operations, such as database or webservice calls, but is noticeable in methods that are called frequently, such as an accessor called thousands of times a second. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to decreased performance and to a metric grouping issue.

      "body": "For your New Relic-monitored Java application, one custom instrumentation method is to use an XML file that lists the methods and classes you want to instrument. This documentation shows an example XML instrumentation file. For more information, see Java instrumentation by XML. Edit XML file in UI To edit your XML file directly from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Settings > Instrumentation. From here you can: Download a sample XML file. Select an edit existing XML file. Search the instrumentation history. XML file format The XML file format includes root and child nodes. Caution Do not instrument all of your methods, as this can lead to a metric grouping issue. Root node: extension The root node of an XML file is extension. It can have three different attributes: Value Definition name A unique but descriptive name identifying your XML extension. enabled Identifies whether the extension will be read by the Java agent. Default is true. If false, New Relic will ignore the extension. version The version of the extension. If two extensions have the same name, only the extension with the highest version will be used. Instrumentation (child of extension) The instrumentation node is a child of extension. It can have one attribute: metricPrefix. This is the prefix used for the metric names when the nameTransaction node is not specified. Default is CUSTOM. Pointcut (child of instrumentation) The pointcut is a child node of instrumentation and can have several attributes. Also, a pointcut can have several different child nodes. Value Definition transactionStartPoint If a transaction is not already in progress when this pointcut is reached, then a transaction will be started. If a transaction is already in progress, then that transaction will continue. A new transaction will not be created. metricNameFormat The name format to use for a metric. If not present, then this will default to the class name followed by the method name. You can only set the metricNameFormat on pointcuts where transactionStartPoint is set to false. excludeFromTransactionTrace When true the transaction trace will not be provided if this pointcut initiates the transaction. If the pointcut is reached in the middle of a transaction, then the transaction trace will still be present, but this method will be excluded from the call graph. ignoreTransaction When true the entire transaction will be ignored. transactionType Sets the type of the transaction. Possible values are background (default, reported as a non-web transaction) and web (reported as a web transaction). Child nodes for pointcut A pointcut can have several different child nodes: Value Definition nameTransaction If this element is present, the agent will name the transaction using the class name and method(s) instrumented by this pointcut. methodAnnotation The case sensitive full name of an annotation class including the package name. All methods that are marked with this annotation will be matched. className The case sensitive name of the class to match, including the package name. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the interfaceName node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The className node has the attribute includeSubclasses. If true the methods on the class with the matching name will be instrumented along with the matching methods on any child class of this class. If false (default), only methods on the exact class specified will be instrumented. The className must follow these rules: Inner classes can be instrumented. The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. To match subclasses of the specified class, set the attribute includeSubclasses to true. interfaceName The case sensitive name of an interface, including the package name, whose implementation classes will be matched. Pair this node with the method node. If this node is present on a pointcut, then the className node cannot be present on the same pointcut node. The interfaceName must follow this rule: The full package structure with dots between packages must be used. method A method on the class to instrument. Pair this node with a className node. Also, the method node can have children. traceByReturnType The class name, including package, in the format used in bytecode, e.g. Ljava/lang/String;. All methods that return an object of that class will be matched. traceLambda A boolean indicating whether to match lambdas. The traceLambda node has the attributes: includeNonstatic - a boolean indicating whether to match non static methods (defaults to false); pattern - a string with the pattern to search for the lambda methods. Child nodes for method The method node can have several children. For more information and examples, see Troubleshooting Java custom instrumentation. Value Definition name The exact case sensitive name of the method to match. A method name node must follow these rules: Public, protected, private, and package methods can all be instrumented. Static and instance methods can be instrumented. Constructors cannot be instrumented. parameters The parameter types of the method specified in order. If the parameters element is not present, then all methods matching the name will be matched. This includes private and protected declarations. A method parameters node contains a list of the method's parameters, specified by type elements. Here are the major rules for the type elements: Primitives are specified using their normal name: int, float, double, long, byte, short, boolean, char. Objects require a full package structure. For example, do not use String in the XML; instead, use java.lang.String. Do not use generics with collection objects. For example, write java.util.List instead of java.util.List<String>. Include brackets for arrays. For example, an array of integers will be int[ ] and an array of strings will be java.lang.String[ ]. Include two sets of brackets for an array of arrays. For example, an array of arrays of longs would be long[ ][ ]. To send the parameter as an analytic event to New Relic One, add an XML attribute to the type element called attributeName. To use a method with no parameters, the parameters node needs to be present to match a \"no arguments\" method. returnType The case sensitive name of a class indicating a return type to match. All methods that return this class type will be matched. Example Here is a sample class and an XML file that could be used to instrument that class. Sample class package test; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class SampleTester { private String configName; private Map<String, Long> maxSampleTimes; public SampleTester(String pConfigName) { configName = pConfigName; maxSampleTimes = new HashMap<>(); } public void checkSample(String name, long[] times) { if (times != null) { maxSampleTimes.put(name, getFirst(times)); } else { maxSampleTimes.put(name, (long) getFirst()); } } private Long getFirst(long[] times) { return times[0]; } private int getFirst() { return 0; } public void printMaxRepeat(final long max) throws Exception { Runnable myRunnable = new Runnable() { public void run() { try { printMax(max); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }; ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1); scheduledExecutor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(myRunnable, 0, 10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); } private void printMax(long max) { System.out.println(\"max is \" + max); } } Copy Sample XML instrumentation file and explanation <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <extension xmlns=\"https://newrelic.com/docs/java/xsd/v1.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"newrelic-extension extension.xsd \" name=\"customExtension\" version=\"1.0\"> <instrumentation metricPrefix=\"EXAMPLE\"> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"true\"> <!--class name is preceded by package name--> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>checkSample</name> <parameters> <type attributeName=\"sampleName\">java.lang.String</type> <type>long[]</type> </parameters> </method> <!--two methods with the same name but different signatures can share one node--> <method> <name>getFirst</name> </method> <method> <name>run</name> </method> </pointcut> <pointcut transactionStartPoint=\"false\" ignoreTransaction=\"false\" excludeFromTransactionTrace=\"false\" metricNameFormat=\"SampleTester/methods\"> <className>test.SampleTester</className> <method> <name>printMaxRepeat</name> </method> <method> <name>printMax</name> </method> </pointcut> </instrumentation> </extension> Copy The first block of the XML file specifies the name and version of the extension. As the XML extension is default enabled, that attribute is not specified. The second block specifies the methods in SampleClass that should be instrumented. A transaction is started at the beginning of the block. It is worth noting that in the example class, there are two methods that share a name (getFirst) but have different signatures. These are instrumented with a single method node. By removing the parameters node, all methods with the same name can be matched under one method node. In the third block, the specified methods do not have a transaction started on them. This is because the transaction has already been started in run. The transaction will not be ignored, and will be included in the transaction trace.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. Important For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 6.4.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Distributed tracing API usage These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. See Java agent configuration for all distributed tracing config options. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. To see these APIs in action, see Using Java agent distributing tracing API with Kafka. Important With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs were introduced, with the exception of addCustomAttribute(), which was introduced in 6.1.0. We highly recommended using these APIs instead of the deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create and insert distributed tracing headers into a Headers data structure. This API will insert both newrelic and W3C Trace Context headers (traceparent & tracestate), unless the agent is explicitly configured to exclude newrelic headers. Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Accept the distributed tracing headers sent from the calling service and link these services together in a distributed trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(TransportType, Headers) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. The type-specific headers of an inbound or outbound message. For a provided implementation of Headers use ConcurrentHashMapHeaders. Headers Copy A utility class that provides enum constants for defining the transport type when accepting distributed tracing headers. TransportType Copy Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Caution With agent version 6.4.0, the following distributed tracing APIs have been deprecated and replaced by the APIs in the above table. It's highly recommended to upgrade the agent and use the new APIs instead of these deprecated ones. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) Copy For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other API classes, see Obtain references. Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Caution API deprecated as of agent 6.4.0 Cross application tracing (CAT) API usage To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Copy Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic API classes. Obtain references to New Relic API classes Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Copy Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Copy Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights (our original name for the feature that governed custom events) in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Copy Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the last call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Copy Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic API classes.

      "body": "This doc contains tutorials on how to use NerdGraph to programmatically manage some New Relic API keys. For general information about New Relic keys, see API keys. Overview of feature description You can use the API keys UI to create and manage keys. Alternatively, you can use NerdGraph's ApiAccess field to programmatically create and manage the following types of keys: User keys License keys, including: General license key (used for APM, infrastructure monitoring, more) Browser key (for browser monitoring) One common use case for this feature is the ability to create and manage license keys to let you rotate keys for security purposes. Note that you can't use this NerdGraph functionality to manage or delete your original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage the ones you've created. Notes about this functionality: All mutations can accept multiple keys as arguments, and will return details about successful changes and errors. See examples below for details. All mutations (create, update and delete) will result in an NrAuditEvent that can be queried for auditing purposes. For details, see Audit events. Regarding license keys: License keys are categorized by NerdGraph as ingest keys. This is because their main use is to allow data ingest. You can create up to 1,000 keys of each license key type, which allows for key rotation. You can't manage or delete original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage keys you've created. Before using examples Things to note before using these example queries: The examples below use license keys (aka ingest keys), but you can query user keys in similar ways, replacing the ingest-key-specific fields with user-key-specific fields. To understand the data structure, we recommend experimenting with queries using the GraphiQL explorer. You can also create, view, and delete user keys using the UI. Create keys Tip You can find and generate user keys using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, at the top of that interface. To create multiple keys (user key or license key) in a single mutation, for multiple accounts and key types. Note that the mutation can return successfully created keys as well as any errors encountered trying to create keys. Example of creating a key: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {ingest: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ingestType: BROWSER, name: \"Browser Key\", notes: \"A note.\"}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Here's an example of using this query to create a user key: Create a user key To create a user key, you'd change the above query slightly, in the keys section: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {user: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, userId: YOUR_USER_ID}}) { createdKeys { id key name notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Copy Update keys The update mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. mutation { apiAccessUpdateKeys(keys: {ingest: {keyId: KEY_ID, name: \"Updated name\", notes: \"A new note!\"}}) { updatedKeys { id key type name notes } errors { message } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Delete keys The delete mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. Deleted keys will no longer grant access to New Relic systems and will no longer be returned by queries to the API access GraphQL API. mutation { apiAccessDeleteKeys(keys: {ingestKeyIds: INGEST_KEY_ID}) { deletedKeys { id } errors { message } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Query keys You can access ingest and user keys by querying a single key or all keys, scoped to the actor. If querying for a single key, you must provide the key ID and type (INGEST or USER). Querying for multiple keys is done via a key search, which uses a mandatory types list and an optional scope to filter results. User keys belonging to other users will be obfuscated in the results. Single key example query: query { actor { apiAccess { key(id: INGEST_KEY_ID, keyType: INGEST) { key name type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } Copy Key search example query: query { actor { apiAccess { keySearch(query: {types: INGEST, scope: {ingestTypes: BROWSER}}) { keys { name key type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } } Copy Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries.",

      "body": "You can manage alerts conditions using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some conditions queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. This document covers the following: Steps to create a NRQL condition NRQL static condition NRQL baseline condition NRQL outlier condition Update a condition Update mutations List and filter NRQL conditions Singular NRQL condition queries Create a description Delete conditions Steps to create a NRQL condition Follow these steps: Decide which condition type you want to create (see NRQL Condition threshold types). Find your relevant policyID by doing one of the following: Use the NerdGraph policies API. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Choose a policy. Find the ID under the policy name. Provide the appropriate mutation for your NRQL condition type and the relevant values. Tip The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer is the best place to find up-to-date documentation about the per-field specifics of the NerdGraph NRQL Conditions API. For example, questions like \"What does the valueFunction field accept?\" are best answered with the inline NerdGraph documentation. NRQL static condition Here's an example of creating a static condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Low Host Count - Catastrophic\" enabled: true nrql: { query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) from Transaction where appName='my-app-name'\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 2 thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE thresholdDuration: 600 operator: BELOW priority: CRITICAL } valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name } } Copy NRQL baseline condition Here's an example of creating a baseline condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" enabled: true baselineDirection: UPPER_ONLY nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 13 thresholdDuration: 180 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name baselineDirection } } Copy NRQL outlier condition Here's an example of creating an outlier condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionOutlierCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Outlier Condition\" enabled: true expectedGroups: 4 openViolationOnGroupOverlap: false nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 evaluationOffset: 3 } terms: { threshold: 1 thresholdDuration: 300 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name expectedGroups openViolationOnGroupOverlap } } Copy Update a condition Complete the following: Determine the type of your existing condition by requesting the type field in a nrqlConditionsSearch query like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id type } } } } } } Copy Tip The type returned is what you use for your update mutation. For example, if the type returned is STATIC, use alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate. If the type returned is BASELINE, use alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate. If the type returned is OUTLIER, use alertsNrqlConditionOutlierUpdate. Provide the id of your condition to your relevant condition type mutation. Note that you can only update conditions of the relevant type. Only provide update mutations for the fields you want to update. Fields you don't provide in the update are not touched. Update mutations Only fields that you provide in the update are changed. In the following example, baselineDirection returns unchanged, but name is updated. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID, accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, condition: { name: \"Your updated name\" }) { id name baselineDirection } } Copy List and filter NRQL conditions To list or filter your NRQL conditions, use the nrqlConditionsSearch query in NerdGraph. Use cursor pagination The basic of list functionality for NRQL conditions allows you to paginate through your NRQL conditions as well as request the total count of conditions per account. The nrqlConditionsSearch query utilizes cursor pagination to paginate through resources. The idea behind cursor pagination is that the client will request a cursor in a programmatic loop until the cursor comes back empty. An initial list response will look something like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } Copy This example returns a JSON response like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nextCursor\": \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"id\": \"4432\", \"name\": \"Baseline Condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"443\", \"name\": \"A static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\" }, // more conditions here in reality ], \"totalCount\": 435 } } } } }, } Copy In order to paginate through conditions in the response, have the client request the cursor to be returned until the nextCursor returns from the response as null: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(cursor: \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", ) { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } Copy Request type-specific fields Certain fields are only available on specific NRQL condition types. The main reason that mutations are split between the different condition types is because they have minor differences between the fields they accept. For example, valueFunction is only relevant for static NRQL conditions and baselineDirection is only relevant on baseline NRQL conditions. But if these fields are only available on these certain condition types, how do we return them in a list of all of our condition types? The answer is a GraphQL convention known as inline fragments. Inline fragments allow you to access the data on a specific type of NRQL condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id name type ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } ...on AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition { baselineDirection } ...on AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition { expectedGroups } } } } } } } Copy In the previous example query, we are asking GraphQL to do the hard work for us to determine which NRQL conditions are the correct type. So, when the returned type is a static condition, it will return the valueFunction in the object. When the returned type is a baseline condition, it will return baselineDirection instead, and when the type is an outlier condition, it will return expectedGroups. Here is an example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"baselineDirection\": \"UPPER_ONLY\", \"id\": \"342\", \"name\": \"My baseline condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"553\", \"name\": \"My static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\", \"valueFunction\": \"SINGLE_VALUE\" }, { \"expectedGroups\": 4, \"id\": \"802\", \"name\": \"My outlier condition\", \"type\": \"OUTLIER\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Filter NRQL conditions You can filter NRQL conditions with the searchCriteria argument of the nrqlConditionsSearch query: Here's an example of filtering NRQL conditions with matching by name. This query returns NRQL conditions that match the provided name. Note that this match is case insensitive. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(searchCriteria: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" }) { nrqlConditions { id name type } } } } } } Copy Singular NRQL condition queries You can use the NRQL condition API to query for a singular condition. Run the nrqlCondition query in the alerts namespace. Similar to type specific fields on the nrqlConditionSearch query, you can also use these inline fragments to request fields that are restricted to a NRQL condition type. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id name ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } } } } } } Copy Update the description This will walk you through the procedure to create a description for a NRQL alert condition. Get all the conditions for a policy: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditions(policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID) { nextCursor results { id name description enabled nrql { query } signal { aggregationWindow evaluationOffset } policyId runbookUrl terms { duration operator priority timeFunction threshold } type violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Get the details for a single condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\") { description id enabled name nrql { query } signal { aggregationWindow evaluationOffset } policyId runbookUrl terms { operator priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } type violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } Copy Create a mutation with the description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { description } } Copy Here's an example mutation with an included example description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy Delete conditions You can use the alertsConditionDelete mutation to delete any type of condition. You can only request the id field on a delete mutation; for example: mutation { alertsConditionDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id } } Copy",

Starting out with NerdGraph If you're new to NerdGraph and GraphQL, you may want to first read our Introduction to NerdGraph. If you’re already familiar with the dashboards API, you can read Create dashboards with NerdGraph. When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. Find the NerdGraph API explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Operations We have defined a granular GraphQL API that lets you execute different dashboard operations depending on their goal and scope. Dashboard CRUD operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes actor > entity() query Get dashboard operation. You can get all dashboard and widget data for a given dashboard entity GUID. dashboardCreate() mutation Create dashboard operation. You can create a dashboard attached to a specific account by specifying all its elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardUpdate() mutation Update dashboard operation. You can update an existing dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. You need to specify the complete, updated dashboard elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardDelete() mutation Delete dashboard operation. You can delete an existing dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. This operation executes a logical delete that lets you recover your dashboard. dashboardUndelete() mutation Undelete dashboard operation. You can recover a previously deleted dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. Dashboard page operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes dashboardUpdatePage() mutation Update dashboard page operation. You can update one page of an existing dashboard given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the complete, updated dashboard page elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardUpdateWidgetsInPage() mutation Update widgets operation. You can update a set of existing widgets of a dashboard page given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the set of widgets to be updated and their complete configuration. dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() mutation Add widgets operation. You can add a set of new widgets to a dashboard page given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the set of new widgets and their complete configuration. Other operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes dashboardCreateSnapshotUrl() mutation Create dashboard page snapshot operation. You can create a public URL for a given dashboard page entity GUID. The dashboard page can then be accessed in the form of a static snapshot in the resulting public URL. actor > dashboard > liveUrls() query List all live URLs operation. You can get the complete list of live URLs you have access to. A live URL is a mechanism that allows you to share dashboard pages and widgets publicly with up-to-date or live data. dashboardWidgetRevokeLiveUrl() mutation Revoke widget live URL operation. You can revoke a previously created live URL of a widget. As a result, the live URL will become unavailable to the public. Limits We have limited the values you can set to some of the dashboard properties. This allows us to keep dashboards in good shape while boosting their usability. Dashboard limits Limit Value Maximum number of pages in a dashboard 20 Maximum length of a dashboard name 255 Maximum length of a dashboard description 1024 Dashboard page limits Limit Value Maximum number of widgets in a dashboard page 100 Maximum length of a dashboard page name 255 Maximum length of a dashboard page description 1024 Widget limits Limit Value Maximum length of a widget title 255 Maximum number of entities linked to a widget 1 Maximum number of queries in a widget 20 Maximum layout column of a widget 12 Minimum layout column of a widget 1 Minimum layout row of a widget 1 Maximum layout width of a widget 12 Minimum layout width of a widget 1 Maximum layout height of a widget 32 Minimum layout height of a widget 1 Errors as first class citizens All dashboard mutations offer a way to ask for errors when being executed. This means that you can perform your dashboard mutations and check the response in order to detect expected potential issues. Every error has a type and a description to help you identify what’s the source of the problem. Errors as part of every mutation response mutation { dashboardMutation(guid: \"MY_EXISTING_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { mutationResult { result } errors { description type } } } Copy Keep in mind that these are expected errors that we are aware of in advance. You should also check for unexpected errors that will be returned in the standard GraphQL errors field.",

Baseline alerting is useful for creating conditions that: Only notify you when data is behaving abnormally. Dynamically adjust to changing data and trends, including daily or weekly trends. In addition, baseline alerting works well with new applications when you do not yet have known behaviors. How it works When you choose a data source (for example, an APM metric) for a baseline condition, we'll use the past values of that data to dynamically predict the data's near-future behavior. The line of that predicted future behavior for that value is called a baseline. It appears as a dotted black line on the preview chart in the baseline condition UI. You'll use the baseline alert condition UI to: Adjust how sensitive the condition is to fluctuations in the data source. Set the behavior that will trigger a violation (for example: \"deviating for more than five minutes\"). Set whether you want the condition to check for upper violations, lower violations, or both. When your data escapes the predicted \"normal\" behavior and meets the criteria you've chosen, you'll receive a notification.

Set the preview chart to either 2 days or 7 days of displayed data. (Not applicable for NRQL alert conditions.) Use the slider bar to adjust the Critical threshold sensitivity, represented in the preview chart by the light gray area around the baseline. The tighter the band around the baseline, the more sensitive it is and the more violations it will generate. Optional: You can create a Warning threshold (the darker gray area around the baseline). For NRQL alerts, see the allowed types of NRQL queries. If the alert condition applies to multiple apps, you can select a choice from the dropdown above the chart to use different metrics. (Not applicable for NRQL alert conditions.) Faceted baseline conditions NRQL alerts conditions support faceted baselines. In the chart legend, click a time series to scope it to a single facet. Once you've run a faceted NRQL query for a baseline condition, you can scope your results to a single baseline. Click Return to full timeseries list to go back to seeing all your facets. The single time series shows the baseline, threshold band, and one or more violation regions, if there are any. Baseline rules and settings Here are some details about how the UI works: Rules governing creation of baseline The algorithm for baseline conditions is mathematically complex. Here are some of the major rules governing its predictive abilities: Data trait Baseline rules Age of data On initial creation, the baseline is calculated using between 1 to 4 weeks of data, depending on data availability and baseline type. After its creation, the algorithm will take into account ongoing data fluctuations over a long time period, although greater weight is given to more recent data. For data that has only existed for a short time, the baseline will likely fluctuate a good deal and not be very accurate. This is because there is not yet enough data to determine its usual values and behavior. The more history the data has, the more accurate the baseline and thresholds will become. Consistency of data For metric values that remain in a consistent range or that trend slowly and steadily, their more predictable behavior means that their thresholds will become tighter around the baseline. Data that is more varied and unpredictable will have looser (wider) thresholds. Regular fluctuations For shorter-than-one-week cyclical fluctuations (such as weekly Wednesday 1pm deployments or nightly reports), the baseline algorithm looks for these cyclical fluctuations and attempts to adjust to them. Baseline direction: select upper or lower ranges You can choose whether you want the condition to violate for behavior that goes above the baseline (\"upper\") or that goes below the baseline (\"lower\"), or that goes either above or below. You choose these with the Baseline direction selector. Example use cases for this: You might use the Upper setting for a data source like error rate, because you generally are only concerned if it goes up, and aren't concerned if it goes down. You might use the Lower setting for a data source like throughput, because sudden upward fluctuations are quite common, but a large sudden downswing would be a sign of a problem. Here are examples of how large fluctuations in your data would be treated under the different baseline direction settings. The red areas represent violations. Preview chart: select 2 or 7 days Not applicable for NRQL alert conditions. When setting thresholds, the preview chart has an option for displaying Since 2 days ago or Since 7 days ago. These selections are not the time period used to compute the baseline; they are only the time range used for a preview display. For more about the time range used to calculate the baseline, see the algorithm rules.",

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow detail Event flow starts aggregating data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Event timer detail Like event flow, event timer only starts aggregating data when data arrives. When a data point arrives, a timer starts to count down. If no data arrives before the timer counts down, the data is evaluated. When a data point arrives before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 15 seconds and 15 minutes, in 15-second increments. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with None, the last value received, or a static value. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier condition types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL conditions produce a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL conditions, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation duration window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple aggregation functions Each condition can only target a single aggregated value. To alert on multiple values simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline condition types. The outlier condition type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy NRQL conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window duration is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period NRQL conditions evaluate data based on how it's aggregated, using aggregation windows from 15 seconds to 15 minutes, in increments of 15 seconds. For best results, we recommend using the event flow or event timer aggregation methods. For the cadence aggregation method, the implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your delay/timer setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window duration, the delay/timer, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert condition types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of conditions: NRQL alert condition types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL condition. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) condition types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. Note that when you have a faceted query, each facet is a signal. So if any one of those signals ends during the duration specified, that will be considered a loss of signal. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, use the advanced signal settings to control streaming alert data and avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window duration Delay/timer Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window duration You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between 15 seconds and 15 minutes, in 15-second increments. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Delay/timer You can adjust the delay/timer to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's behavior. If it takes your data is sparse or inconsistent, you may want to use the event timer aggregation method. For the cadence method, the total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration added to the delay/timer. If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using the event flow method with the default settings. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you use the event timer method. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why some services are raising alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the error alerts in your services. Step 1 of 8 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal have opened critical violations for high error percentages: Tip If you don't see all the same alerts, don't worry. The simulated issues happen at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. The deployment has created an alert condition for cases where a service's error percentage rises above 10% for 5 minutes or longer. A critical violation means that the service's conditions violate that threshold. Begin your investigation by selecting the Telco-Web Portal service name. Step 2 of 8 You're now on the web portal's APM summary page. The top graph, Web transactions time, shows you the service's response times. By default, it also displays periods of critical violation. On the right-hand side of the view, Application activity shows when violations opened and closed: From the left-hand navigation, select Events > Errors to learn more about the errors: At the bottom of the view, the Errors table shows you what errors occurred in the service along with number of times each error occurred. In this scenario, the only error in the service has the following message: bash Copy An error occurred during a downstream request to http://35.182.223.70:7001/api/inventory detail:response code 500 This is a helpful message that explains that the web portal made a request to another service, raised an error, and responded with a response code of 500, indicating an Internal server error. Since this message tells you that the error occurred while the web portal was making an outbound request, use distributed tracing to better understand the issue. Select Monitor > Distributed tracing from the left-hand navigation. Step 3 of 8 Distributed tracing provides end-to-end information about a request. In this case, you're looking for a request to the web portal that raised an error, so that you can better understand what happened during that request. Filter the table, by selecting the Errors column header twice, to order by descending counts: Select the first row in the table: This trace gives a lot of information about what happened with the request once the web portal received it. One of the things that the trace reveals is that the web portal made a GET request to Telco-Login Service and received an error. The trace indicates an error by coloring the text red. Select the row (called a span) to see more information about the request to the login service: Expand Error details to see the error message: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic Interesting! This message says that, at the time that the web portal made the GET request to the login service, the login service was not ready to accept traffic. Inspect the login service to dive further into the root cause of these cascading errors. Return to the APM page, and select Telco-Login Service. Step 4 of 8 Notice that the APM summary for Telco-Login Service has similar red flags to the ones in the web portal: Web transactions time has a red error indicator, and Application activity shows critical violations. More than that, the times that the errors occurred in both services match up (around 10:53 AM, in this example). Step 5 of 8 Web transactions time, in APM, shows that requests to the login service spend all their time in Java code. So, in the left-hand navigation, open Monitor > JVMs: Java Virtual Machines, or JVMs, run Java processes, such as those used by the login service. This view shows resource graphs for each JVM your service uses. Change the timeslice to look at data for the last 3 hours, so you can get a better idea of how the service has been behaving: Notice, in Heap memory usage, that the line for Used Heap rises consistently over 30 minute intervals. About two-thirds of the way through each interval, the line for Committed Heap (the amount of JVM heap memory dedicated for use by Java processes) quickly rises to accommodate the increasing memory demands. This graph indicates that the Java process is leaking memory. Step 6 of 8 Your Java process is leaking memory, but you need to understand the extent of the leak's impact. Navigate to the login service's host infrastructure view to dive a little deeper. First, go to the Telco-Login Service summary page and turn off Show new view: Then, scroll to the bottom of the page, and select the host's name: Right now, you can only select the host's name from the old version of the UI (we're working on it). So, make sure you toggle off Show new view. In this infrastructure view, Memory Used % for Telco-Authentication-host consistently climbs from around 60% to around 90% over 30-minute intervals, matching the intervals in the JVM's heap memory usage graph: Therefore, the memory leak effects the login service's entire host. Click and drag on Memory Used % to narrow the timeslice to one of the peaks: Now, compare this graph with the login service's Errors graph to see how they relate. Step 7 of 8 Open New Relic in a new tab. From APM, select Telco-Login Service. Then, navigate to Events > Errors. By comparing these graphs, you see that the memory percentage reached its peak at 10:25 AM (in this example) and then dropped off. You also see that errors started occurring in the login service just after that, at 10:26 AM. The message for those errors is the same one you saw earlier: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic This suggests that the memory leaks cause the application to fail for a time. To understand the error a bit more, select the error class from the table at the bottom of the view: The stack trace shows that the service raised an UnhandledException from a function called EnsureAppIsStarted: With the information you've collected so far, you can conclude that Telco-Login Service's Java code has a memory leak. Also, the login service restarts the application when it runs out of memory, and it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests while the app is restarting. You also know the login service is effecting the web portal, because that is what introduced you to this problem, but does the issue effect any other services? Step 8 of 8 Visualize service dependencies using service maps. First, navigate back to APM, and from Telco-Login Service, select Monitor > Service map: Both Telco-Web Portal and Telco-Warehouse Portal depend on Telco-Login Service. So, when the login service goes down, you start seeing errors in both portals. Extra Credit Use the same steps you used to investigate issues in the web portal to confirm there are issues in the warehouse portal. Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal raise alerts during critical violations The login service's Java processes leak memory When the login service's host, Telco-Authentication-host, runs out of memory, it restarts the login application While the login application is restarting, it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests When the web portal and the warehouse portal make requests to the login service while it's restarting, they receive errors and raise errors of their own Now, as a Telco Lite developer, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the memory leak. Congratulations! Learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

The top graph in the summary view shows Web transactions time: You see several peaks, reaching almost 50,000 milliseconds—or 50 seconds! From this graph, you can actually gain a little more insight by toggling the colored components beneath the graph. For example, select Node.js: The graph changes to show only what the Node.js component contributes to the overall response time—less than 100 ms, in this example. Now, select Web external and deselect Node.js: External web traffic is the primary contributor to the high response times. That's a good start, but it doesn't tell the whole story. Next, dive deeper to find out which external service is causing the issue. Step 2 of 6 So, you know that Web external is the culprit of the high response times, but it's hard to tell why. External web traffic is all the requests made from your service to other services. This means you should look into what external requests that the warehouse portal makes to try to understand exactly what external service is the bottleneck. From the left-hand navigation, select Monitor > Distributed tracing: This view shows you requests to the warehouse portal. Select a request from the table at the bottom of the view to see a trace through that request: This trace shows that one external request contributes almost all of the total trace duration. Specifically, an external request to the Telco-Fulfillment Service contributes over 99% of the overall response time. This is good news! You own the fulfillment service, which means you can drill down for even more information. Select the offending row (called a span), and then select Explore this transaction: Step 3 of 6 You're now looking at the __main__:inventory_item transaction overview. Because you know that some part of this transaction is slow, you can use this overview to narrow your focus even further. Similar to how you modified the warehouse portal APM graph, you can look specifically at the components of this transaction to understand where the root cause of the slowness is. Another way to view this information is to scroll down to the Breakdown table in that same view: Function/__main__:inventory_item, a Python function, contributes over 99% of the overall response time. At this point, you know that Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow. You also know that the issue in the fulfillment service is local because over 99% of the request is spent in Python code, not external services. Navigate to the fulfillment service's summary page to look at the service as a whole, instead of this single transaction: Step 4 of 6 Scroll down on this view to familiarize yourself with the graphs it shows, such as Throughput and Error rate. At the bottom of the page, you can see a table with the fulfillment hosts. You can't currently drill into a specific host in the new UI (we're working on it), but you can in the old UI. Toggle Show new view to off and select the host link: Step 5 of 6 Now, you're looking at graphs in the infrastructure view for that service's host. Notice that CPU % has a lot of high spikes. Click and drag on the graph from the start of a spike to the end of it to narrow the timeslice to the period when CPU utilization goes up: If you compare this graph to the fulfillment service's transaction graph you looked at earlier, you'll see that soon after __main__:inventory_item begins executing, the CPU utilization of the host sharply rises to 100%! Step 6 of 6 Now, you understand the problem causing slow response times in the warehouse portal, but you don't know the extent of the issue. Using service maps, you can see all your services that depend on the fullfillment service. Navigate to the service map under APM > Telco-Fulfillment Service: This map shows you the fulfillment service's incoming and outgoing dependencies. Not only is Telco-Warehouse Portal dependent on the fullfillment service, but so is Telco-Web Portal! Select the web portal node to see that the fulfillment service also affects the web portal's response times: Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Warehouse Portal is slow because it makes an external request to Telco-Fulfillment Service, which is slow The fulfillment service's Python function contributes over 99% of the response time Soon after the Python function starts executing, the host's CPU utilization spikes up to 100% The fulfillment service also affects Telco-Web Portal response times Now, as the developer behind the fulfillment service, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the CPU spikes. Congratulations! You can learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, you can tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

      "body": "With the data explorer you can navigate all your data visually, without any NRQL knowledge. Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces query interfaces to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From the data explorer you can access the query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By duplicating an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Duplicate a dashboard Duplicate any dashboard by clicking the Duplicate dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can duplicate any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the duplicate will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your duplicated dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can duplicate it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. Everything but the metadata is hidden. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by duplicating another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn how to set up New Relic alerts with Terraform. More specifically, you provision an alert policy, four alert conditions, and a notification channel. The four alert conditions are based on the four golden signals of monitoring introduced in Google’s Site Reliability Engineering book: Latency: The amount of time it takes your application to service a request. Traffic: The amount of requests your system receives. Errors: The rate of requests that fail. Saturation: The stress on resources to meet the demands of your application. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Step 1 of 5 Bootstrap Terraform and the New Relic provider Start by initializing a working directory and creating a Terraform configuration file: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project $ touch main.tf Next, instruct Terraform to install and use the New Relic provider, by setting the terraform and required_providers blocks in main.tf: terraform { # Require Terraform version 0.13.x (recommended) required_version = \"~> 0.13.0\" # Require the latest 2.x version of the New Relic provider required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.12\" } } } Copy In this code block, you're setting the required version of Terraform to 0.13.x and setting the New Relic provider to the latest 2.x version. Using the right version constraints for your setup will provide better stability with your Terraform runs. Now that you've set your Terraform and New Relic provider versions, you need to configure the New Relic provider. Step 2 of 5 Configure the New Relic provider With terraform all set, configure the New Relic provider with the following items: Your New Relic Account ID. Your New Relic user key. Most user keys begin with the prefix NRAK-. Your New Relic region. Your region is US if your account settings page is located at one.newrelic.com, and EU if your account is located at one.eu.newrelic.com. In main.tf, set those values on the provider: provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy By setting these values on the New Relic provider, you're configuring that provider to make changes on behalf of your account through New Relic APIs. Tip You can also configure the New Relic provider using environment variables. This is a useful way to set default values for your provider configuration. For more information about configuring the New Relic provider, please feel free to check out our official provider documentation. With your New Relic provider configured, initialize Terraform: bash Copy $ terraform init When Terraform finishes installing and registering the New Relic provider, you'll receive a success message and some actionable next steps, such as running terraform plan. Before you can run terraform plan, however, you need to create your resources. Step 3 of 5 Create a New Relic alert policy with the golden signal alerts With the New Relic provider configured and initialized, you can define an alerting strategy for your application. Since you're targeting a specific application, use a newrelic_entity to fetch the application information from New Relic and allow us to reference that data elsewhere in the configuration: data \"newrelic_entity\" \"example_app\" { name = \"Your App Name\" # Must be an exact match to your application name in New Relic domain = \"APM\" # or BROWSER, INFRA, MOBILE, SYNTH, depending on your entity's domain type = \"APPLICATION\" } Copy Next, create a newrelic_alert_policy. Give the policy a dynamic name based on your application's name. This helps specify the scope of the policy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { name = \"Golden Signals - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" } Copy At this point, you should be able to test your configuration with a dry run: bash Copy $ terraform plan You should see output that displays Terraform's execution plan. The plan contains the actions Terraform performs when your run terraform apply: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"golden_signal_policy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"Golden Signals - Your App Name\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In this case, the plan shows you that Terraform will create a new alert policy when you run terraform apply. After verifying the details, execute the plan to provision the alert policy resource in your New Relic account: bash Copy $ terraform apply Every time you apply changes, Terraform asks you to confirm the actions you've told it to run. Type \"yes\". While it's running, Terraform sends logs to your console: bash Copy # Example output of `terraform apply` newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creating... newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy: Creation complete after 1s [id=111222333] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Log in to New Relic and navigate to Alert Policies to confirm that Terraform created your new policy. As you move through the next steps of creating alert conditions, you can run terraform apply after configuring each resource. Refresh your alert policy webpage to see the new resources. Step 4 of 5 Provision alert conditions based on the four golden signals Next, add alert conditions for your application based on the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Apply these alert conditions to the alert policy you created in the previous step. Latency Most folks want to avoid slow response times. You can create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response time of your application rises above five seconds for five minutes: # Response time resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"response_time_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Response Time (Web) - ${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.name}\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"response_time_web\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" priority = \"critical\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Note that you're linking this alert condition to the previously configured alert policy with policy_id. Traffic Traffic represents how much demand is placed on your system at any given moment. Throughput is a metric that measures how much traffic goes to your application. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if the overall response rate of your application falls below five requests per minute for five minutes: # Low throughput resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"throughput_web\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"Low Throughput (Web)\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"throughput_web\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will # trigger after 5 minutes below 5 requests per minute. term { priority = \"critical\" duration = 5 operator = \"below\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy This type of alert is useful when you expect a constant baseline of traffic throughout the day — a drop off in traffic can indicate a problem. Errors If your application's error rate spikes, you need to know about it. Create a newrelic_alert_condition that triggers if your application's error rate rises above 5% for five minutes: # Error percentage resource \"newrelic_alert_condition\" \"error_percentage\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High Error Percentage\" type = \"apm_app_metric\" entities = [data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id] metric = \"error_percentage\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" condition_scope = \"application\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above a 5% error rate. term { duration = 5 operator = \"above\" threshold = \"5\" time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Saturation Saturation represents how \"full\" your service is and can take many forms, such as CPU time, memory allocation, or queue depth. In this example, assume you already have a New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on the hosts serving your application, and you want to configure an alert for when CPU utilization spikes above a certain threshold: # High CPU usage resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"high_cpu\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id name = \"High CPU usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" runbook_url = \"https://www.example.com\" where = \"(`applicationId` = '${data.newrelic_entity.example_app.application_id}')\" # Define a critical alert threshold that will trigger after 5 minutes above 90% CPU utilization. critical { duration = 5 value = 90 time_function = \"all\" } } Copy For the Infrastructure alert, you created a newrelic_infra_alert_condition that triggers if the aggregate CPU usage on these hosts rises above 90% for five minutes. Step 5 of 5 Get notified when an alert triggers Now that you've configured some important alert conditions, add a notification channel to your alert policy to ensure the proper folks get notified when an alert triggers. To do so, use a newrelic_alert_channel. To begin, create an email notification channel to send alert notifications to your email. Use this when you want to notify a specific person or team when alerts are triggered: resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"team_email\" { name = \"example\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"yourawesometeam@example.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy If you want to specify multiple recipients, use a comma-delimited list of emails. Last, but not least, in order to apply the notification channel to your alert policy, create a newrelic_alert_policy_channel: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"golden_signals\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.golden_signal_policy.id channel_ids = [newrelic_alert_channel.team_email.id] } Copy A newrelic_alert_policy_channel links the notification channel you just created to your alert policy. To finalize your golden signal alerts configuration, run terraform apply one last time to make sure all of your configured resources are up to date. Extra Credit new_relic_alert_channel supports several types of notification channels, including email, Slack, and PagerDuty. So, if you want to explore this more, try creating an alert channel for a second channel type, such as Slack: # Slack notification channel resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"slack_notification\" { name = \"slack-example\" type = \"slack\" config { # Use the URL provided in your New Relic Slack integration url = \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX\" channel = \"your-slack-channel-for-alerts\" } } Copy Before you apply this change, you need to add the New Relic Slack App to your Slack account and select a Slack channel to send the notification. With this new alert channel, triggered alerts send notifications to the Slack channel of your choice. Conclusion As your team evaluates the alerting system you’ve put in place, you’ll find that you may need to tweak configuration values, such as the alert threshold and duration. If you manage your Terraform project in a remote repository, you can submit a pull request so your team can review these changes alongside the rest of your code contributions. Tip You may also want to consider automating this process in your CI/CD pipeline. Use Terraform's recommended practices guide to learn more about their recommended workflow and how to evolve your provisioning practices. Congratulations! You're officially practicing observability-as-code. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. In this guide, you learn to use Terraform modules in your New Relic configurations. Specifically, you will create modules, import data, store modules on Github, and manage state remotely Amazon S3. In the video, we review additional steps installing Terraform and set up New Relic alerts. If you need help getting started with Terraform, the Getting started with New Relic and Terraform guide shows how to install Terraform, set up New Relic alerts and a notification channel. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic for your application. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terraform-config && cd terraform-config To follow the examples in this gude, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 5 Creating a Terraform Module Terraform modules allow you to reuse, share, and store your Terraform configurations using version control like Github. In the next steps, you will move your New Relic configurations into a reusable module. First, in your project root, create a new directory to store your modules named modules: bash Copy $ mkdir modules && cd modules In the modules directory, create a new directory for a new module called HostConditions and create a new file named main.tf: bash Copy $ mkdir HostConditions && cd HostConditions $ touch main.tf Remove the two alert conditions from the root project's main.tf file and copy it to the new main.tf file in the HostConditions directory. In the root directory's main.tf file call the new module using a module block: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Initializing modules... $ [output]- HostConditions in $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. $ [output]Error: Unreadable module directory $ [output]Unable to evaluate directory symlink: lstat modules/HostConditions: no such $ [output]file or directory $ [output]Error: Failed to read module directory $ [output]Module directory does not exist or cannot be read. You see an error in your console due to the lack of provider details in your modules directory. To fix the error, create a copy of the root provider.tf in your HostConditions directory : provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-zzzzzz\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Try testing your configurations, run terraform plan and terraform init: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 2, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"cpuhot\": 2: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. $ [output]Error: Reference to undeclared resource on modules/HostConditions/main.tf line 24, in resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" $ [output]\"highDiskUsage\": 24: policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id $ [output]A managed resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" has not been declared $ [output]in module.HostConditions. Terraform init no longer shows an error, but running terraform plan still causes an error to occur. The error is due to the policy id used in the ./modules/HostConditions/provider.tf doesn't exist. A variable is needed to pass into the module. Step 2 of 5 Create a Variable Variables pass details into your module and set default values. First, at the top of your HostConditions provider.tf create a new variable: variable \"providerId\" {} Copy Next, in the resource block, replace the existing policyId with the new variable: var.policy Copy Passing a variable into a module To make a module dynamic, you will pass your variables into the module using the module resource block. In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the policyId variable: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variable to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Now, add more variables and replace the values CPU critical, CPU warning, and disk percent. Then, pass the new variables into the module. Add the new variables to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning {} variable cpu_critical {} variable diskPercent {} Copy Update the alert conditions to use the new variables added in the HostConditons main.tf: resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"cpuhot\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"CPU hot!\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"cpuPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_critical time_function = \"all\" } warning { duration = 5 value = var.cpu_warning time_function = \"all\" } } resource \"newrelic_infra_alert_condition\" \"highDiskUsage\" { policy_id = var.policyId name = \"high disk usage\" type = \"infra_metric\" event = \"SystemSample\" select = \"diskUsedPercent\" comparison = \"above\" where = \"(hostname LIKE '%myhost%')\" critical { duration = 5 value = var.diskPercent time_function = \"all\" } } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. An error message displays due to the missing variable values. Values can be added in the module block or as default values. bash Copy $ terraform plan Adding default values Add default variable values to HostConditions main.tf: variable cpu_warning { default=80} variable cpu_critical { default=90} variable diskPercent { default=60 } Copy Pass variable values using module block In the root directory main.tf, update the module block to add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } Copy Run terraform plan after adding your variables to the module. bash Copy $ terraform plan Step 3 of 5 Reusing a module You can reuse your module connecting to a New Relic policy that already exists. Before you start, in your New Relic account, create a new alert policy named Preexisting Policy. Connecting an existing alert policy First, In your root main.tf file add the data block to import an existing policy: data \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"ExistingPolicy\" { name = \"Preexisting Policy\" } Copy Next, create a second module block name HostConditions2. Add the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"./modules/HostConditions\" policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module and run 'terraform apply' to apply the changes to your New Relic account. The terraform scripts create a new alert policy and two conditions, but it also applies the alert conditions to the Preexisting Policy. Look in your New Relic account at the Preexisting Policy and see alerts conditions added for CPU Hot and High Disk Usage. Step 4 of 5 Store a module in Github After you have created a module, if you want to store the module somewhere other people can use, Github is how you can do it. Create a new Github repo First, inside of your HostModules directory, initialize a new Github repo. Add your main.tf and provider.tf to the stage for commit: bash Copy $ git add main.tf provider.tf $ git commit -m \"init\" Next, using the commands provided in your new repo, push your commit to Github: bash Copy $ git remote add origin <repo_url> $ git branch -M main $ git push -u origin main Using a module saved on Github Check the Github repo and see the main.tf and provider.tf are now in your repo. Copy the GitHub repo's web URL to clone your repo. Update the root main.tf file using GitHub as the source for the HostConditions: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercentage = 66 } module \"HostConditions2\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo_name>\" # Add your repo URL policyId = data.newrelic_alert_policy.ExistingPolicy.id cpu_critical = 87 cpu_warning = 77 diskPercentage = 67 } Copy Run terraform init to initialize the new module. When you run terraform init, Terraform clones the repository locally. Run terraform plan If you need to update your local module with updates made to the git repo, run terraform get -update Step 5 of 5 Manage state remotely in Amazon S3 The state file is the representation that terraform holds about the created resources. The state file is in the root directory, but if deleted or corrupted would cause trouble. Storing the state file remote provides security and allows sharing and remote access. In the provider.tf in the root directory, add a terraform backend block for Amazon S3: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" } } Copy Variables are needed to provide the correct S3 bucket details, and access is required. To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Add the profile to the terraform backend block: terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"<s3_bucket_name>\" key = \"<s3_bucket_key>\" region = \"<s3_bucket_region>\" profile = \"<iam_user_profile_name>\" } } Copy Before saving your state to Amazon S3, destroy the current configurations to start from a clean slate: bash Copy $ terraform destroy Initialize Terraform, run Terraform init: bash Copy $ terraform init In the terminal, the output shows the backend initialized as S3. Delete the local state as it is not needed bash Copy $ rm terraform.* Run terraform apply to apply your Terraform configuration changes. bash Copy $ terraform apply The state file is now stored in S3 instead of locally. Look in your S3 bucket and see the terraform state exists. Conclusion Congratulations! You're using modules to make your terraform configuratiions more flexible. Review the New Relic Terraform provider documentation to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. Terragrunt is a thin wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state. In this guide, you will use Terragrunt to generate your Terraform configurations, create files with Terragrunt, and reuse the Terragrunt configuration to manage multiple environments. Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't deployed a New Relic open source agent yet, install New Relic Infrastructure agent for your host. Also, install the Terraform CLI. Start by initializing a working directory: You will also need to install Terragrunt to follow this guide: bash Copy $ brew install terragrunt To follow the examples in this guide, the accompanying example code is available on GitHub bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/jsbnr/nr-terraform-intro-example.git Step 1 of 6 Create a new configuration Terragrunt is a wrapper that provides extra tooling for your Terraform configurations. In the next steps, you will create a new configuration using Terragrunt, Terraform, and New Relic. Start by initializing a working directory: bash Copy $ mkdir terragrunt-config && cd terragrunt-config In the new directory, create a terragrunt.hcl file, create a ./src directory, and create a ./environments directory: bash Copy $ touch terragrunt.hcl $ mkdir src $ mkdir environments Inside of your environments folder, create a folder named dev. In the ./src directory, create a main.tf and provider.tf files: bash Copy $ mkdir environments/dev $ touch src/main.tf $ touch src/provider.tf In the provider.tf file add the appropriate Terraform and New Relic provider configuration information: terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } Copy In the main.tf add a New Relic alert policy named DemoPolicy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Copy In the ./environments/dev directory create a new file named terragrunt.hcl bash Copy $ cd ./environments/dev/ $ touch terragrunt.hcl Within the dev folder update the terragrunt.hcl file by adding the following include statement. The include statement tells Terragrunt to use any .hcl confgiuration files it finds in parent folders. include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } Copy Next, add a Terraform block to provide Terragrunt with a Terraform source reference. terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Now you need to configure the provider with your New Relic account details. You will need your New Relic user API key and account ID. provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = 12345 # Your New Relic account ID api_key = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic user key region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you have a single account: The account ID is displayed on the API keys page. If your organization has multiple accounts: From one.newrelic.com, select Entity explorer and use the account selector dropdown near the top of the page. Tip Documentation about the New Relic provider is provided on the Terraform doc site. Update the provider.tf file to define the New Relic account variables that will help keep the Terraform configuration dynamic. variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy In your terminal, change directories to the environments/dev folder and run the command terragrunt init: bash Copy $ terragrunt init Terraform init sets up a bit of context, sets up environment variables, and then runs terraform init. You will see the following output: bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. [terragrunt] [/Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev] 2021/02/02 13:30:31 Copying lock file [output] from /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev/.terragrunt-cache/e-PoBgWhdv3v8QGOtDQxS_WeYu4/ 69zjIFUfApJiUt8gFmi-6-dcPe8/.terraform.lock.hcl to /Users/jsius/Sites/deco/terragrunt-config/environments/dev Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy $ terragrunt plan Terragrunt starts to run but pauses to ask for the inputs to the New Relic account variables added to the provider.tf file. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2/02 13:32:08 Running command: terraform plan var.newrelic_account_id Enter a value: Interrupt received. Exit the terragrunt plan process with CTRL+C . In the environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl file, add an inputs block to provide the values for your New Relic account variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy The updated terragrunt.hcl only has the include, terraform, and inputs block include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Now, when you run terragrunt plan, Terragrunt will provide the input block's values, no longer prompting the command line for values. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ An execution plan has been generated and is shown below. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Run terragrunt apply. After Terraform finishes process, check your New Relic account for the new Demo Policy. Step 2 of 6 Adding to your configuration Now that you have a basic New Relic configuration created, add configurations built in the Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides in this step. Tip If you haven't done the previous developer guides, you can copy the configurations for this section from the Terragrunt Intro Github Repo. Update the main.tf to include the additional terraform configurations. Update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy You have added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. To clone the module from GitHub, run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply. After Terraform is done processing, You will see your Demo Policy now has two conditions in your New Relic account and one alert channel attached. Step 3 of 6 Using your Environment as a Terragrunt Variable Using Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you are running to the name of the data you are creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create a new input for env_name inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy in the main.tf file add a new variable for 'env_name' variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Using string interpolation, add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks. resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to the configuration name. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Currently, the environment variable name is hardcoded into the root terragrunt.hcl file. You want to avoid having your variables hardcoded, using a terragrunt built-in function will pass the value. In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use the path_relative_to_include() built-in function and pass the value has the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output, the env_name variable will have the entire ./environments/dev/ path. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Next, update the terragrunt.hcl to only include 'dev' as the env_name variable. Adding a locals block creates a local variable, using the replace built-in function will remove the unwanted parts of the relative path, and update the inputs block to use the local variable. locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Run terragrunt plan. Looking at the output the env_name variable will now have 'dev:' added. Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations. bash Copy # Example output ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Step 4 of 6 Storing the State Remotely At the moment, the state file is local. The next steps will update your Terraform configurations to remove the local state file and use a file stored remotely in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, various state files will need to be store in separate S3 buckets, not to override each other. Terragrunt allows you to generate files on the fly. Adding the remote_state block into the root level terragrunt.hcl file, you will generate a new file named backend.tf. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"my-terraform-state\" key = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true } } Copy After adding the remote_state block, you will need to give the configuration for the S3 bucket that will store the Terraform state. Tip To give access to the S3 bucket in your Amazon account, create an IAM user. Give the IAM user access to the S3 bucket storing the terraform state. Now, update the remote_state block to provide your S3 bucket and update the key to use the local environment variable created previously. remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Next, run terragrunt plan. If you look in the Amazon S3 bucket, you will see a folder named envs. Within the envs folder is a directory called devs containing terraform.tfstate file. Tip To see the files created by Terragrunt, look inside of the ./environments/dev directory. There is a hidden directory named terragrunt-cache. Within the terragrunt-cache directory, you will see the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Step 5 of 6 Creating a New Environment Now that you have a working configuration for your dev environment, you will create a new environment reusing the dev configurations in the next steps. In the environments directory, create a new folder names nonprod. In the nonprod folder, create a new terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl In the nonprod terragrunt.hcl file copy over the configuration from the environment terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you are using a different account for your nonprod environment, you can update the inputs with a new New Relic account ID and API key. Inside of your nonprod directory, run terragrunt init then run terragrunt apply. In the output, you will see Terraform has created a new set of resources. The new resources should have the nonprod name prefixed. Step 6 of 6 Terragrunt has created two environments, but there is no difference between them other than the name. Adding variables in the configurations allows your configurations to be more dynamic. In the next steps, you will add variables to your configurations. In the main.tf add new variables for the Host Conditions modules cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage values: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy In the main.tf update the HostConditions module values to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Run terragrunt plan. In the output, the HostConditions values have changed to use the variable defaults. Next, you want to pass the values into your environment configurations by adding the inputs block variables. In the nonprod/terragrunt.hcl file, add the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy Run terragrunt apply. In your New Relic account, you will see a new policy with configurations changed based on the environment. Conclusion Congratulations! You've used Terragrunt to generate your New Relic configurations and manage multiple environments. Review the Terragrunt Intro Example, New Relic Terraform provider documentation, and Terragrunt quick start to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "You can manage your alert notification channels using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. Get notification channels The notificationChannels query allows you to paginate through all of your notification channels per account. You can also use the notificationChannel query to get a specific notification channel by its ID. Tip Note that certain secret fields (for example passwords or API keys) are obfuscated in the returned fields. List all notification channels for an account This example returns every field for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, up to the page limit of 200. Note how we use inline fragments to refer to the specific fields on the concrete types implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { config { integrationUrl } } ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { config { baseUrl basicAuth { password username } customHttpHeaders { name value } customPayloadBody customPayloadType } } ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { config { key routeKey } } ... on AlertsUserNotificationChannel { config { userId } } ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { config { apiKey } } ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { config { apiKey dataCenterRegion recipients tags teams } } ... on AlertsHipChatNotificationChannel { config { authToken baseUrl roomId } } ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { config { emails includeJson } } ... on AlertsCampfireNotificationChannel { config { room subdomain token } } } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Paginate through notification channels with cursor pagination If a given account's list of notification channels exceeds the 200 channel page limit, you can use the pagination cursor to retrieve additional pages. With cursor pagination, you continue to request additional pages using the nextCursor until that field returns empty in the response. An empty nextCursor signals that you have reached the end of the result set. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"notificationChannels\": { \"channels\": [ { \"id\": \"250\", \"name\": \"Channel 1\", \"type\": \"SLACK\" }, { \"id\": \"713\", \"name\": \"Channel 2\", \"type\": \"WEBHOOK\" }, // ... +198 more notification channels in reality ], \"nextCursor\": \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\", \"totalCount\": 268 } } } } } } Copy In your next request, provide the cursor like so, updating each subsequent request to return the updated cursor, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels(cursor: \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\") { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Find a specific notification channel by id If you have a specific notification channel's ID, the API allows you to look it up directly. Note that because the specific channel is a concrete type implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface, you may need to specify certain fields using the ... on syntax for inline fragments. In this example, we are retrieving a Slack channel: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannel(id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id name type ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } } } } } } Copy Create a notification channel In order to create an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to create (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Once a notification channel has been created, it can be associated with one or more alert policies. Once associated, those channels will receive notifications from those policies when conditions are violated. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only create a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Create an email notification channel An example create mutation for an email notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { emails: [\"email@example.com\"], includeJson: true, name: \"Some Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type config { emails includeJson } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an OpsGenie notification channel An example create mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { apiKey: \"api-key-from-opsgenie\", dataCenterRegion: US, name: \"OpsGenie notification channel name\", recipients: [\"user@example.com\"], tags: [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"], teams: [\"team1\", \"team2\"] } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey teams tags recipients dataCenterRegion } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a PagerDuty notification channel An example create mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty notification channel name\", apiKey: \"api-key-from-pagerduty\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Slack notification channel An example create mutation for a Slack notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack notification channel name\", teamChannel: \"#team-channel\", url: \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/FAKE/MOREFAKE/IMAGINARYEXAMPLEURLCHUNK\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type config { teamChannel url } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a VictorOps notification channel An example create mutation for a VictorOps notification channel: mutation {

alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { integrationUrl: \"https://company.instance.xmatters.com/api/xm/v<version>/...\", name: \"xMatters notification channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type config { integrationUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Update a notification channel In order to update an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to change (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Consistent with other GraphQL APIs, you can update a single field on the channel without knowing anything other than the channel's ID. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only update a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Update an email notification channel An example update mutation for an email notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { name: \"Updated Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an OpsGenie notification channel An example update mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { name: \"OpsGenie updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a PagerDuty notification channel An example update mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Slack notification channel An example update mutation for a Slack notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a VictorOps notification channel An example update mutation for a VictorOps notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { name: \"VictorOps updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Webhook notification channel An example update mutation for a Webhook notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { name: \"Webhook updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an xMatters notification channel An example update mutation for an xMatters notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { name: \"xMatters updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Delete a notification channel You can delete a notification channel with only the account ID and the channel ID. Note that deleting a channel dissociates it from all policies, meaning that no further notifications will be sent to that channel. mutation { alertsNotificationChannelDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Associate channels to a policy Creating an alert notification channel is not enough: Once the channel has been created, it needs to be associated to one or more policies. Once associated to a policy, the channel can recieve alert notifications when conditions on that policy go into violation. In this example, we associate two channels with a policy: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsAddToPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Dissociate a channel from a policy In those instances where a notification channel has outlived its usefulness (for example, an email list that has been retired), the time has come to dissociate that channel from the policy (or policies) that are sending alert notifications to it. This API call leaves the channel itself intact, but removes it from the specified policy. In this example, we are removing two channels from a policy (leaving any others in place), and getting back confirmation that those two channel IDs have been removed: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsRemoveFromPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Tip Removing an alert notification channel from a policy does not delete the policy because it might be used by other policies. On the other hand, deleting a channel will cause all associated channels to stop sending alert notifications to that channel.",

      "body": "Every time you deploy an application, you hope that it's efficient and error-free. The reality, however, is usually quite different. You might introduce a bug in a release, overlook an edge case, or rely on a broken dependency. These issues, and others, can result in bad user experiences. In this guide, you: Use the open-source New Relic demo-deployer to spin up the infrastructure for Acme Telco Lite, a fictional company. This demo scenario is part of our Demo Catalog and will simulate real-world issues in a controlled, demo environment Use New Relic to understand those issues from the perspective of a Telco Lite developer Use the deployer to tear down the resources you create Welcome to Acme Telco Lite! Acme Telco Lite is a mock telecom business that maintains an eCommerce website for its customers. The site's architecture has eight, interconnected microservices, plus a simulator: The simulator isn't part of the Telco Lite infrastructure, but it is part of the demo deployment. It runs scenarios against the application to create web traffic and generate interesting data in New Relic. Set up your environment Before you begin, follow the Prerequisites guide from the deployer's GitHub repository for a detailed walkthrough of how to set up your environment. For this guide, you can choose between Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host your deployment. The guide steps you through: Installing Docker & pulling the demo-deployer image locally Creating a user config file containing credentials for New Relic and your cloud provider Downloading a .pem key file (if your cloud provider is AWS) Once you're all set up, deploy Acme Telco Lite. Deploy Telco Lite It's time to deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services using demo-deployer. Copy the url for the demo that corresponds to the cloud provider you chose when you set up your environment: AWS Telco Lite Demo Azure Telco Lite Demo GCP Telco Lite Demo Follow the Deployment guide in the Demo Catalog repository for a thorough explanation of how to use the deployer in a local Docker environment. When you run the deployment script, make sure to pass the url you copied for <demo-url>. Tip Since Telco Lite contains several services, the deployment can take over half an hour. When the deloyer is finished, you should see some output stating that the deployment was successful: bash Copy [INFO] Executing Deployment [✔] Parsing and validating Deployment configuration success [✔] Provisioner success [✔] Installing On-Host instrumentation success [✔] Installing Services and instrumentations success [INFO] Deployment successful!

View your services With your services running in the cloud, log in to New Relic and select APM from the top navigation to see how your services are holding up: Yikes! The alerts, high response times, and red-colored indicators suggest things aren't well. Use New Relic to diagnose these issues, which are simultaneously affecting your services: Issue 1: The Warehouse Portal has abnormally high response times Issue 2: Multiple services are raising error alerts Tip Don't worry if you don't see all the same alerts. The simulator triggers issues at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. Tear down Telco Lite When you're finished diagnosing all the issues effecting Telco Lite, follow the Teardown guide in the deployer's repository to tear down the services you created in your cloud provider. If you're still exploring, don't tear down your services, or you'll have to deploy them again later. Conclusion Congratulations, you're done! Throughout this tutorial, you: Used the demo-deployer to deploy Telco Lite to the cloud Used New Relic to investigate simulated issues in Telco Lite services Tore down all the infrastructural resources you created throughout this tutorial Hopefully, you learned a lot about using New Relic to investigate issues in your services. To get your hands on more features of New Relic, pick another demo from the catalog and spin it up with the deployer!",

      "info": "Learn how to use New Relic to diagnose error alerts in your services.",
      "body": "Use New Relic to understand why some services are raising alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin: Learn about the infrastructure of Telco Lite Set up your local environment Deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services When you're ready, start your journey by observing the error alerts in your services. Step 1 of 8 Log in to New Relic One and select APM from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal have opened critical violations for high error percentages: Tip If you don't see all the same alerts, don't worry. The simulated issues happen at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. The deployment has created an alert condition for cases where a service's error percentage rises above 10% for 5 minutes or longer. A critical violation means that the service's conditions violate that threshold. Begin your investigation by selecting the Telco-Web Portal service name. Step 2 of 8 You're now on the web portal's APM summary page. The top graph, Web transactions time, shows you the service's response times. By default, it also displays periods of critical violation. On the right-hand side of the view, Application activity shows when violations opened and closed: From the left-hand navigation, select Events > Errors to learn more about the errors: At the bottom of the view, the Errors table shows you what errors occurred in the service along with number of times each error occurred. In this scenario, the only error in the service has the following message: bash Copy An error occurred during a downstream request to http://35.182.223.70:7001/api/inventory detail:response code 500 This is a helpful message that explains that the web portal made a request to another service, raised an error, and responded with a response code of 500, indicating an Internal server error. Since this message tells you that the error occurred while the web portal was making an outbound request, use distributed tracing to better understand the issue. Select Monitor > Distributed tracing from the left-hand navigation. Step 3 of 8 Distributed tracing provides end-to-end information about a request. In this case, you're looking for a request to the web portal that raised an error, so that you can better understand what happened during that request. Filter the table, by selecting the Errors column header twice, to order by descending counts: Select the first row in the table: This trace gives a lot of information about what happened with the request once the web portal received it. One of the things that the trace reveals is that the web portal made a GET request to Telco-Login Service and received an error. The trace indicates an error by coloring the text red. Select the row (called a span) to see more information about the request to the login service: Expand Error details to see the error message: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic Interesting! This message says that, at the time that the web portal made the GET request to the login service, the login service was not ready to accept traffic. Inspect the login service to dive further into the root cause of these cascading errors. Return to the APM page, and select Telco-Login Service. Step 4 of 8 Notice that the APM summary for Telco-Login Service has similar red flags to the ones in the web portal: Web transactions time has a red error indicator, and Application activity shows critical violations. More than that, the times that the errors occurred in both services match up (around 10:53 AM, in this example). Step 5 of 8 Web transactions time, in APM, shows that requests to the login service spend all their time in Java code. So, in the left-hand navigation, open Monitor > JVMs: Java Virtual Machines, or JVMs, run Java processes, such as those used by the login service. This view shows resource graphs for each JVM your service uses. Change the timeslice to look at data for the last 3 hours, so you can get a better idea of how the service has been behaving: Notice, in Heap memory usage, that the line for Used Heap rises consistently over 30 minute intervals. About two-thirds of the way through each interval, the line for Committed Heap (the amount of JVM heap memory dedicated for use by Java processes) quickly rises to accommodate the increasing memory demands. This graph indicates that the Java process is leaking memory. Step 6 of 8 Your Java process is leaking memory, but you need to understand the extent of the leak's impact. Navigate to the login service's host infrastructure view to dive a little deeper. First, go to the Telco-Login Service summary page and turn off Show new view: Then, scroll to the bottom of the page, and select the host's name: Right now, you can only select the host's name from the old version of the UI (we're working on it). So, make sure you toggle off Show new view. In this infrastructure view, Memory Used % for Telco-Authentication-host consistently climbs from around 60% to around 90% over 30-minute intervals, matching the intervals in the JVM's heap memory usage graph: Therefore, the memory leak effects the login service's entire host. Click and drag on Memory Used % to narrow the timeslice to one of the peaks: Now, compare this graph with the login service's Errors graph to see how they relate. Step 7 of 8 Open New Relic in a new tab. From APM, select Telco-Login Service. Then, navigate to Events > Errors. By comparing these graphs, you see that the memory percentage reached its peak at 10:25 AM (in this example) and then dropped off. You also see that errors started occurring in the login service just after that, at 10:26 AM. The message for those errors is the same one you saw earlier: bash Copy java.lang.Exception: The application is not yet ready to accept traffic This suggests that the memory leaks cause the application to fail for a time. To understand the error a bit more, select the error class from the table at the bottom of the view: The stack trace shows that the service raised an UnhandledException from a function called EnsureAppIsStarted: With the information you've collected so far, you can conclude that Telco-Login Service's Java code has a memory leak. Also, the login service restarts the application when it runs out of memory, and it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests while the app is restarting. You also know the login service is effecting the web portal, because that is what introduced you to this problem, but does the issue effect any other services? Step 8 of 8 Visualize service dependencies using service maps. First, navigate back to APM, and from Telco-Login Service, select Monitor > Service map: Both Telco-Web Portal and Telco-Warehouse Portal depend on Telco-Login Service. So, when the login service goes down, you start seeing errors in both portals. Extra Credit Use the same steps you used to investigate issues in the web portal to confirm there are issues in the warehouse portal. Conclusion At the end of your investigation, you discovered: Telco-Login Service and Telco-Web Portal raise alerts during critical violations The login service's Java processes leak memory When the login service's host, Telco-Authentication-host, runs out of memory, it restarts the login application While the login application is restarting, it raises an UnhandledException when it receives requests When the web portal and the warehouse portal make requests to the login service while it's restarting, they receive errors and raise errors of their own Now, as a Telco Lite developer, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the memory leak. Congratulations! Learn more about using New Relic by diagnosing other issues. If this is your last issue, tear down all the Telco Lite services.",

      "body": "With the data explorer you can navigate all your data visually, without any NRQL knowledge. Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. Why it matters Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries. With the data explorer you can: Access events and metrics data in a quick, intuitive way. Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon. See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc. Drill down into data with filters. Add your searches to a dashboard in a click. Understand how NRQL works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data. Tip Want to switch to New Relic One from Insights? See our transition guide. Query your data To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and At the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. At the Browse data dropdown, select Events or Metrics. The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the Logs and Traces query interfaces to explore those. You can also access the query builder any time by clicking on the tab. Use the data explorer The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c). To use the data explorer: Define the scope of the exploration: select the account and data type (metric or event) you want to browse. Select the time range using the time picker. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable. Explore your events Event type Lists all available events for the selected account. By default, events are sorted by Name. Plot Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected. The first item on the list is count( * ), which is not an attribute. It calculates the count of the selected event. By default attributes are sorted by Name. Select the function that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function Average. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are sorted by Name. Explore your metrics To explore APM timeslice data, select AppID, AppName, or EntityGuid as dimensions (or group by those dimensions). Otherwise, you'll get aggregated data for all entities. Metric Lists all the metrics available for the selected account. By default, metrics are sorted by Name. Dimensions Lists all the dimensions of the metric previously selected. Dimensions are string values that provide information on the metric. They represent the cardinality, that is, the uniqueCount of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute. By default, dimensions are by Name. Important We use the metric system (including metric SI prefixes) to display our units. Visualize and refine your exploration The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right. Refine your exploration, or share your chart At the working space you can see: Querying area The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted. If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built. The different parts of the query are: [ EVENTS ONLY]FROM: the event selected on the first block. SELECT: the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function. GROUP BY: represents the FACET clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension. LIMIT: type in the amount of values you want to see. WHERE: use this field to further filter results. This input plots n values. Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the x. NRQL query display You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the time range selected with the time picker. Tip Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From the data explorer you can access the query builder to edit the query. Chart area By default data is displayed on a line chart. You can easily change to Area chart, Pie chart, and Bar chart using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' raw data as a table, or as in JSON format. If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one. Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration. Share and export You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the Options menu on the top right corner. You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users. Use cases See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer. Discover your new data I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague. Validate your data I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful. Troubleshooting data issues I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. Transitioning from Insights Switching to using New Relic One dashboards from our deprecated Insights dashboards? See our transition guide. If you're using the Insights Dashboard API, we have have a migration guide that will help you transition to using the new API. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By duplicating an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Duplicate a dashboard Duplicate any dashboard by clicking the Duplicate dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can duplicate any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the duplicate will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your duplicated dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can duplicate it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. Everything but the metadata is hidden. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by duplicating another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

A Nerdpack is a package that contains all the files that make up a New Relic One application or visualization. Nerdpacks include files for metadata, Nerdlets, assets, and more. To create a Nerdpack, use the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack When nr1 prompts for a component name, use \"ab-test\" and watch the tool create the foundations of your Nerdpack. Once it's finished, explore the files it created for you. Root directory At the root level, you have a directory called ab-test. Everything inside this directory is part of the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls ab-test README.md nerdlets nr1.json package.json launchers node_modules package-lock.json Readme.md provides instructions for creating Nerdpack elements and serving your application locally. This and nr1 --help are useful if you forget how to interact with your Nerdpack using the command line tool. Javascript files package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules are important for running your JavaScript application, but aren't unique to Nerdpacks. You can learn about these modules from JavaScript courses should you need to tweak them. For now, take a look at nr1.json, one of the most relevant files in this directory. Metadata file nr1.json is the Nerdpack's metadata file, containing a schema type, unique identifier, a display name, and a description. Since you’re building a New Relic One application for running and analyzing A/B tests, update the package's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and set the description to \"A/B test your application using New Relic One\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"311bcd0c-f7eb-4285-afed-4219179bf91d\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"A/B test your application using New Relic One.\" } nr1.json Copy It's good to describe your application's purpose, especially if you're going to publish your application for others to use. Next, look at the launchers and nerdlets subdirectories. Launchers launchers is a directory because you can create multiple launchers for your New Relic One application. nr1 create only created one launcher for your Nerdpack and called it \"ab-test-launcher\". Inside its directory, there are two files: icon.png is an image that represents the application nr1.json is the launcher's metadata file Use \"A/B Test Launcher\" for the launcher's displayName and \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\" for the description in nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"ab-test-launcher\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test Launcher\", \"description\": \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\" } launchers/ab-test-launcher/nr1.json Copy Notice that the launcher has a rootNerdletId. This identifies the Nerdlet that the launcher opens when it's selected. This Nerdpack has only one Nerdlet, called ab-test-nerdlet, but some Nerdpacks may have multiple. Make sure that you set the rootNerdletId to the Nerdlet you want the launcher to open. Nerdlets The nerdlets directory contains all the Nerdlets that make up your New Relic One application. Since ab-test-nerdlet is the only Nerdlet in this Nerdpack, there is only one subdirectory. In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, there are three files: index.js is the JavaScript file that contains your Nerdlet component styles.scss holds the Sass stylesheet for your Nerdlet nr1.json contains the Nerdlet's metadata Update your Nerdlet's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and description to \"Control and view results of your A/B test\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"Control and view results of your A/B test\" } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Now, you've customized your Nerdpack, Nerdlet, and launcher with informative display names and descriptions, but what does your application actually do? Check out index.js to see what your default Nerdlet looks like: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, ab-test-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you have AbTestNerdletNerdlet, which nr1 created for you. It's a React component that renders a first-level welcome heading. Because this is the root Nerdlet, as specified in your launcher's nr1.json file, when you click on your launcher in the New Relic platform, the launcher will open a view that displays this heading. Tip In this lesson, you used nr1 create to create a Nerdpack, complete with a launcher and a Nerdlet. If you want to create another Nerdlet or Launcher in your Nerdpack, you can also do that with nr1 create: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdlet $ nr1 create --type launcher You can even skip the --type flag and select an option from a list: bash Copy $ nr1 create ? What kind of component do you want to create? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit. nerdpack ❯ nerdlet - create a/an Nerdlet Nerdpack item inside your Nerdpack. launcher catalog visualization In the next lesson, you'll learn how to serve your Nerdpack locally and see your app in action!

      "body": "If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin Before you begin, we recommend first reading about permissions. To start building, you must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request.

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are four options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, IncidentIntelligence, or ProactiveDetection. For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost.

In other words, you can do either procedure first. The key point is that if you're trying to give a user access to a role or an account that they don't yet have, they won't have that access until they're both a) in a group and b) that group has the correct access grant (access to a specific role on a specific account). There are two ways to add users: With the user management UI (described below) With automated user management, also known as SCIM provisioning: use of this method means that groups are defined in your identity provider and so you can't edit a user's group from the New Relic UI. To add users from the UI: From the top right of the New Relic UI, click the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Relevant tips: For how to bulk edit users' user type, see Edit user type. When choosing a group, you can choose either one of our default groups or a custom group that you've defined an access grant for. For more on creating access grants, keep reading. View available accounts When thinking about creating access grants for granting access to different accounts, it can help you to understand what accounts there are in your organization. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant access to accounts and roles Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic: by creating an access grant, you assign a group access to a) a specific role on b) a specific account. By default, organizations on the New Relic One user model have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. To view existing access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. Even if you haven't created any custom access grants, you will see the default-created grants there that are present for our default groups. This is what you might see when you go to the Organization and access UI and view groups. The default available groups of Admin and User have access grants automatically created that grant users in those groups access to the roles associated with those groups and to the initial account those users were added in. To create a new access grant that gives a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're logged in with an original user model record, or because you don't have the ability to manage users. For more on such factors, see Factors affecting access. Choose one of the following: Existing: If there is already a group you want to add an access grant to, you can use this. For example, if you want to gives users in the default Admin or User group access to new accounts, you might choose this and then select the Admin Default or Admin User role. New: If you need to create a new group, choose this. You'll also need to choose the authentication domain that group is inside of (for an explanation of what \"Default\" means, see Default groups. If your organization strategy requires a good amount of restrictions over access to accounts and access to roles, you'll probably need to create a good amount of access grants. Next, under Access grant, you'll choose one of following: Account: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are account-scoped. These are the roles that have to do with using and configuring our platform features (and not about organization and user management). Organization: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are organization-scoped. These are the roles that govern organization- and user management. (Note that these users must also already belong to an account-scoped role. This is true for most users but if it's not, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Select the Role you want to assign. Roles are organization-wide, so regardless of the authentication domain you're in, you have access to our standard roles and any custom roles you've created. For tips on selecting roles, see the tips after these instructions. Select the Account you want to add access to from the dropdown. If you don't see an account that you'd expect to see, this may be for a few reasons. One is that you yourself don't have the proper permissions for that account. Another is that that account is not actually in your organization. For more information, see Factors affecting access. If you are still having problems, talk to your account representative. If you want to continue adding more grants for that same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. When you're done, if your users are already in the group you've added the grant to, they should have access within a few minutes (although for EU region New Relic accounts, this can take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true if you just created an access grant with a new group), you'll need to go to the User management UI and add that group to those users. Some tips for using this UI: Note that if a user has the organization-scoped Organization manager and/or Authentication domain manager roles, which is true of users in the default Admin group, those users will always have those capabilities because those are organization-scoped abilities. This means that when you go to add those users to another account, you only have to add an account-scoped role, and not an organization-scoped role. In other words, once the users in a group have those organization-scoped roles, they will always have them in that organization unless removed. When selecting from amongst our standard roles, it's important to understand the difference between All product admin and Standard user. In short, All product admin is more popular a choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure them, you'd choose Standard user. If your users are managed via automated user management, there are some restrictions that may apply. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the User management UI to add users to groups, because groups are managed and imported from your identity provider. If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. Create custom role When creating an access grant, you can use our standard roles, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Review the list of available capabilities and decide which ones your custom role needs. For more information about how roles and capabilities work, see Capabilities. Once you're finished creating a custom role, you will probably want to use it in a new access grant. Add users to groups In the user management UI, you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to. Your users only have access to the access grants associated with the groups they've been added to. To view users and see their groups: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic user versus full user) Note that there are limits around how many times full users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span.",

      "body": "When you connect your data to New Relic, we process what we receive and apply data dropping and transformation rules. Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and any Log_<value> custom data partition created Metric group: LoggingBytes Log records are stored into the Log event type by default. Additional custom data partitions will create new event types, which are always prefixed with Log_ and will be counted as part of the overall set of log data stored. With LogExtendedRecord, log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. As of September 2021, log storage as blobs replaces LogExtendedRecord. With blob storage, NRDB can store up to 128,000 bytes for any attribute, not just messages. For more information, see our blobs documentation for logs. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent. You are not charged for DistributedTraceSummary events. Browser:EventLog Browser Browser:JSErrors PcvPerf (PageView timing) Browser events Metric group: BrowserEventsBytes Lambda Serverless Metric group: ServerlessBytes Break down data to see what's contributing to your ingest You can inspect your data ingest to gain more information about your ingest health. This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the account switcher. account switcher If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account organization, you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: *EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) *CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. *EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, as well as the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing plan, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our Full Stack Observability pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Tip Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

      "body": "To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users' configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { \"YourNerdpackUuid\": { \"collection-1\": { \"document-1-of-collection-1\": \"{\\\"lastNumber\\\": 42, \\\"another\\\": [1]}\", \"document-2-of-collection-1\": \"\\\"userToken\\\"\" // ... }, \"another-collection\": { \"fruits\": \"[\\\"pear\\\", \\\"apple\\\"]\" // ... } // ... } } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Caution NerdStorage is not encrypted. Do not store secrets, API keys, personal access tokens or license keys here. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,500 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 1024 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model. Requirements Some notes on requirements: This tutorial is for users on our New Relic One user model. Creating access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we recommend you check out: Understand what an access grant is Videos that show the user management UI in action This tutorial will walk you through how to: Add users View available accounts Grant groups access to roles and accounts Create custom roles Add users to groups Add users Adding users to New Relic is a separate process from creating access grants. In other words, you can do either procedure first. The key point is that if you're trying to give a user access to a role or an account that they don't yet have, they won't have that access until they're both a) in a group and b) that group has the correct access grant (access to a specific role on a specific account). There are two ways to add users: With the user management UI (described below) With automated user management, also known as SCIM provisioning: use of this method means that groups are defined in your identity provider and so you can't edit a user's group from the New Relic UI. To add users from the UI: From the top right of the New Relic UI, click the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Relevant tips: For how to bulk edit users' user type, see Edit user type. When choosing a group, you can choose either one of our default groups or a custom group that you've defined an access grant for. For more on creating access grants, keep reading. View available accounts When thinking about creating access grants for granting access to different accounts, it can help you to understand what accounts there are in your organization. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant access to accounts and roles Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic: by creating an access grant, you assign a group access to a) a specific role on b) a specific account. By default, organizations on the New Relic One user model have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. To view existing access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. Even if you haven't created any custom access grants, you will see the default-created grants there that are present for our default groups. This is what you might see when you go to the Organization and access UI and view groups. The default available groups of Admin and User have access grants automatically created that grant users in those groups access to the roles associated with those groups and to the initial account those users were added in. To create a new access grant that gives a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're logged in with an original user model record, or because you don't have the ability to manage users. For more on such factors, see Factors affecting access. Choose one of the following: Existing: If there is already a group you want to add an access grant to, you can use this. For example, if you want to gives users in the default Admin or User group access to new accounts, you might choose this and then select the Admin Default or Admin User role. New: If you need to create a new group, choose this. You'll also need to choose the authentication domain that group is inside of (for an explanation of what \"Default\" means, see Default groups. If your organization strategy requires a good amount of restrictions over access to accounts and access to roles, you'll probably need to create a good amount of access grants. Next, under Access grant, you'll choose one of following: Account: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are account-scoped. These are the roles that have to do with using and configuring our platform features (and not about organization and user management). Organization: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are organization-scoped. These are the roles that govern organization- and user management. (Note that these users must also already belong to an account-scoped role. This is true for most users but if it's not, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Select the Role you want to assign. Roles are organization-wide, so regardless of the authentication domain you're in, you have access to our standard roles and any custom roles you've created. For tips on selecting roles, see the tips after these instructions. Select the Account you want to add access to from the dropdown. If you don't see an account that you'd expect to see, this may be for a few reasons. One is that you yourself don't have the proper permissions for that account. Another is that that account is not actually in your organization. For more information, see Factors affecting access. If you are still having problems, talk to your account representative. If you want to continue adding more grants for that same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. When you're done, if your users are already in the group you've added the grant to, they should have access within a few minutes (although for EU region New Relic accounts, this can take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true if you just created an access grant with a new group), you'll need to go to the User management UI and add that group to those users. Some tips for using this UI: Note that if a user has the organization-scoped Organization manager and/or Authentication domain manager roles, which is true of users in the default Admin group, those users will always have those capabilities because those are organization-scoped abilities. This means that when you go to add those users to another account, you only have to add an account-scoped role, and not an organization-scoped role. In other words, once the users in a group have those organization-scoped roles, they will always have them in that organization unless removed. When selecting from amongst our standard roles, it's important to understand the difference between All product admin and Standard user. In short, All product admin is more popular a choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure them, you'd choose Standard user. If your users are managed via automated user management, there are some restrictions that may apply. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the User management UI to add users to groups, because groups are managed and imported from your identity provider. If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. Create custom role When creating an access grant, you can use our standard roles, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Review the list of available capabilities and decide which ones your custom role needs. For more information about how roles and capabilities work, see Capabilities. Once you're finished creating a custom role, you will probably want to use it in a new access grant. Add users to groups In the user management UI, you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to. Your users only have access to the access grants associated with the groups they've been added to. To view users and see their groups: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access.

      "body": "For accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan, we provide a View your usage UI for understanding billing-related usage and a Manage your data UI for managing billing-related data. Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are four options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, IncidentIntelligence, or ProactiveDetection. For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost. This is an estimate of costs to date, not your monthly invoice. For more attributes, see the data dictionary.",

      "body": "For users on our New Relic One user model, we provide various user management features, including the ability to: Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to user groups Create custom user groups Grant user groups access to specific roles and accounts Important This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic user versus full user) Note that there are limits around how many times full users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

      "body": "Publish your Nerdpack, whether it's still in development, ready for testing, or stable, to share it with others. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions When you publish your Nerdpack, it's registered with the Instant Observability catalog. From there, some users can subscribe to your Nerdpack. Subscribing users need to have: Access to the account that published the Nerdpack The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Update your package version You can only publish a package version to the Instant Observabiltiy catalog one time. For example, you can't publish two instances of version 1.0.0. So, each time you want to deploy a new version of your code, you need to increment its version in the Nerdpack's package.json file: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy Tip Nerdpack versions follow semantic versioning. Read the documentation to learn more. Generate a UUID for your Nerdpack If you built your Nerdpack from scratch with nr1 create --type nerdpack, then your Nerdpack has a unique identifier. Find this identifier in the root directory's nr1.json file: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"DemoApp\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack demo-app\" } nr1.json Copy This ID must be unique to your Nerdpack when you publish it to the catalog. The platform will reject your Nerdpack if it recognizes the ID. So, if you cloned an existing Nerdpack or are otherwise using open source code, generate a new UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --generate --force Tip Read the nr1 nerdpack:uuid documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --help Publish your Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish If you've successfully published your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This output describes the published Nerdpack. First, it states the Nerdpack's ID (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890). Then, its version (1.0.0). Finally, its version tag (STABLE). You already managed your Nerdpack's ID and version, but the version tag is new. To manage your Nerdpack's versions, you can tag them with an arbitrary tag. For example, if a version is still in development, you can tag it with a DEV tag. If the version moves to a QA phase, you can tag it with QA. If it's ready for production, you can tag it with STABLE. Tip Read our tag guide to learn more. Use the -t or --tag option to publish your Nerdpack with a tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag DEV As you saw in the nr1 nerdpack:publish output, if you don't pass a tag, nr1 applies the STABLE tag automatically. However, you can tell it to not apply any tags to a release with the -T or --skip-tag option: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --skip-tag You can also perform a dry run to make sure you publish your Nerdpack the way you want to: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --dry-run Step 2 of 4 Once you've successfully published your Nerdpack, go to New Relic: Because you're going to view a published Nerdpack, rather than a locally served one, you don't need to pass the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to Instant Observability: Whether you published a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Instant Observability. Step 4 of 4 Find your published Nerdpack using the Apps filter or search bar: Notice the Custom indicator on its UI tile. Use this to distinguish between published Nerdpacks and locally-served Nerdpacks. Tip Only Nerdpacks with tagged versions are shown in Instant Observability. So, if you published without a tag or removed a tag from your published Nerdpack, you won't see it in the catalog. Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you publish your Nerdpack, you may come across issues. Whether you can't publish your Nerdpack due to some issue with your code or you can't find your Nerdpack in Instant Observability, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your command When you attempt to publish your Nerdpack, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. For example: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack DemoApp (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890) › Error: There is already a Nerdpack with given id & version. › Code: 409 It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --verbose Reveal your published Nerdpack information If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, it may not be tagged. Remember, at least one version of your published Nerdpack must have a tag for it to show on the Apps page. See more information about your published Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:info: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 3014918 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 3 hours ago In this example, there is one published version, but it isn't tagged. You can tag a published version with: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --from-version=1.0.0 --tag=DEV Now, if you refresh your browser page, you should see your Nerdpack on Apps. Tip Read our nr1 nerdpack:tag documentation to learn more. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you publish your Nerdpack, only users who can access your account can see your published Nerdpack. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic but you know it's published, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same.",

Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions To subscribe to a Nerdpack, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can subscribe to them: Publish your Nerdpack Tag your Nerdpack if it's published and doesn't yet have a tag Subscribe to a Nerdpack Subscribe to a published Nerdpack, with either the web UI or the nr1 CLI, to use it in your account. Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Instant Observability: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack using the apps filter or search bar: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the Instant Observability catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel.

Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV.

If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info AbTest (Nerdpack): description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

AbTestNerdlet (Nerdlet): displayName: AbTestNerdlet supportedEntityTypes.mode: NONE All the information from catalog shows here. Step 3 of 3 View your app in Instant Observability: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Subscribe to your New Relic One application.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions To subscribe to a Nerdpack, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can subscribe to them: Publish your Nerdpack Tag your Nerdpack if it's published and doesn't yet have a tag Subscribe to a Nerdpack Subscribe to a published Nerdpack, with either the web UI or the nr1 CLI, to use it in your account. Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Instant Observability: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack using the apps filter or search bar: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the Instant Observability catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel. Tip nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:unset. Read the nr1 subscription:unset documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:unset --help Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you subscribe to a Nerdpack, you may run into issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add a new configuration option Step 1 of 8 In your visualization's nr1.json file, add an enum configuration object for selectedChart: index.js nr1.json 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 Radar: 'radar', 24 Treemap: 'treemap', 25 }; 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

Step 3 of 8 Serve your Nerdpack locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve If you're still serving your Nerdpack from the last lesson, you need to stop it with CTRL-X and serve it again to reflect changes to nr1.json. Step 4 of 8 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The nerdpacks=local query string directs the UI to load your visualization from the local server. Step 5 of 8 Open the Apps page: Step 6 of 8 Go to Custom Visualizations, which is favorited by default: Step 7 of 8 In Custom Visualizations, find and click your visualization: Step 8 of 8 Notice the new Select chart configuration option: Selecting a chart type doesn't effect your visualization. This is because you first need to introduce the selectedChart property to the visualization component. Then, you use selectedChart to determine the chart type to render. Replace your SegmentedControl with the configurable property Step 1 of 5 Open your visualization's index.js file. You'll be working here for the rest of the guide.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One Apps overlay. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl.

Step 4 of 8 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The nerdpacks=local query string directs the UI to load your visualization from the local server.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

      "body": "In your application, you can display data in charts, like those used elsewhere in New Relic's user interface. The New Relic One SDK provides React components for different chart types. Once you decide the kind of data you want to present, either from New Relic or some other source, you supply that data to your chart, using props. Query New Relic data In some cases, you want to fetch data from New Relic's database. For example, you may want to display a line chart which plots the number of transactions your application receives over time. With your chart component, set the accountId and query props to query your New Relic data using NRQL: <LineChart accountId={1234} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" />; Copy Alternatively, you can fetch data with a NrqlQuery and set the data prop: <NrqlQuery accountId={1234} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\"> {({ data }) => <LineChart data={data} />} </NrqlQuery>; Copy If you're looking to visualize New Relic data, such as your web application's response times or your server's throughput, querying data in your charts is the way to go. But what if you want to create charts that aren't focused on New Relic data? The data prop is flexible enough that you can supply any arbitrary data, as long as it matches the standardized format. Craft custom data Whether you use custom data sets or the results of a NrqlQuery, a chart's data prop must be an array of objects where each object has both of the following fields: metadata: Defines how the chart presents its data data: An array of data points that appear on the chart For example, create a chart consisting of a line between two points by supplying two x-y coordinates in its data field: const data = [ { metadata: { id: 'series-1', name: 'My series', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0, }, { x: 20, y: 10, }, ], }, ]; <LineChart data={data} />; Copy This LineChart plots a line between coordinates (0, 0) and (20, 10). Use x-y coordinates for all two-dimensional chart formats. For other formats, which you'll learn more about later, use other types of data points. Because data accepts an array, you can supply two series to the same chart: const data = [ { metadata: { id: 'series-1', name: 'My series', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0, }, { x: 20, y: 10, }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'series-2', name: 'My second series', viz: 'main', color: 'red', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 50, }, { x: 20, y: 100, }, ], }, ]; <LineChart data={data} />; Copy In this example, you create a single chart with two series. The first series contains the line from the last example. The second series contains a line between points (0, 50) and (20, 100). When using two series in a single chart, like this, you may want to define how the chart represents each series. Use metadata to define those elements. Metadata A series's metadata defines certain features of the series, itself, such as how it should be displayed in your chart. metadata consists of the following attributes: Attribute Description id The series's identifier. Two series having the same id are considered the same series, regardless of where they are located. In general, use a unique id for each series. However, if you use the same series for multiple charts, keeping the id consistent can help with some cross-chart functionality, like simultaneously highlighting multiple charts. name The series's name. name is used in legends, tooltips, and other areas to indicate which series you’re looking at. color The series's color. Most visualizations use this value to differentiate series. Some visualizations, like BillboardChart or JsonChart, ignore it. Use any valid CSS color representation, such as #RRGGBB, hsl(HHH, SS%, LL%), or rgba(RR, GG, BB, .AA). Avoid tweaking the alpha value, when possible, because charts use alpha to highlight or dim certain series. viz The series's visual style. While you most often use main, this field accepts several options: main: Show the series based on chart's type. For instance, a LineChart shows the series as a line, and an AreaChart shows the series as an area. line: Show the series as a line, regardless of the chart's type. This setting applies only to AreaChart and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. area: Show the series as an area, regardless of the chart's type. This setting applies only to LineChart and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. event: Show the series as an event, regardless of the chart's type. Charts represent an event as a vertical area behind the main visualization. Events are often used to show alerts. This setting applies only to AreaChart, LineChart, and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. target-line: Show the series as a vertical line. This setting applies only to AreaChart, LineChart, and ScatterChart. Other chart types will not show the series. units_data You can assign a unit type to each axis on a chart. The chart will present data according to the unit type you set with units_data. To set unit_data, pass a JSON object with maps the axis to one of the following unit types: UNKNOWN: The chart displays the series with no special units. COUNT: Each value in the chart represents a count. The chart formats values with their International System prefix. For example, \"k\" represents thousands, \"M\" represents millions, and \"G\" represents billions. PERCENTAGE: Each value in the chart represents a percentage. Typically, you provide values ranging from 0 to 1. The chart formats a value of 1 as \"100%\", a value of 2 as \"200%\", and a value of 0.01 as \"1%\". MS: Each value in the chart represents some number of milliseconds. The chart represents values higher than 1 as a human-readable time duration. For example, 60000 is represented as \"1 minute\". The chart represents values lower than 1 using SI prefixes. For example, 0.001 is represented as 1 μs. TIMESTAMP: Each value in the chart represents a timestamp, the number milliseconds since midnight UTC on January 1, 1970, the UNIX Epoch. The chart formats each value as a date. BITS: Each value in the chart represents some number of bits. The chart formats these values using \"b\". When upscaling, the chart will display decimal prefixes instead of binary ones. For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kb\". BITS_PER_SECOND: Each value in the chart represents some number of bits per second. The chart formats these values using \"b/s\". When upscaling, the chart will display decimal prefixes instead of binary ones. For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kb/s\". BYTES: Each value in the chart represents some number of bytes. The chart formats these values using \"B\". For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kB\". BYTES_PER_SECOND: Each value in the chart represents some number of bytes per second. The chart formats these values using \"B/s\". For example, the chart displays 1000 as \"1 kB/s\". So, to represent the y-axis for your series in bits, set the y-value in units_data: { \"units_data\": { \"y\": \"BITS\" } } Data While a data series can contain any arbitrary values, a chart only uses values which adhere to its type. So, create your data points according to the chart type: Series Type Example Description Unidimensional [{ \"y\": 10 }, { \"y\": 20 }] The chart plots data points using y values. Use this format with BarChart, BillboardChart, PieChart, StackedBarChart. Two-dimensional [ { \"x\": 10, \"y\": 20 }, { \"x\": 20, \"y\": 30 } ] The chart plots data points using x and y values. Use this format with AreaChart, LineChart, ScatterChart, SparklineChart, Funnel [{ \"label1\": 10, \"label2\": 20 }] The chart plots data according to labels. Use this format with FunnelChart. Table [{ \"jobType\": \"SIMPLE\", \"count\": 18 }] The chart plots data according to table columns. You must specify table columns in the metadata. Use this format with TableChart. Event [ { \"x0\": 0, \"x1\": 5 }, { \"x0\": 10, \"x1\": 15 } ] The chart plots the event's width based on x0 and x1 values. Histogram [ { \"x0\": 10, \"x1\": 20, \"y\": 100 }, { \"x0\": 30, \"x1\": 40, \"y\": 150 } ] The chart plots the series's width based on x0 and x1 and height based on y. Use this format with HistogramChart and HeatmapChart. Tip JsonChart is a special case because it processes any valid data. For example, you can set an arbitrary JSON object for the chart's data: const data = { data: [ { id: 1, name: 'Foo', price: 123, tags: ['Bar', 'Eek'], stock: { warehouse: 300, retail: 20, } } ], } <JsonChart data={data} /> Copy Special States In previous sections, you learned that a chart's data is an array of series. But you can use special values to present special chart states: null or undefined: Indicates the chart is “loading” its data. In this state, the chart shows a placeholder data set. []: Indicates there is no data to show. The chart states, \"No chart data available\". Configure your chart As you've seen, you use query or data to supply data to your chart, but you can configure other aspects of your chart, too, such as visual settings and click and hover event listeners. Read the documentation for the chart you're using for more specific information. Chart Groups Under some circumstances, you might want to synchronize events, such as dragging or scrubbing, across multiple charts. To do this, use a ChartGroup. All charts in a ChartGroup synchronize their events: <ChartGroup> <Stack> <StackItem> <LineChart accountId={1} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago\" /> </StackItem> <StackItem> <AreaChart accountId={1} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM Synthetics SINCE 1 day ago\" /> </StackItem> </Stack> </ChartGroup>; Copy Ideally, group charts that are conceptually related, and separate charts that are conceptually unrelated. Next Step Read the documentation specific to the chart you'd like to use to learn specifics about that chart's behavior and configuration.",

To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another. Step 4 of 4 In index.js, change your component's Radar.fillOpacity: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 } from 'recharts'; 10 import {Card, CardBody, HeadingText, NrqlQuery, Spinner, AutoSizer} from 'nr1'; 11 12 export default class MyAwesomeVisualizationVisualization extends React.Component { 13 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 14 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_timer. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] }, \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Access the New Relic platform from the comfort of your terminal. You can use the New Relic CLI to manage entity tags, define workloads, record deployment markers, and much more. In short, you can use the CLI to automate common tasks in your DevOps workflow. This guide walks you through the essentials of New Relic CLI, from install and configuration to basic usage. Before you begin For this guide you just need: Your New Relic user key. An instrumented application in your New Relic account. Step 1 of 10 Install the New Relic CLI Download the New Relic CLI for your operating system, as described below. You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux Using Snapcraft, run: bash Copy $ sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS Using Homebrew, run: bash Copy $ brew install newrelic-cli Windows Using Scoop, run: bash Copy $ scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git $ scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 10 Create your New Relic CLI profile. After you install the New Relic CLI, it's time to create your first profile. Profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command, which is useful when switching between accounts. Run the profiles add command: bash Copy $ # Create the tutorial account for the US region $ newrelic profiles add --profile tutorial --apiKey YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY -r YOUR_REGION $ # Set the profile as defaults $ newrelic profiles default --profile tutorial Important You must set the region of your New Relic account. Use -r to set either us or eu. Step 3 of 10 Get your application details. Now, add tags to the application you've instrumented with New Relic. Tags are key-value pairs that can help you organize and filter your entities. An entity (for example, an application) can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. Before searching for your application using the New Relic CLI, write down or copy your Account ID and the name of your application in New Relic - you need both to find applications in the New Relic platform. Step 4 of 10 Retrieve your application details as a JSON object. To search for your APM application, use the apm application search command: bash Copy $ newrelic apm application search --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID --name NAME_OF_YOUR_APP Tip If you get an error, check that your account ID and application name are correct. Step 5 of 10 Find the guid value. If the account ID is valid, and the application name exists in your account, apm application search yields data similar to this example: [ { \"accountId\": YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, \"applicationId\": YOUR_APP_ID, \"domain\": \"APM\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"A_LONG_GUID\", \"name\": \"NAME_OF_YOUR_APP\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/A_LONG_GUID\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" } ] Copy When you've successfully searched for your application, look for the guid value. It's a unique identifier for your application. You should copy it or write it down. Step 6 of 10 Add a simple tag to your application. Now that you have the GUID, you can point the New Relic CLI directly at your application. Adding a tag is the simplest way to try out the CLI capabilities (don't worry, tags can be deleted by using entity tags delete). Here, you add an environment tag to your application. Add the dev:testing tag⁠ (or any other key-value pair) to your application using the entities tags create command: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag devkit:testing Step 7 of 10 Add tag sets. What if you want to add multiple tags? Tag sets to the rescue! While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 To add multiple tags to your application at once, modify and run this snippet: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Important Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: this means it could take a while for the tags to get created. Step 8 of 10 Retrieve your application's tags. You've created and added some tags to your application, but to test that they're working, you need to retrieve them. Run the entity tags get command: bash Copy $ newrelic entity tags get --guid YOUR_APP_GUID All tags associated with your application are retrieved as a JSON array: [ { \"Key\": \"tag1\", \"Values\": [\"true\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag2\", \"Values\": [\"test\"] }, { \"Key\": \"tag3\", \"Values\": [\"testing\"] } // ... ] Copy Step 9 of 10 Bonus step: create a deployment marker. Deployments of applications often go wrong. Deployment markers are labels that, when attached to your application data, help you track deployments and troubleshoot what happened. To create a deployment marker, run the apm deployment create command using the same application ID from your earlier search: bash Copy $ newrelic apm deployment create --applicationId YOUR_APP_ID --revision $(git describe --tags --always) Step 10 of 10 Check the JSON response for the revision and timestamp of the deployment. You can build this workflow into a continuous integration or continuous deployment (CI/CD) system to indicate changes in your application's behavior after deployments. Here's an example: { \"id\": 37075986, \"links\": { \"application\": 204261368 }, \"revision\": \"v1.2.4\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-03-04T15:11:44-08:00\", \"user\": \"Developer Toolkit Test Account\" } Copy Next steps Have a look at all the available commands in the New Relic CLI. For example, you can create a New Relic workflow using workload create If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

This integration is built on our Fluent Bit output plugin. Forwarding your FireLens logs to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data. Basic process To enable log management capabilities: Make sure you have: A New Relic license key Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS) cluster Configure the FireLens log router container to run as a sidecar. (A sidecar is a way to move part of a service's core responsibility into a containerized module that is deployed alongside the core application.) Configure the application container. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Configure the FireLens log router container New Relic uses a Fluent Bit image to configure the FireLens log router container. This container handles all log routing from application plugins. To forward your logs from FireLens to New Relic: Add a sidecar container to your pre-existing ECS task definition that will act as the Firelens log router. For help configuring ECS log routing, see the Amazon ECS documentation for custom log routing. Substitute the recommended images with the New Relic Fluent Bit output plugin image for your AWS region. Set the memoryReservation attribute for this container.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One Apps overlay. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

Add a new configuration option Step 1 of 8 In your visualization's nr1.json file, add an enum configuration object for selectedChart: index.js nr1.json 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 Radar: 'radar', 24 Treemap: 'treemap', 25 }; 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

Step 3 of 8 Serve your Nerdpack locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve If you're still serving your Nerdpack from the last lesson, you need to stop it with CTRL-X and serve it again to reflect changes to nr1.json. Step 4 of 8 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The nerdpacks=local query string directs the UI to load your visualization from the local server. Step 5 of 8 Open the Apps page: Step 6 of 8 Go to Custom Visualizations, which is favorited by default: Step 7 of 8 In Custom Visualizations, find and click your visualization: Step 8 of 8 Notice the new Select chart configuration option: Selecting a chart type doesn't effect your visualization. This is because you first need to introduce the selectedChart property to the visualization component. Then, you use selectedChart to determine the chart type to render. Replace your SegmentedControl with the configurable property Step 1 of 5 Open your visualization's index.js file. You'll be working here for the rest of the guide. Step 2 of 5 In render(), include selectedChart as a constant you get from destructuring props, and remove your component's state: index.js nr1.json 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 Radar: 'radar', 24 Treemap: 'treemap', 25 }; 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called my-awesome-visualization, in a Nerdpack, called my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name my-awesome-visualization ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you.

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One Apps overlay. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another. Step 4 of 4 In index.js, change your component's Radar.fillOpacity: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 } from 'recharts'; 10 import {Card, CardBody, HeadingText, NrqlQuery, Spinner, AutoSizer} from 'nr1'; 11 12 export default class MyAwesomeVisualizationVisualization extends React.Component { 13 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 14 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Before you begin Explore our custom visualization guides and build your first visualization. After you're done, you'll have a better foundation for building more complex visualizations, such as the one you'll build in this course. Finally, if you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create your visualization Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called radar-or-treemap, in a Nerdpack, called alternate-viz: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name radar-or-treemap ✔ You’re trying to create a visualization outside of a Nerdpack. We’ll create a Nerdpack for you—what do you want to name it? … alternate-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack alternate-viz is available at \"./alternate-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization radar-or-treemap is available at \"./alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/radar-or-treemap directory under alternate-viz: bash Copy $ cd alternate-viz $ ls visualizations/radar-or-treemap index.js nr1.json styles.scss Set up your component state Add component state to the default visualization template that nr1 created for you. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap/index.js. You'll work in here for the rest of this lesson.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type. Use SegmentedControl and SegmentedControlItem to switch between the two chart types. Tip To learn more about the components available in the New Relic One SDK, go to our Intro to New Relic One SDK.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Fetch data from a third-party service, before starting this one. In this course, you're building a New Relic One application. This application shows telemetry data from a demo service that is running an A/B test so that it can reveal that data in charts, like a dashboard. Your New Relic application is different than a dashboard, however, because it does more than show New Relic data. It pulls external data, provides UI components and functionality, and even has its own small data stores. The purpose of this New Relic application is to present context so you can better understand the A/B test results and how those results tie in to your business objectives. So far, you've built all your charts, organized them for improved usability, provided them with real data, and more. There are some final improvements you can make, using Platform API components. In this lesson, you learn how to use values in the New Relic platform state. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-platform-state-context/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, add a PlatformStateContext.Consumer to your NewsletterSignups component's render() method: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Notice that NrqlQuery uses a constant called ACCOUNT_ID. Instead of hardcoding an account identifier in your Nerdlet, you can use accountId from the platform URL state. Step 3 of 10 PlatformStateContext.Consumer provides access to the platform's URL state. This context contains an important value you'll use in your app, called timeRange. Notice that your NrqlQuery uses a SINCE clause that identifies the historical timeframe your query should fetch data from. Right now, that SINCE clause is set to 30 MINUTES AGO. With timeRange, you can use the platform's time picker to make this timeframe adjustable. Step 4 of 10 Utilize the platform state's timeRange: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, NewsletterSignups uses platformState.timeRange instead of a hardcoded SINCE clause. While NrqlQuery components accept a convenient timeRange prop, not every component does. You can still use timeRange in other contexts by accessing duration, begin_time, or end_time: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { console.log(platformState.timeRange.duration); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>; Copy Step 5 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test. Step 6 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 7 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 10 View your application: Your NrqlQuery now uses the platform state's timeRange, but your chart probably still shows the last 30 minutes. Why? Where does the timeRange in platform state come from? The time picker sits on the right side of your application's navigation bar: Change this value and see your chart update: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 9 of 10 Update VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Of all the charts in your New Relic One application, these three charts are the ones that should update with the time picker. The others, Total subscriptions per version, Total cancellations per version, Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions, Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, show total values over time. So, hardcoding their SINCE clauses to 7 DAYS AGO makes sense, as this is a reasonable time period for the purposes of this course. Step 10 of 10 While still serving your Nerdpack locally, view your NR1 app to see your charts updating with the time range you choose: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now that you're basing your queries off the platform state, some of your charts are dynamic in their time ranges. This is a great improvement because it allows you to adjust your charts to show data from any particular point in time, which is useful for tying data to business outcomes. The Platform API components offer a lot more functionality, too, including the ability to navigate the user to another place in New Relic. You'll learn how to do this in the next lesson.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorage from your nerdlet, before starting this one. Throughout this course, you're building a New Relic One application that gathers telemetry data from a demo web service that's running an A/B test on a newsletter signup form. The purpose of your New Relic One application is to help you understand how design changes impact the number of high quality newsletter subscriptions your service gets. The business objective, to increase your service's high quality newsletter subscriptions, relies primarily on three key pieces of information: Number of page views per version Number of subscriptions per version Number of cancellations Cancellations are important because if one design version of your newsletter signup form results in a high number of subscriptions but also a high number of cancellations, then those subscriptions are not as valuable. In previous lessons, you gathered data for page views and subscriptions from New Relic's database (NRDB), but you still need cancellation data. Your demo application does not report cancellation data to New Relic, so you need to fetch that data from an external source. We've provided a service at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations to return fake cancellation data for the purposes of this course. If you visit this URL in your browser, you'll see a brief message: \"Unauthorized\". This is because we created this service with a requirement that whoever requests its data must pass an Authorization header with the bearer token ABC123. So before you can request cancellation data from api.nerdsletter.net, you need to implement a few new behaviors in your application: Provide a mechanism for inputting an authorization token Persist the authorization token in a secure data store To input your authorization token, you'll use a Modal with a TextField. The secure data store you'll use is called NerdStorageVault. It's different from NerdStorage, which you used in the last lesson, because it only supports user storage and encrypts its data. Store your API token Step 1 of 3 Change to the add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 3 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, initialize state in AbTestNerdletNerdlet with a null token default: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Your Nerdlet uses this token state to manage the authorization token you'll later pass to the third-party service. However, a component's state is not a long-term solution for data management. For that, you need NerdStorageVault. Step 3 of 3 Implement a method, called storeToken(), which mutates NerdStorageVault data, and bind that method to the AbTestNerdletNerdlet instance: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy When you call storeToken() with a new token value, your Nerdlet uses NerdGraph APIs to mutate NerdStorageVault data for the api_token key. If the request to NerdGraph is successful, storeToken() updates state.token so that the new token is locally accessible. Unlike NerdStorage, which has query and mutation components for your convenience, NerdStorageVault has no components in the SDK. Instead, you have to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to interact with it Important It's important to remember that NerdStorageVault is limited to the user scope. Any other users of your New Relic One application will have their own NerdStorageVault data. This means that even other users on your account will need to enter their token separately. Query your API token Step 1 of 2 First, create methods and state to show and hide your API token prompt: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy state.hideTokenPrompt determines whether or not the prompt is visible. Now, you need a mechanism for revealing the prompt, which is hidden by default. Step 2 of 2 Query NerdStorageVault for your api_token: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, in componentDidMount(), you've queried NerdGraph for your api_token data. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that's called when your component is mounted in the component tree. This means that early in it's setup process, your application will request your api_token. If the NerdGraph query responds successfully with your token from NerdStorageVault, it sets the token in state. Otherwise, it shows the prompt so that you can enter a token. This is great for storing an initial token, but what if you enter the wrong token or the API changes? You need a way reveal the prompt on-demand. Next, you'll create the actual token prompt and a button to manually invoke the prompt. Create your token prompt Step 1 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named token-prompt.js: bash Copy $ touch token-prompt.js Step 2 of 9 In this new file, create a button that allows you to enter a new token on demand: import React from 'react'; import { Button } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenButton receives showPrompt() in its props and calls that method when its Button is clicked. Step 3 of 9 Create a token prompt using a Modal with a TextField: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenPrompt renders a Modal with a TextField, a Button, and an explanatory prompt. You use the Modal to enter your API token. It also provides basic error handling if you try to submit the form with no token value. It's important to distinguish the token in AbTestNerdletNerdlet.state and the token in ApiTokenPrompt.state. The token in your Nerdlet's state is the current token that your Nerdlet knows about. It's this token that matches what's in NerdStorageVault. The token in ApiTokenPrompt.state is a fluid value that changes as you update the text in the TextField. When you press Submit in the modal, ApiTokenPrompt submits its token to your Nerdlet's storeToken() method. Then, storeToken() mutates NerdStorageVault with the new token. You also implemented a few methods to improve the user experience: keyPress() submits the token when the RETURN key is pressed showTokenError() and hideTokenError() remind the user that they must enter a token before submitting the form Step 4 of 9 Export your components, so you can use them in your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ?

Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you visit your application for the first time, the prompt is automatically revealed. Enter \"ABC123\" in the TextField, as that's the token that the third-party service expects. Once you submit your token and your Nerdlet hides the prompt, click Update API token at the bottom of your New Relic One application to reveal it again: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Pass your API token to TotalCancellations Step 1 of 3 In index.js, pass the API token to TotalCancellations so you're prepared to make a request to the third-party service: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views';

this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <TotalCancellations token={this.state.token} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 2 of 3 In total-cancellations.js, log the token to your browser console: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { lastToken: null } } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) this.setState({lastToken: this.props.token}) } } render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy Here, you've implemented another React lifecycle method, called componentDidUpdate(). Now, every time your Nerdlet's state.token changes, TotalCancellations gets a new token prop, which triggers componentDidUpdate(). In componentDidUpdate(), you check that the incoming token is not the same as the last token it knew about, which is stored in local state. If the incoming token is different, you log a message with the new token and update state.lastToken. This logic prepares your code for a future change to use your API token in a request to a third-party service. Step 3 of 3 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see the log from TotalCancellations in your browser's console: If you change your token, you'll see another log from TotalCancellations with your updated token. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now you know how to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to manage data in NerdStorageVault! Remember, use NerdStorage for your New Relic One application's non-sensitive data and NerdStorageVault for the sensitive stuff like tokens, passwords, and other secrets. As a bonus, you created a way to manage your token in NerdStorageVault from the user interface. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component for later use. Whether it's been with NrqlQuery, AccountStorageQuery, AccountStorageMutation, NerdGraphQuery, or NerdGraphMutation, you've learned several ways to interact with New Relic data in your New Relic One application. But New Relic One applications aren't just another way to show New Relic data. The purpose of New Relic One applications is to show you how your software is helping you meet your business objectives. Sometimes, New Relic data is all you need to make that happen, but other times you need to look beyond New Relic for data to fill in the gaps.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add user interface components to your application, before starting this one. In previous hands-on lessons, you created all the charts from your design guide. Unfortunately, they aren’t laid out like they are in the design. The New Relic One SDK provides multiple solutions for organizing your components. The one you’ll learn about in this lesson is the Grid component. To arrange your charts, place them in a Grid. A Grid is a container you use to organize your content into 12-column rows. A GridItem is the building block for a Grid. You specify the columnSpan of a GridItem between 1 and 12 to determine how much of the row that the GridItem should cover. So, if you want a chart to stretch across the width of the view, you would place the chart in a GridItem with a columnSpan of 12. If you want twelve charts to fit in a single row, use a columnSpan of 1. Using the design guide as a base, you can plan how to organize your Grid: Once you’ve planned out how you’re going to arrange your columns, you can write some code to realize your plans. Step 1 of 6 Change to the add-a-grid/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import Grid and GridItem. Then, update your Nerdlet's render() method by placing each chart in a GrildItem. Finally, place all your items in a Grid: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy The columnSpan for each chart matches the layout plan. Every chart that takes up half the 12-column row has a columnSpan of 6, and every chart that takes up the whole row has a columnSpan of 12. Notice that each of the charts in the ChartGroup, but not the ChartGroup itself, is in a GridItem. A ChartGroup connects charts' behaviors, not their locations. Each chart fills its columnSpan because they use the fullWidth prop. fullWidth makes the chart fill its available horizontal space and GridItem.columnSpan restricts that space to some fraction of the row. Remove a fullWidth prop, and see how the chart reacts. Technical detail Notice the wrapper class applied to the Grid. We quietly provided some CSS styles to help make this app look great! This isn't a CSS course, so we won't cover everything we added, we'll just include the styles we intend for you to use in the code snippets. Just know that every UI component in the New Relic One SDK provides a className prop where you can provide a CSS class name. You can view the styles in nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see your charts styled and arranged in a grid. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. In just six steps, you significantly improved the readability and usability of your A/B test application, but you can take further steps to improve the usability of your charts. In the next lesson, you’ll add headings to your charts to remind yourself of what data each chart presents.

With your charts organized and descriptive headings above each one, your New Relic One application is becoming more usable. In this lesson, you'll continue that trend by creating descriptions for each design version in your A/B test. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-version-descriptions/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-version-descriptions/ab-test Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named description.js: bash Copy $ touch description.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a new React component, called VersionDescription, which uses a HeadingText and a BlockText to render a version description that you pass, using the description prop: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, HeadingText } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionDescription extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return ( <div> <HeadingText className=\"versionHeader\"> Version {this.props.version} </HeadingText> <BlockText className=\"versionText\"> {this.props.description} </BlockText> </div> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/description.js Copy You'll use this one class to create a version description for each design version in your A/B test.

You passed the description and version props, which correspond to a design version. You also added a horizontal rule to visually separate the descriptions from the charts in your app. For this, you added a GridItem with a columnSpan of 12, to stretch the rule the full width of the grid. Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-version-descriptions/ab-test.

Now, you've added descriptions for your competing designs and your charts. In the next lesson, you’ll create a new section of your application from user interface components.

      "body": "Taking some time to consider your headings and document titles will be time well spent. Titles and headings are not only important for search results, but they can make your docs easier to skim. For all headings and document titles, use sentence case. Use parallel construction Use parallel construction when naming headers. For example, use all nouns (\"Organization,\" \"Tone\"), all verbs (\"Create,\" \"Delete\"), etc. Keep it short, avoid -ing words For all headers, keep the title as short as possible. In particular, avoid headers that are more than a line long. As with all our writing, you should feel free to address the reader directly: Install the agent, for example, rather than Agent installation. You should also avoid -ing words, which add to character count without contributing clarity. Do not use h1 headings After you publish your doc, the docs site will automatically use what you added to the Title field as the doc's level one heading (h1). To ensure that your doc is properly indexed for search, do not manually create additional h1 headings. If your doc's title is long and you would like a shorter title to appear in the sidebar menu, create a GitHub issue and we'll help you with that change. Use level two headings to identify chunks of information Organize chunks of information into sections with level two headings (##). For example: ## Create a new user [#create-new-user] Copy Important If you don't specify an ID manually, the site will use your header text as that header's ID (also known as anchor link). Create a manual ID to preserve links to that header if you change the header text. If you have too many level sections, consider splitting the document into multiple pages. Avoid using level three headings Avoid using ### headings unless it makes sense for the content or if the content is lengthy. Collapsers, tables, and other structural elements are often a better choice. Be particularly careful about level three headings that make a level two section longer than a single screen height. Here are two examples of good scenarios for using level three headings: Example #1: Events-to-metrics API doc Example #2: Infrastructure integration doc",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add version descriptions, before starting this one. In this course, you’re building an A/B test application in New Relic. The application presents a lot of data, through its charts, about the effectiveness of each design version you’re testing on your demo website. Ultimately, you’ll be able to use that data to decide which design is most effective and show that design to every user who visits your site. In this lesson, you’ll build a form into your application that lets you choose which design you want to show to every user of your site. Before writing any code, look at your design guide to review the section you’re going to build: This new section has three main components: A heading with instructional copy: \"Pick a version to end the test\" A component that you use to crown the winning version of the A/B test A button to confirm the winner that you selected Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-end-test-section/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named end-test.js: bash Copy $ touch end-test.js Step 3 of 10 In this new file, create a VersionSelector component to encapsulate a Select and its SelectItem child components: import React from 'react'; import { Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy VersionSelector renders a Select component with two choices. In each SelectItem, you specify a value prop. In this case, you use 'A' to represent version A and 'B' to represent version B. Step 4 of 10 Create another component for a Button you'll use to make your test as ended: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy This looks trivial, but it will encapsulate button logic as you iterate on your app code. Step 5 of 10 Create a final component for the entire section you'll use to mark the end of your test: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you create a Grid with three items. First, you create a GridItem that contains a HeadingText and spans all 12 columns. In the next row, you have two items: The VersionSelector component you created in the previous step A Button which reads \"End test\" These items each span one column, but instead of using columnSpan, they use a combination of columnStart and columnEnd to specify which columns they cover. Step 6 of 10 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, add EndTestSection to your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. However, you need to make a few improvements to this code. When you select a version, the selected value in the component doesn't change.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Persist the selected version, before starting this one. In this tutorial, you're building an A/B test application. The application surfaces data about an ongoing A/B test on your website, which you then use to decide which page design version is most effective at engaging users. As part of that overarching goal, you're building a section which allows you to end the test by deciding a winner of the experiment: Unfortunately, there are a few issues with the code and design for this section. By the end of this course, pressing End test will tell your website's backend server that every customer should see the version selected here. This is destructive behavior because it makes an irreversible change to your website. To account for the desctructiveness of pressing End test, you need to modify some features of your application: Make the button look important to catch your eye Prompt yourself with a confirmation message before ending the test to ensure you don't end it prematurely Show and hide your confirmation modal Step 1 of 12 Change to the present-confirmation-modal/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test This directory contains the code your application should have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 12 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, update the Button to use the DESTRUCTIVE styling: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Tip Read more about Button and its props on the New Relic developer site. Step 3 of 12 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test. Step 4 of 12 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 12 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 12 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: Now you've styled your button to convey its destructive consequences, but that's not enough to prevent you from accidentally clicking it. Next, you create a shield for your website's backend. This extra layer of protection requires you to confirm that you intend to end the test before actually doing so. Step 7 of 12 Add a Modal to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Your new modal contains a heading, a confirmation message, the winning design version, and two buttons. You'll explore some of these components later in this course. With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your new Modal: Tip Remember, while your server is running, it will update automatically when you save your code. The modal looks great, but it has three issues: It was present before you clicked End test You can't dismiss it It always says you selected \"Version A\", even if you didn't In the following steps, you'll correct all three of these issues. Step 8 of 12 In EndTestButton, initialize state with a value for modalHidden: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy modalHidden determines whether or not to hide the modal. The default value of modalHidden is true because you only want to show the modal when you select End test. Step 9 of 12 Supply modalHidden to the Modal: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy First, you've created a constructor to accept component props. This provides your component access to the modalHidden prop that you passed in EndTestSection. Then you provide the value of modalHidden to the Modal component's hidden prop. Tip Read more about Modal and its props on the New Relic developer site. Step 10 of 12 Add and bind two new methods to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Use closeModal and showModal to close and show your modal, respectively, depending on how a user interacts with the modal. Step 11 of 12 Show the modal when you click End test: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you've supplied showModal() as the callback for the Button component's onClick event. Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. The modal is hidden by default. Click End test to see the modal. Step 12 of 12 Close the modal from the Modal component's onClose callback and from the Yes, end test and No, continue test buttons: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Click End test. The modal opens and displays your confirmation message. Close the modal by clicking X at the top right, either of its buttons, or even in the dark space to its left. Notice that the modal says you chose \"Version A\", even if you choose \"Version B\". This is because \"Version A\" is hardcoded in the Modal text. Next, you'll make that dynamic. Use the version you selected in your modal Step 1 of 2 In EndTestSection, pass selectedVersion to the EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Now, you can access the selected version from the EndTestButton component's props. Step 2 of 2 Use selectedVersion in your confirmation message: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Select \"Version B\" from the menu. Click End test to see \"Version B\" in the confirmation modal: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Congratulations! You've done a lot of work and it shows in the usefulness of your application. You've created charts that show mocked data. You've organized your charts into a readable structure. You've added an interface for your users to interact with the test. Now, you need some real data. In the next lesson, you'll replace the mocked data in your charts with real data from your backend service.

      "body": "The Ruby agent automatically instruments Rack middlewares. If you are unfamiliar with the basics of Rack middlewares, review the resources linked by the Rails on Rack guide. Additionally, the Ruby agent provides some features via Rack middlewares: Distributed traces Auto-instrumentation for browser monitoring New Relic automatically installs these middlewares for Rails and Sinatra. Rack instrumentation The two most common ways to configure Rack middlewares are the Rack::Builder API (most often from config.ru) and Rails' middleware stack configuration: Rack::Builder Middlewares in your config.ru file are configured using Rack::Builder. For the Ruby agent to instrument middlewares from Rack::Builder, your app must run version 1.1.0 or higher of the rack gem. This is the most common use of middlewares with Sinatra or pure-rack applications. Rails middlewares Rails uses its own class (ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack) instead of Rack::Builder to configure middlewares. Even if you haven't explicitly added middlewares to your Rails application, many components of Rails itself are implemented as middleware, so middleware data will appear by default. The Ruby agent automatically instruments middlewares added via ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack on Rails 3.0 or higher. For more information about configuring middlewares with Rails, see the Ruby on Rails guide. Viewing middleware data You can view middleware data in APM. In the APM Summary page The main chart on your app's APM Summary page includes a purple bar that shows average time per request spent in all Rack middlewares for your application. APM > (selected application) > Summary: Middleware time appears in purple on your app's main Overview chart. In the APM Transactions page You can also see time for individual middlewares for a specific transaction name from your app's APM Transactions page. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction) > Trace details: Here is an example of middleware time for a selected transaction for your app. In APM transaction trace summary Transaction traces also capture detailed middleware call information. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction trace): Here is an example of middleware details in a transaction trace. Disabling Rack instrumentation If you do not want to instrument Rack middlewares, you may disable Rack middleware instrumentation with the disable_middleware_instrumentation setting. You can also ignore specific transactions. Installing Ruby agent middlewares manually The Ruby agent's implementation of New Relic's cross application tracing feature uses Rack middleware instrumentation to read and write HTTP headers that are necessary to pass information between monitored applications. If you are using Sinatra, have disabled middleware instrumentation as described above, and want to use cross application tracing, you must manually add the NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks middleware to your middleware stack. Important As of version 8.0.0, cross application tracing is deprecated in favor of distributed tracing. When enabled, distributed tracing is automatically configured for all rack-based apps without the need for an additional middleware. If you would like to continue using cross application tracing, you will need to update your configuration. Manual Rack instrumentation Earlier versions of the Ruby agent supported manually instrumenting Rack middlewares via the NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::Rack module. This instrumentation is deprecated in Ruby agent versions 3.9.0 or higher, because it is unnecessary with automatic middleware instrumentation. New Relic recommends that you remove references to this module from your code after upgrading to 3.9.0 or higher.",

      "body": "Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. Auto-telemetry with Pixie therefore benefits from Pixie's approach to keeping data secure. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. Community Cloud for Pixie makes queries directly to your Kubernetes cluster to access the data. In order for the query results to be shown in the Community Cloud for Pixie UI, CLI, and API, the data is sent to the client from your cluster using a reverse proxy. Community Cloud for Pixie’s reverse proxy is designed to ensure: Data is ephemeral. It only passes through the Community Cloud for Pixie's cloud proxy in transit. This ensures data locality. Data is encrypted while in transit. Only you are able to read your data. New Relic One fetches and stores data that related to an application's performance. With Auto-telemetry with Pixie, a predefined subset of data persists outside of your cluster. This data is stored in Telemetry Data Platform, in the your selected region. This data persists in order to give you long-term storage, alerting, correlation with additional data, and the ability to use advanced New Relic platform capabilities, such as anomaly detection. The persisted performance metrics include, but are not limited to: Golden metrics (throughput, latency, error rate) for HTTP-based services HTTP transaction data Database transaction data (for MySQL & PostgreSQL) Distributed tracing JVM metrics The data you view on the Live debugging tab comes through Community Cloud for Pixie, and is therefore potentially sensitive. It is not stored by New Relic and is ephemeral and queryable for less than 24 hours. Control who has access to Pixie data If you want to manage which members of your organization can view Pixie data in New Relic One, as well as install and delete Pixie links, you can create a custom role. Note that this option is available only to Enterprise and Pro level customers. For more information, see New Relic's user model. Manage auto-update and two-way communication Pixie maintains an active two-way communication channel from your host system to Community Cloud with Pixie at withpixie.ai. Pixie uses this communication channel to query data, push updates, and retrieve metadata and health checks about Pixie and your Kubernetes cluster. By default, Pixie queries withpixie.ai to check if new updates have been pushed and then automatically installs them if they’re present. To disable auto updates, you must set a flag prior to the install process using either Helm or in the newrelic-manifest.yaml file. To disable automatic updates, choose one: Helm option Add --set pixie-chart.disableAutoUpdate=true to your Helm command. newrelic-manifest.yaml option in your newrelic-manifest.yaml file under the pl-cluster-config section, add PL_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE: \"true\" to the data directive.

      "body": "The REST API endpoints allow you to create conditions for your policies. This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes five types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services NRQL Synthetic monitoring Plugins All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. aggregation_delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics). CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer value. The timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point is received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using the EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_window Streaming alerts gather data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable. The default is 1 minute. The maximum is 15 minutes. Data points are collected together based on their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Aggregation window field. close_violations_on_expiration When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the expiration_duration time. The default is false. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects that will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma-separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions evaluation_offset Deprecated in favor of aggregation_delay. The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is 3 minutes. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Offset evaluation by field. expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions expiration_duration How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection. external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions fill_option For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. none: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation. static: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. last_value: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Fill data gaps with field. fill_value This is the value used by the fill_option custom value. The default is 0. ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts plugin conditions For Plugin conditions this is the metric, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification. Alerts conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_app_metric apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_kt_metric apdex error_percentage error_count response_time throughput browser_metric end_user_apdex total_page_load page_rendering web_application network dom_processing request_queuing ajax_response_time page_views_with_js_errors page_view_throughput ajax_throughput user_defined browser_metric_baseline page_view_throughput average_response_time ajax_response_time ajax_application_time mobile_metric database images json, network view_loading network_error_percentage status_error_percentage user_defined Alerts external service conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_external_service apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_app_metric_baseline external_service_transaction_time error_count database_transaction_time throughput_web response_time_web non_web_transaction_time web_transaction_database_time non_web_transaction_database_time mobile_external_service response_time_average response_time_minimum response_time_maximum throughput network_failure_percentage http_status_error_percentage metric_description This is a title for the metric which is displayed in notifications. Make this descriptive and unique so the reader will understand the nature of plugin metric being used to trigger an alert. Used for: Plugin conditions monitor_id This is the GUID of the Synthetic monitoring to alert on. Used for: Synthetic monitoring conditions name This condition title will allow to you identify it in the UI. Follow the guidelines for making this descriptive but short. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions nrql[query] This is the NRQL query that alerts monitors as part of a NRQL condition. Used for: NRQL conditions nrql[since_value] This is the timeframe (in minutes) in which to evaluate the specified NRQL query. since_value must be between 1 and 20. Used for: NRQL conditions open_violation_on_expiration When true, this opens a loss of signal violation when no signal within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. plugin[guid] This is the GUID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions plugin[id] This is the ID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions runbook_url The runbook URL to display in notifications. This field is optional. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 2 minutes. Used with event flow and cadence aggregation methods. signal[aggregation_window] One of three data aggregation methods: event flow, event timer, and cadence. The default is Event flow. signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 1 minute. Used with Event timer aggregation method. signal[aggregation_window] The duration in which data is collected together before being evaluated. Default is 1 minute. terms[duration] This is the time (in minutes) for the condition to persist before triggering an event. It corresponds to the duration set when adding a threshold in the UI. Used for: Conditions terms[operator] This determines what comparison will be used between the value_function and the terms [ threshold] value to trigger an event. It corresponds to the operation selected when adding a threshold in the UI. It must be one of the following strings: above below equal Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[priority] This corresponds to the severity level selected when setting the threshold values for the condition in the UI. This must be one of the following strings: critical warning Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[threshold] This is the threshold that the value_function must be compared to using the terms [ operator] for an event to be triggered. It corresponds to the numeric value specified in the UI when adding the threshold values. This is a numeric value and must be 0 (zero) or greater. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[time_function] This corresponds to the settings made in the UI when adding the threshold values. The choices are: all (corresponding to for at least in the UI) any (corresponding to at least once in in the UI) Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions type This defines the type of metric that will be used for the alert. Allowable content for the metric field depends on the type value chosen. There are two product categories : Alerts conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of alerts condition. type Use apm_app_metric APM application metric will trigger an alert. apm_app_metric_baseline APM application metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). apm_kt_metric APM key transaction metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric Browser metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric_baseline Browser metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). mobile_metric Mobile metric will trigger an alert. Used for: Conditions Alerts external service conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of external service condition. type Use apm_external_service APM external metric will trigger an alert. mobile_external_service Mobile external metric will trigger an alert. Used for: External service conditions user_defined[metric] (optional) This is the name of a user defined custom metric to be used to determine if an event should be triggered. The user_defined [ value_function] associated with the metric is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions user_defined[value_function] (optional) This is the numeric value obtained from the custom metric specified by user_defined [ metric]. It is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. One of these value functions must be specified: average min max total sample_size Used for: Conditions value_function This is the value function used from the plugin metric. This may be one of the strings: min max average sample_size total percent Used for: Plugin conditions When used for a NRQL condition, the options are: single_value (condition is evaluated based on each query's returned value) sum (condition is evaluated based on the sum of each query's returned values over the specified duration) violation_time_limit_seconds Use to automatically close instance-based violations after the number of seconds specified. Must be one of these values: 3600 7200 14400 28800 43200 86400 Used for: Location conditions NRQL conditions violation_close_timer Use to automatically close instance-based violations, including JVM health metric violations, after the number of hours specified.

More specifically, you must pass a bearer token of ABC123 to gain authorized access to its data. If you make a request to the service with the header Authorization: Bearer ABC123, you'll get a successful response with the mocked cancellation data: bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations -H 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' {\"a\": 15, \"b\": 78} In the last lesson, you used NerdGraph to store this API token in your New Relic One application's NerdStorageVault data store. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component and logged its use to your browser's console. In this lesson, you follow up that log statement with a real request to the Nerdsletter API using your authorization token. Then, you supply the data from that external resource to your Total cancellations per version chart. Step 1 of 6 Change to the third-party-services/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/third-party-services/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 6 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js, make a request to api.nerdsletter.net with your API token. Save the results to state, and use that state in render(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { cancellations: [], lastToken: null } } generateChartData(data) { const cancellationsA = data ? data.a : 0; const cancellationsB = data ? data.b : 0; return [ { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsA }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsB }, ], }, ] } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`Requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) fetch( \"https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations\", {headers: {\"Authorization\": `Bearer ${this.props.token}`}} ).then( (response) => { if (response.status == 200) { return response.json() } else if (response.status == 401) { console.error(\"Incorrect auth header\") } else { console.error(response.text()) } } ).then( (data) => { if (data) { this.setState({ cancellations: this.generateChartData(data), lastToken: this.props.token }) } } ) } } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={this.state.cancellations} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy In this code, you initialize TotalCancellations.state.cancellations with zero for the y-value in each series instead of the previously hardcoded values. This helps to more realistically represent what the chart should show if your New Relic One app hasn't successfully requested data from the Nerdsletter API. Next, you use Javascript's fetch() function to make an HTTP request to the Nerdsletter API. You then pass your token in the request's Authorization header. If the request is successful, you update the cancellation data in TotalCancellations.state so that that data is reflected in the component's render method. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/third-party-service/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. If your token in NerdStorageVault is not \"ABC123\", then your console will show an error that reads, \"Incorrect auth header\": If you set the token to \"ABC123\", then Total cancellations per version updates to show the values from the third-party service: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great job! You've come a long way from running nr1 nerdpack:create for the first time. Take a look back at your design guide to see that your application now has everything from an interface and data perspective that you planned from the beginning: You've created eight charts with varying styles and supplied them with dynamic data from multiple sources. You've learned about the New Relic One SDK and used many of its components. You've even gathered data from a third-party service and mixed it seemlessly with your New Relic data to provide a complete look at how the competing versions in your A/B test perform against each other. From here, there is only one more set of APIs in the New Relic One SDK that you've yet to get your hands on: Platform APIs. These will come in handy in improving the usability of your New Relic One application.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize NRQL data, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { this[index] = { endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, } }, data ) historicalData.data = data return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data, format it according to the TableChart specifications, and set it on historicalData.data. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorageVault to store data in an encrypted storage solution. Using NerdStorageVault in your apps NerdStorageVault is used to store and retrieve sensitive secrets data such as: personal access tokens license keys API keys other third party secrets Tip NerdStorageVault is encrypted with AES-256 encryption Usage considerations This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorageVault can currently only be used within the context of a Nerdpack. You cannot make a direct query or mutation to NerdStorageVault. You can explore the fields and response types via the NerdGraph API explorer. The only supported scope is ACTOR, or data that relates to a particular user. Component library Currently NerdStorageVault is available in the alpha release of Nr1 Community component library and is not available in the Nr1 core components library. Open source components can be use to augment Nr1 core components for additional functionality. NerdGraph queries Below are examples of the queries used by the components to interact with NerdStorageVault. Tip NerdStorageVault can currently only be used within the context of a Nerdpack. Write mutation { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: \"test\", value: \"secret_test\" } ) { status errors { message type } } } Copy Delete mutation { nerdStorageVaultDeleteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } key: \"test_key\" ) { status errors { message type } } } Copy Fetch a single secret query { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: \"test_key\") { key value } } } } Copy Fetch a list of secrets query { actor { nerdStorageVault { secrets { key value } } } } Copy Limits A maximum of 10 secrets can be stored per ACTOR. A secret value is limited to 5000 characters. A key value is limited to 64 characters. Permissions for working with NerdStorageVault In order to persist changes to NerdStorageVault, such as writing, deleting, and fetching data, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add a grid, before starting this one. Organizing charts is one way to clarify the information you're trying to convey to your users. Headings are another. Since you have several charts on the same page, use headings to describe the information they show. To remember what data each chart presents, consult your design guide: The design guide details what data each chart shows. Use those details to craft useful headings for your charts. Step 1 of 6 Change to the add-chart-headings/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-chart-headings/ab-test Step 2 of 6 In newsletter-signups.js, page-views.js, past-tests.js, total-cancellations.js, total-subscriptions.js, and totals.js, import HeadingText and add a descriptive heading above the chart in each of your custom components: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } const versionBSignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-b-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 20 }, { x: 10, y: 5 }, { x: 20, y: 25 }, { x: 30, y: 45 }, { x: 40, y: 50 }, { x: 50, y: 35 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionASignups, versionBSignups]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [ { \"endDate\": \"12-15-2020\", \"versionADescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was green.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was blue.\", \"winner\": \"A\" }, { \"endDate\": \"09-06-2019\", \"versionADescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a carousel.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a grid.\", \"winner\": \"B\" } ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { const versionATotals = { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[versionATotals]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Notice the new <div> tag in each render(), which allows you to return multiple elements at once. Also, remember that we provided you a CSS stylesheet that styles the chartHeader class. You can look at nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss to see more. You don't need to modify your Nerdlet's render() method in index.js because your components encapsulate the new code. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see that your charts have descriptive headings. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Well done! You've created all the charts that are laid out in your design guide. You’ve also organized them into a neat grid and added headings so that the charts are intelligible. While chart headings helps you understand what each chart shows, it'd be nice to add descriptions to help you remember what each version in your A/B test represents. In the next lesson, you'll add a description for each design version. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add version descriptions, before starting this one. In this course, you’re building an A/B test application in New Relic. The application presents a lot of data, through its charts, about the effectiveness of each design version you’re testing on your demo website. Ultimately, you’ll be able to use that data to decide which design is most effective and show that design to every user who visits your site. In this lesson, you’ll build a form into your application that lets you choose which design you want to show to every user of your site. Before writing any code, look at your design guide to review the section you’re going to build: This new section has three main components: A heading with instructional copy: \"Pick a version to end the test\" A component that you use to crown the winning version of the A/B test A button to confirm the winner that you selected Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-end-test-section/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named end-test.js: bash Copy $ touch end-test.js Step 3 of 10 In this new file, create a VersionSelector component to encapsulate a Select and its SelectItem child components: import React from 'react'; import { Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy VersionSelector renders a Select component with two choices. In each SelectItem, you specify a value prop. In this case, you use 'A' to represent version A and 'B' to represent version B. Step 4 of 10 Create another component for a Button you'll use to make your test as ended: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Select, SelectItem } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy This looks trivial, but it will encapsulate button logic as you iterate on your app code. Step 5 of 10 Create a final component for the entire section you'll use to mark the end of your test: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you create a Grid with three items. First, you create a GridItem that contains a HeadingText and spans all 12 columns. In the next row, you have two items: The VersionSelector component you created in the previous step A Button which reads \"End test\" These items each span one column, but instead of using columnSpan, they use a combination of columnStart and columnEnd to specify which columns they cover. Step 6 of 10 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, add EndTestSection to your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-end-test-section/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. However, you need to make a few improvements to this code. When you select a version, the selected value in the component doesn't change. You must control the value that Select displays using its value prop and onChange event handler. In the next lesson, you’ll update your code to persist your version choice in the Select component. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Persist the selected version.",

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User. For more information on the various NerdStorage components, please visit the New Relic developer website API documentation.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you learned of a third-party service that you can use to fetch mock cancellation data for the Total cancellations per version chart in your New Relic One application. Even though the data in this service is fake, the real value of this lesson is learning how you can use third party services to supply data to your New Relic One application. If you make a request to the mock service with cancellation data (https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations) you'll see a response rejecting your request with a message that reads \"Unauthorized\": bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations Unauthorized This is because the Nerdsletter API requires an Authorization header. More specifically, you must pass a bearer token of ABC123 to gain authorized access to its data. If you make a request to the service with the header Authorization: Bearer ABC123, you'll get a successful response with the mocked cancellation data: bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations -H 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' {\"a\": 15, \"b\": 78} In the last lesson, you used NerdGraph to store this API token in your New Relic One application's NerdStorageVault data store. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component and logged its use to your browser's console. In this lesson, you follow up that log statement with a real request to the Nerdsletter API using your authorization token. Then, you supply the data from that external resource to your Total cancellations per version chart. Step 1 of 6 Change to the third-party-services/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/third-party-services/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 6 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js, make a request to api.nerdsletter.net with your API token. Save the results to state, and use that state in render(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { cancellations: [], lastToken: null } } generateChartData(data) { const cancellationsA = data ? data.a : 0; const cancellationsB = data ? data.b : 0; return [ { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsA }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsB }, ], }, ] } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`Requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) fetch( \"https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations\", {headers: {\"Authorization\": `Bearer ${this.props.token}`}} ).then( (response) => { if (response.status == 200) { return response.json() } else if (response.status == 401) { console.error(\"Incorrect auth header\") } else { console.error(response.text()) } } ).then( (data) => { if (data) { this.setState({ cancellations: this.generateChartData(data), lastToken: this.props.token }) } } ) } } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={this.state.cancellations} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy In this code, you initialize TotalCancellations.state.cancellations with zero for the y-value in each series instead of the previously hardcoded values. This helps to more realistically represent what the chart should show if your New Relic One app hasn't successfully requested data from the Nerdsletter API. Next, you use Javascript's fetch() function to make an HTTP request to the Nerdsletter API. You then pass your token in the request's Authorization header. If the request is successful, you update the cancellation data in TotalCancellations.state so that that data is reflected in the component's render method. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/third-party-service/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. If your token in NerdStorageVault is not \"ABC123\", then your console will show an error that reads, \"Incorrect auth header\": If you set the token to \"ABC123\", then Total cancellations per version updates to show the values from the third-party service: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great job! You've come a long way from running nr1 nerdpack:create for the first time. Take a look back at your design guide to see that your application now has everything from an interface and data perspective that you planned from the beginning: You've created eight charts with varying styles and supplied them with dynamic data from multiple sources. You've learned about the New Relic One SDK and used many of its components. You've even gathered data from a third-party service and mixed it seemlessly with your New Relic data to provide a complete look at how the competing versions in your A/B test perform against each other. From here, there is only one more set of APIs in the New Relic One SDK that you've yet to get your hands on: Platform APIs. These will come in handy in improving the usability of your New Relic One application.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add NrqlQuery components to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In this series, you're creating a New Relic One application, or NR1 app for short, that shows A/B test data in a variety of charts. Most of the charts need to show data that comes from a demo service you spun up at the beginning of this series. To refresh your memory on what you're building, review your design guide: In the last lesson, you supplied real data, which comes from New Relic's database, to the following charts: Newsletter subscriptions per version Version A - Page views Version B - Page views Total subscriptions per version Because you have experience querying subscription and page view data, you may feel ready to supply data to even more charts: Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions However, these charts are different than the charts you've supplied data to because they compare data from two different sources: subscription events and pageView events. In this lesson, you learn how to format data from multiple sources to exist in the same chart. Experiment with data in the Data explorer Step 1 of 6 From your New Relic homepage's top navigation menu, go to to the Data explorer: Here, you can experiment with subscription event and pageView event queries to make sure you fetch the right data in your app. Step 2 of 6 Select subscription from the Custom events menu: This queries NRDB for subscription event totals per minute over the last 30 minutes and shows that data in a chart: Step 3 of 6 Click Dimensions to see a list of the attributes associated with these subscription events: You can filter and group subscription events using these dimensions. For Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, you want to filter your subscription totals by page_version. Step 4 of 6 Click the NRQL query to navigate to the Query builder: Here, you can view and manually edit the query to fetch the data you need. Step 5 of 6 Add a WHERE clause to filter subscription totals by page_version: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Remove the TIMESERIES clause to fetch a count: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO Copy Modify the SINCE clause to see totals over the past week: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO Copy Click Run and see the data visualized in a billboard chart instead of a line chart: Step 6 of 6 Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions need a combined total of four data values: All-time subscription totals for version A All-time page view totals for version A All-time subscription totals for version B All-time page view totals for version B Experiment with the Query builder to discover the four queries which pull the right data. In the end, you'll come up with the following four queries: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'b' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = 'b' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO Copy technical detail Unlike other structured query languages, NRQL doesn't provide a mechanism for joining data across sources. This is why you have to perform two queries to get subscription event totals and pageView event totals. Until now, you've provided every chart with a single query. Here, you have to provide two queries per chart. In the remaining steps, you'll learn how to customize NrqlQuery results to merge data from multiple sources. Merge NRQL from multiple sources Step 1 of 9 Change to the customize-nrql-data/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/customize-nrql-data/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 9 In your Nerdlet's totals.js file, implement constructor() and the React lifecycle method componentDidMount() in VersionTotals: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { tableData: { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } } } componentDidMount() { NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[0].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[1].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[this.state.tableData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Here, you initialize your state in the component's constructor. The state has a single value, tableData, which holds series data and metadata for the TableChart. In componentDidMount(), you query the data that populates the data in this state. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that is called when a component is mounted in the component tree. You use this method, instead of the constructor, to query data because your logic, which requests data from New Relic, introduces side effects and sets state values, neither of which you should do in the constructor. In componentDidMount(), you use NrqlQuery in a new way. First, you specified the formatType to NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW because you're going to modify the data instead of supplying it directly to a chart Before, you used its JSX form in the render() method of a chart. Second, you called its query() method and handled the results in a then() callback, which logs them to the console. Step 3 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, create a constant called ACCOUNT_ID and pass it to VersionTotals: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/ Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 4 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/customize-nrql-data/ab-test. Step 5 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 6 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Navigate to your app in New Relic. Step 7 of 9 To view your logs, which are useful for uncovering errors in your application, turn on developer tools in your favorite browser and navigate to the Console: FireFox instructions Safari instructions Chrome instructions With your app on-screen, notice the NRQL data in the console: This console log tells you that you can find the data you're looking for, namely the subscription or pageView count, at data.raw.results[0].count. The next step is to store that count in state.tableData. Tip If something doesn't work, use these debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 8 of 9 In totals.js, store the query data in state: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { tableData: { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } } } componentDidMount() { NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[0].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[1].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[this.state.tableData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Pay close attention to the data you're accessing. The array indices are particularly important to get right. The subscription data should go to state.tableData.data[0].count because in tableData, it is the first element in the data array: data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], Copy By similar logic, page view data should go to state.tableData.data[1].count. Step 9 of 9 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID In this lesson, you learned how to use NrqlQuery.query() to fetch data from multiple sources and stitch them together into data your chart can use. Notice that there are still two charts in your NR1 application that use mock data: Total unsubscriptions per version Past tests Unfortunately, your demo application doesn't create custom New Relic events when a user unsubscribes from your newsletter or you end an A/B test. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to populate Past tests.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorage from your nerdlet, before starting this one. Throughout this course, you're building a New Relic One application that gathers telemetry data from a demo web service that's running an A/B test on a newsletter signup form. The purpose of your New Relic One application is to help you understand how design changes impact the number of high quality newsletter subscriptions your service gets. The business objective, to increase your service's high quality newsletter subscriptions, relies primarily on three key pieces of information: Number of page views per version Number of subscriptions per version Number of cancellations Cancellations are important because if one design version of your newsletter signup form results in a high number of subscriptions but also a high number of cancellations, then those subscriptions are not as valuable. In previous lessons, you gathered data for page views and subscriptions from New Relic's database (NRDB), but you still need cancellation data. Your demo application does not report cancellation data to New Relic, so you need to fetch that data from an external source. We've provided a service at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations to return fake cancellation data for the purposes of this course. If you visit this URL in your browser, you'll see a brief message: \"Unauthorized\". This is because we created this service with a requirement that whoever requests its data must pass an Authorization header with the bearer token ABC123. So before you can request cancellation data from api.nerdsletter.net, you need to implement a few new behaviors in your application: Provide a mechanism for inputting an authorization token Persist the authorization token in a secure data store To input your authorization token, you'll use a Modal with a TextField. The secure data store you'll use is called NerdStorageVault. It's different from NerdStorage, which you used in the last lesson, because it only supports user storage and encrypts its data. Store your API token Step 1 of 3 Change to the add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 3 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, initialize state in AbTestNerdletNerdlet with a null token default: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Your Nerdlet uses this token state to manage the authorization token you'll later pass to the third-party service. However, a component's state is not a long-term solution for data management. For that, you need NerdStorageVault. Step 3 of 3 Implement a method, called storeToken(), which mutates NerdStorageVault data, and bind that method to the AbTestNerdletNerdlet instance: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy When you call storeToken() with a new token value, your Nerdlet uses NerdGraph APIs to mutate NerdStorageVault data for the api_token key. If the request to NerdGraph is successful, storeToken() updates state.token so that the new token is locally accessible. Unlike NerdStorage, which has query and mutation components for your convenience, NerdStorageVault has no components in the SDK. Instead, you have to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to interact with it Important It's important to remember that NerdStorageVault is limited to the user scope. Any other users of your New Relic One application will have their own NerdStorageVault data. This means that even other users on your account will need to enter their token separately. Query your API token Step 1 of 2 First, create methods and state to show and hide your API token prompt: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy state.hideTokenPrompt determines whether or not the prompt is visible. Now, you need a mechanism for revealing the prompt, which is hidden by default. Step 2 of 2 Query NerdStorageVault for your api_token: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, in componentDidMount(), you've queried NerdGraph for your api_token data. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that's called when your component is mounted in the component tree. This means that early in it's setup process, your application will request your api_token. If the NerdGraph query responds successfully with your token from NerdStorageVault, it sets the token in state. Otherwise, it shows the prompt so that you can enter a token. This is great for storing an initial token, but what if you enter the wrong token or the API changes? You need a way reveal the prompt on-demand. Next, you'll create the actual token prompt and a button to manually invoke the prompt. Create your token prompt Step 1 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named token-prompt.js: bash Copy $ touch token-prompt.js Step 2 of 9 In this new file, create a button that allows you to enter a new token on demand: import React from 'react'; import { Button } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenButton receives showPrompt() in its props and calls that method when its Button is clicked. Step 3 of 9 Create a token prompt using a Modal with a TextField: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy ApiTokenPrompt renders a Modal with a TextField, a Button, and an explanatory prompt. You use the Modal to enter your API token. It also provides basic error handling if you try to submit the form with no token value. It's important to distinguish the token in AbTestNerdletNerdlet.state and the token in ApiTokenPrompt.state. The token in your Nerdlet's state is the current token that your Nerdlet knows about. It's this token that matches what's in NerdStorageVault. The token in ApiTokenPrompt.state is a fluid value that changes as you update the text in the TextField. When you press Submit in the modal, ApiTokenPrompt submits its token to your Nerdlet's storeToken() method. Then, storeToken() mutates NerdStorageVault with the new token. You also implemented a few methods to improve the user experience: keyPress() submits the token when the RETURN key is pressed showTokenError() and hideTokenError() remind the user that they must enter a token before submitting the form Step 4 of 9 Export your components, so you can use them in your Nerdlet: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Modal, TextField, } from 'nr1'; class ApiTokenButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props) } render() { return ( <Button onClick={this.props.showPrompt}>Update API token</Button> ) } } class ApiTokenPrompt extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { token: null, tokenError: false, }; this.submitToken = this.submitToken.bind(this); this.hideTokenError = this.hideTokenError.bind(this); this.changeToken = this.changeToken.bind(this); this.keyPress = this.keyPress.bind(this); } showTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: true }); } hideTokenError() { this.setState({ tokenError: false }); } changeToken(event) { this.setState({ token: event.target.value }); } submitToken(event) { event.preventDefault(); if (this.state.token) { this.props.storeToken(this.state.token) this.hideTokenError() this.props.hidePrompt() } else { this.showTokenError() } } keyPress(event) { if(event.keyCode == 13) { event.preventDefault(); this.submitToken(event); } } render() { return <Modal hidden={this.props.hideTokenPrompt} onClose={this.props.hidePrompt}> To see cancellation data, you need to enter an API token for your backend service: <form> <TextField label=\"API token\" onChange={this.changeToken} onKeyDown={this.keyPress} invalid={this.state.tokenError ? \"Token required\" : false} /> <Button type={Button.TYPE.PRIMARY} onClick={this.submitToken}>Submit</Button> </form> </Modal> } } export { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/token-prompt.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import ApiTokenButton and ApiTokenPrompt and add them to render(): import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; import { ApiTokenButton, ApiTokenPrompt } from './token-prompt'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstoragevault/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you visit your application for the first time, the prompt is automatically revealed. Enter \"ABC123\" in the TextField, as that's the token that the third-party service expects. Once you submit your token and your Nerdlet hides the prompt, click Update API token at the bottom of your New Relic One application to reveal it again: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Pass your API token to TotalCancellations Step 1 of 3 In index.js, pass the API token to TotalCancellations so you're prepared to make a request to the third-party service: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem, NerdGraphMutation, NerdGraphQuery, } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views';

this.state = { hideTokenPrompt: true, token: null, } this.storeToken = this.storeToken.bind(this); this.showPrompt = this.showPrompt.bind(this); this.hidePrompt = this.hidePrompt.bind(this); } storeToken(newToken) { if (newToken != this.state.token) { const mutation = ` mutation($key: String!, $token: SecureValue!) { nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret( scope: { actor: CURRENT_USER } secret: { key: $key, value: $token } ) { status errors { message type } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", token: newToken, }; NerdGraphMutation.mutate({ mutation: mutation, variables: variables }).then( (data) => { if (data.data.nerdStorageVaultWriteSecret.status === \"SUCCESS\") { this.setState({token: newToken}) } } ); } } showPrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: false }); } hidePrompt() { this.setState({ hideTokenPrompt: true }); } componentDidMount() { const query = ` query($key: String!) { actor { nerdStorageVault { secret(key: $key) { value } } } } `; const variables = { key: \"api_token\", }; NerdGraphQuery.query( { query: query, variables: variables, } ).then( ({ loading, error, data }) => { if (error) { console.error(error); this.showPrompt(); } if (data && data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret) { this.setState({ token: data.actor.nerdStorageVault.secret.value }) } else { this.showPrompt(); } } ) } render() { return <div> <ApiTokenPrompt hideTokenPrompt={this.state.hideTokenPrompt} hidePrompt={this.hidePrompt} showPrompt={this.showPrompt} storeToken={this.storeToken} /> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <TotalCancellations token={this.state.token} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <ApiTokenButton showPrompt={this.showPrompt} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 2 of 3 In total-cancellations.js, log the token to your browser console: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { lastToken: null } } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) this.setState({lastToken: this.props.token}) } } render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy Here, you've implemented another React lifecycle method, called componentDidUpdate(). Now, every time your Nerdlet's state.token changes, TotalCancellations gets a new token prop, which triggers componentDidUpdate(). In componentDidUpdate(), you check that the incoming token is not the same as the last token it knew about, which is stored in local state. If the incoming token is different, you log a message with the new token and update state.lastToken. This logic prepares your code for a future change to use your API token in a request to a third-party service. Step 3 of 3 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see the log from TotalCancellations in your browser's console: If you change your token, you'll see another log from TotalCancellations with your updated token. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now you know how to use NerdGraphQuery and NerdGraphMutation to manage data in NerdStorageVault! Remember, use NerdStorage for your New Relic One application's non-sensitive data and NerdStorageVault for the sensitive stuff like tokens, passwords, and other secrets. As a bonus, you created a way to manage your token in NerdStorageVault from the user interface. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component for later use. Whether it's been with NrqlQuery, AccountStorageQuery, AccountStorageMutation, NerdGraphQuery, or NerdGraphMutation, you've learned several ways to interact with New Relic data in your New Relic One application. But New Relic One applications aren't just another way to show New Relic data. The purpose of New Relic One applications is to show you how your software is helping you meet your business objectives. Sometimes, New Relic data is all you need to make that happen, but other times you need to look beyond New Relic for data to fill in the gaps.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the Instant Observability catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info AbTest (Nerdpack): description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

AbTestNerdlet (Nerdlet): displayName: AbTestNerdlet supportedEntityTypes.mode: NONE All the information from catalog shows here. Step 3 of 3 View your app in Instant Observability: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Subscribe to your New Relic One application.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you used PlatformStateContext from the New Relic One SDK to look up the time range that the user selected from the app's time picker. Now, you'll learn about another component that interacts with the New Relic platform: navigation. The navigation component lets you open entities, navigate to entities, and build Location objects for entities from your Nerdlet. You can also use navigation for other Nerdlets and launchers. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-navigation/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In newsletter-signups.js, create a new method, called NewsletterSignups.openApmEntity(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. This method uses navigation.openStackedEntity() to display your demo application's APM entity in a stacked view. Notice openApmEntity() requires your ENTITY_GUID. You need to locate that ID and store it in a constant. Step 3 of 10 Navigate to APM: See metadata for your Newsletter service: Copy the entity's GUID: Create an ENTITY_GUID constant: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and the entity GUID you just copied, respectively. Now, openApmEntity() knows what entity to show. Next, you need to create a button to invoke this method. Step 4 of 10 Create a button to show your APM entity: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you've created a button and configured it to call openApmEntity() when it's clicked. Step 5 of 10 Import Stack and StackItem: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. You'll use Stack and StackItem to lay out the button on the far right side of the same row that the HeadingText is on. Step 6 of 10 Lay out the Stack: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <Stack fullWidth> <StackItem grow={true}> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> </StackItem> <StackItem> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> </StackItem> </Stack> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you used a full-width Stack to set up the layout for the row. To make the HeadingText fill the entire row except the width of the button, you used the StackItem.grow prop. Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. Click App performance: Now you see the stacked entity: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively Congratulations! You're finished writing all the code you'll write for your New Relic One A/B test application. Now, you have an application reporting New Relic data from your demo service that is running an A/B test. You've created several charts, buttons, and other UI elements. And you've organized your components into a readable and usable view. On top of the visuals, you've supplied data to your charts from multiple data sources in and outside of New Relic. You've created some backend functionality which utilizes your New Relic One application's own data store. You've also utilized the platform APIs for interacting with platform UI and showing a stacked entity view. You've really accomplished a lot throughout this course, so far. There are only a few things left to do! First, is to learn how to publish and subscribe to your New Relic One application so that it can run on our platform instead of your own local server. Second, is to learn how to deal with some common issues you might see in New Relic One application development.

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add pie charts, before starting this one. In each hands-on lesson in this course, you have been adding something new to your A/B test application. You’ve spun up a new launcher and added multiple chart components to your Nerdlet. In this lesson, you’ll create two new TableChart components that display information about each version of your website, such as the ratio of customers who subscribe to those who unsubscribe. Review your design guide to understand where these tables will fit into your application: In this design guide, the TableChart components come after the pie charts you created in the last lesson. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-tables/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-tables/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named totals.js: bash Copy $ touch totals.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a component called VersionTotals to hold your first TableChart and some mock data: import React from 'react'; import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { const versionATotals = { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } return <TableChart data={[versionATotals]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy TableChart is different from PieChart and LineChart in three big ways. First of all, there are no color or viz metadata attributes in its series. TableChart has a standard visualization, so it ignores things like color, which don't apply. Second, the TableChart series have columns metadata attributes. columns determines the names of the columns on the table. Finally, TableChart series data use neither x nor y values. Instead, they use keys that match the table column and values that determine what goes into the row. Notice that VersionTotals takes a version prop and supplies it to the chart metadata's id and name fields. This allows you to use this same component to create a table for version A and B and eliminate duplicate code. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-tables/ab-test. Step 6 of 8 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 7 of 8 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the TableChart components displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Extra credit There is one more table in the design guide that records past tests. The columns for this table are: End Date: The end date for the test Version A Description: A description for version A Version B Description: A description for version B Winner: The version selected as the final design Try to build this table in your application with these column names and some fake data, without looking at a code sample. This practice will reinforce what you've learned in this lesson. If you need help, review the add-a-chart-group directory of the coursework repository, which corresponds to the next lesson in this course. This has the code for the PastTests component. Each chart you’ll add to your application throughout this course is unique in its type or in the data it presents. So far, you’ve created tables, pie charts, and a line chart, and they all function independently of one another.

This document describes the Enterprise-level HTTP requests page. Non-Enterprise accounts will see the legacy HTTP requests page. Find and use HTTP requests page To view mobile monitoring's HTTP requests page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > HTTP requests. Use our standard page functions to look for trends in the HTTP analysis charts. Target specific request and response attributes by grouping, sorting, and filtering the data. Understand HTTP request data Here are some places to find the most important HTTP request information: Response time chart The response time chart shows how your app's network calls are performing across percentiles. Use it to compare the average response time to the 1st, 50th, and 99th percentile. Percentiles let you filter out outliers that may be making your average response time higher than expected. HTTP errors and network failures chart This chart shows the unsuccessful network calls your app is experiencing. Select the chart title to go to the HTTP errors page for more detail on the errors and failures. Total requests Sort by Total requests to identify which network requests are being used most frequently. The reason this can be helpful is because your slowest network calls may be only infrequently used, while more frequently used requests might be more worthy of optimization even if they are not the slowest.

      "body": "This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model. Requirements Some notes on requirements: This tutorial is for users on our New Relic One user model. Creating access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we recommend you check out: Understand what an access grant is Videos that show the user management UI in action This tutorial will walk you through how to: Add users View available accounts Grant groups access to roles and accounts Create custom roles Add users to groups Add users Adding users to New Relic is a separate process from creating access grants. In other words, you can do either procedure first. The key point is that if you're trying to give a user access to a role or an account that they don't yet have, they won't have that access until they're both a) in a group and b) that group has the correct access grant (access to a specific role on a specific account). There are two ways to add users: With the user management UI (described below) With automated user management, also known as SCIM provisioning: use of this method means that groups are defined in your identity provider and so you can't edit a user's group from the New Relic UI. To add users from the UI: From the top right of the New Relic UI, click the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Relevant tips: For how to bulk edit users' user type, see Edit user type. When choosing a group, you can choose either one of our default groups or a custom group that you've defined an access grant for. For more on creating access grants, keep reading. View available accounts When thinking about creating access grants for granting access to different accounts, it can help you to understand what accounts there are in your organization. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant access to accounts and roles Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic: by creating an access grant, you assign a group access to a) a specific role on b) a specific account. By default, organizations on the New Relic One user model have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. To view existing access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. Even if you haven't created any custom access grants, you will see the default-created grants there that are present for our default groups. This is what you might see when you go to the Organization and access UI and view groups. The default available groups of Admin and User have access grants automatically created that grant users in those groups access to the roles associated with those groups and to the initial account those users were added in. To create a new access grant that gives a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're logged in with an original user model record, or because you don't have the ability to manage users. For more on such factors, see Factors affecting access. Choose one of the following: Existing: If there is already a group you want to add an access grant to, you can use this. For example, if you want to gives users in the default Admin or User group access to new accounts, you might choose this and then select the Admin Default or Admin User role. New: If you need to create a new group, choose this. You'll also need to choose the authentication domain that group is inside of (for an explanation of what \"Default\" means, see Default groups. If your organization strategy requires a good amount of restrictions over access to accounts and access to roles, you'll probably need to create a good amount of access grants. Next, under Access grant, you'll choose one of following: Account: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are account-scoped. These are the roles that have to do with using and configuring our platform features (and not about organization and user management). Organization: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are organization-scoped. These are the roles that govern organization- and user management. (Note that these users must also already belong to an account-scoped role. This is true for most users but if it's not, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Select the Role you want to assign. Roles are organization-wide, so regardless of the authentication domain you're in, you have access to our standard roles and any custom roles you've created. For tips on selecting roles, see the tips after these instructions. Select the Account you want to add access to from the dropdown. If you don't see an account that you'd expect to see, this may be for a few reasons. One is that you yourself don't have the proper permissions for that account. Another is that that account is not actually in your organization. For more information, see Factors affecting access. If you are still having problems, talk to your account representative. If you want to continue adding more grants for that same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. When you're done, if your users are already in the group you've added the grant to, they should have access within a few minutes (although for EU region New Relic accounts, this can take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true if you just created an access grant with a new group), you'll need to go to the User management UI and add that group to those users. Some tips for using this UI: Note that if a user has the organization-scoped Organization manager and/or Authentication domain manager roles, which is true of users in the default Admin group, those users will always have those capabilities because those are organization-scoped abilities. This means that when you go to add those users to another account, you only have to add an account-scoped role, and not an organization-scoped role. In other words, once the users in a group have those organization-scoped roles, they will always have them in that organization unless removed. When selecting from amongst our standard roles, it's important to understand the difference between All product admin and Standard user. In short, All product admin is more popular a choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure them, you'd choose Standard user. If your users are managed via automated user management, there are some restrictions that may apply. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the User management UI to add users to groups, because groups are managed and imported from your identity provider. If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. Create custom role When creating an access grant, you can use our standard roles, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Review the list of available capabilities and decide which ones your custom role needs. For more information about how roles and capabilities work, see Capabilities. Once you're finished creating a custom role, you will probably want to use it in a new access grant. Add users to groups In the user management UI, you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to. Your users only have access to the access grants associated with the groups they've been added to. To view users and see their groups: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Step 4. Assign users and groups Next, you'll assign users in Okta's New Relic application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. Assignments tab In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Highly recommended: Set your users' time zones in Okta. The time zone affects how date/times for that user are shown in New Relic. Users without a time zone configured will be shown in UTC time in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). There are several ways in Okta to assign users' time zone, so consult the Okta docs for more information if needed. Here is one way to do this in the Assignments tab: In the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Manage user type If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, the count of your full users is a billing factor. To change some of your users to free basic users, you have two choices: Manage user type from New Relic using the User management UI, OR Manage user type from Okta (described below). To manage your users' user type from Okta: Go to the New Relic authentication domain UI and click Enable Manage user type with SCIM. Note that when this is enabled, you can’t manage user type from the New Relic UI and can only manage it from Okta. Go into your Okta instance. The rest of these instructions are done from Okta. Next, you'll configure Okta to be able to send a new attribute nrUserType. Steps: Go to the Profile editor. In the Attributes section, click Add attribute. Set your settings to match the screenshot below (except for the variable name, which is created automatically). The only two fields that must match exactly are External name and External namespace. The value for External namespace must be urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User Next, you'll configure your Okta user profile to have this field. Steps: In the Profile editor, go to Users and click the User (default) profile. Add a new New Relic user type attribute to that profile (see Okta user profile instructions). How you set this will depend on your own setup and preferences for defining user type. Note that the expected values for user type are Basic user and Full user. Below is an example with information filled in. In the People section, define the user type for your users. How you do this will depend on your setup and preferences. For example, you may choose to set this manually by setting each user’s user type, or you may use Okta to manage these in bulk. Next, you’ll set up mapping for that attribute. Steps: In the app's Provisioning section, click Unmapped attributes. Go into edit mode for the unmapped New Relic user type attribute. Configure it based on how you want to set the user type. To learn about why you'd set them as basic users or full users, see User type. Learn more about Okta attribute mappings. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you're able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add pie charts, before starting this one. In each hands-on lesson in this course, you have been adding something new to your A/B test application. You’ve spun up a new launcher and added multiple chart components to your Nerdlet. In this lesson, you’ll create two new TableChart components that display information about each version of your website, such as the ratio of customers who subscribe to those who unsubscribe. Review your design guide to understand where these tables will fit into your application: In this design guide, the TableChart components come after the pie charts you created in the last lesson. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-tables/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-tables/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named totals.js: bash Copy $ touch totals.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a component called VersionTotals to hold your first TableChart and some mock data: import React from 'react'; import { TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { const versionATotals = { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } return <TableChart data={[versionATotals]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy TableChart is different from PieChart and LineChart in three big ways. First of all, there are no color or viz metadata attributes in its series. TableChart has a standard visualization, so it ignores things like color, which don't apply. Second, the TableChart series have columns metadata attributes. columns determines the names of the columns on the table. Finally, TableChart series data use neither x nor y values. Instead, they use keys that match the table column and values that determine what goes into the row. Notice that VersionTotals takes a version prop and supplies it to the chart metadata's id and name fields. This allows you to use this same component to create a table for version A and B and eliminate duplicate code. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-tables/ab-test. Step 6 of 8 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 7 of 8 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the TableChart components displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Extra credit There is one more table in the design guide that records past tests. The columns for this table are: End Date: The end date for the test Version A Description: A description for version A Version B Description: A description for version B Winner: The version selected as the final design Try to build this table in your application with these column names and some fake data, without looking at a code sample. This practice will reinforce what you've learned in this lesson. If you need help, review the add-a-chart-group directory of the coursework repository, which corresponds to the next lesson in this course. This has the code for the PastTests component. Each chart you’ll add to your application throughout this course is unique in its type or in the data it presents. So far, you’ve created tables, pie charts, and a line chart, and they all function independently of one another. In the next lesson, you’ll create a couple more line charts, but this time they’ll function together. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. When you're ready, continue on to the next lesson: Add a chart group.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add chart components to your A/B test application, before starting this one. In this course, you’re building an A/B test application for the New Relic platform. Previously, you learned about the New Relic One SDK and its component library. Now, It’s time for you to start building your application focusing first on chart components. Before you write any code, consult your design guide to remember what the application will look like when you finish: There are several charts you need to create, which may seem overwhelming at first, but take it one step at a time. The topmost chart, and the first you’ll create, is a line chart that shows the number of users who sign up for your newsletter and what version of your website they were shown. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-your-first-chart/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-your-first-chart/ab-test This directory contains the code your application should have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named newsletter-signups.js: bash Copy $ touch newsletter-signups.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a component called NewsletterSignups to hold your first LineChart and some mock data: import React from 'react'; import { LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } const versionBSignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-b-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 20 }, { x: 10, y: 5 }, { x: 20, y: 25 }, { x: 30, y: 45 }, { x: 40, y: 50 }, { x: 50, y: 35 }, ], } return <LineChart data={[versionASignups, versionBSignups]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Here, you’ve created two arbitrary data series which represent versions A and B of your test. Right now, you're using manually-crafted data points. In the future, you'll replace these with data queried from New Relic. Notice that you’ve specified a color for each series in the chart. The color metadata attribute takes any CSS-acceptable color format. Setting viz: 'main' means that you want to render the LineChart series as a line, the component's default display style. For the data prop in the LineChart component, you passed the two series in an array so that both are represented together. Finally, you used the chart’s fullWidth prop to stretch the chart’s width to fill the view. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and replace the default heading in your Nerdlet's render() method with your new component: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-your-first-chart/ab-test.

This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 7 of 8 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the LineChart displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. In seven steps, you’ve breathed life into your New Relic One application. Instead of a bland “Hello world” message, your application now shows a colorful line chart with two mocked data series. These data series represent server-side traffic for each of the competing designs in your demo website. In the next lesson, you’ll build on this foundation by creating another chart type.

With New Relic dashboards, you observe and interpret the data you collect from your application. You gather the data you want to see into charts to customize the way you see it. In this procedure, you create a dashboard in New Relic. Create a dashboard Navigate to New Relic and sign in with your account. Here, you see different tabs such as Browse Data, Dashboards, Alerts & AI. Move to Dashboards and click Create a dashboard in the top right corner. Name your dashboard \"FlashDB\" and click create. Add charts to your dashboard Once the dashboard is in place, you can start creating charts. You're going to add the following charts: Database methods Average response time Errors Database size Cache hits Keys Database methods Hover over the dashboard and click Add a new chart. From this screen, you add charts using our query builder, or you choose to add text, images, or links using Markdown. Click Add a chart. It may open the query builder option. Switch to the NRQL editor and edit the query as follows: SELECT count(*) FROM fdb_method FACET method Copy Click Run to see above results. Here, you see the count of each FlashDB query, grouped by method. You can choose to present your results in different formats such as table, billboard, or pie chart. Change the chart type to pie, name your chart \"Database methods\", and click save. The chart is now visible on your dashboard. You can add more charts to your dashboard following the same pattern. To do so, click + in upper right hand corner. This takes you to the same Add to your dashboard page. Add another chart to your dashboard. Average response time Run the following query to observe the average response time of FlashDB queries.

Click Save to add this chart to your dashboard. Follow the same procedure to add the rest of the charts. Errors For the Errors chart, use the following query: SELECT sum(fdb_create_errors), sum(fdb_read_errors), sum(fdb_update_errors), sum(fdb_delete_errors) FROM Metric TIMESERIES Copy Here, you observe errors for all database queries. Database size Use the following query to get Database size chart. SELECT latest(fdb_size) FROM Metric Copy This chart shows you the database size. Cache hits For the Cache hits chart, use the following query: SELECT sum(fdb_cache_hits) FROM Metric TIMESERIES Copy Here, you observe the total number of cache hits using a line chart. Keys Use the following query to count the number of keys in your database. SELECT count(fdb_keys) FROM Metric TIMESERIES Copy Here, you observe the FlashDB key count.

      "body": "Most Nerdpacks in the Instant Observability catalog are open-source. This means you can clone or fork their repositories, customize them to suit your specific needs, and re-publish them to use with your account. In this guide, you customize a Nerdpack with visualizations and publish it to your account. However, to customize any Nerdpack, you follow the same steps. Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the first four steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI View a Nerdpack Subscribe to the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack and open the Circular progress bar visualization in New Relic. Step 1 of 6 From your homepage at New Relic, navigate to Instant Observability: Step 2 of 6 Click the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack in the catalog: Step 3 of 6 Add Victory Charts Visualizations to your account: Step 4 of 6 From Apps, open Custom visualizations: From the list of visualizations in Custom visualizations click Circular progress bar, which you installed as part of the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack. Step 5 of 6 Under Configure visualization properties, select your account and enter a NRQL query: Now you see a circular chart that shows a percentage based on your query. Tip Read our documentation for instructions on how to configure the progress bar visualization. Notice a few things about this visualization: You don't control the color of the chart The sections of the chart have rounded edges For the sake of this tutorial, imagine this chart represents your data exactly how you want it to, except for two things. You'd like to use straight edges and control the chart's colors manually. In the real world you may come across Nerdpacks like this where you like what they offer, but you'd like them better if you could tweak them. Well, you can tweak them, and next, you'll learn how! Step 6 of 6 Because you're going to use a tweaked version of the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack instead of the one you subscribed to, you can unsubscribe from our version now. Clone a Nerdpack Find the source code repository from the Nerdpack's catalog entry and clone it to your local machine. Step 1 of 5 From your homepage at New Relic, navigate to Instant Observability: Step 2 of 5 Click the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack in the catalog: Step 3 of 5 Go to the Nerdpack's source code repository: All open-source Nerdpacks in the catalog have links to their source code in their catalog information. Step 4 of 5 Clone the repository: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:clone -r https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-victory-visualizations.git Now you have a local version of the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack! Notice that you used nr1 nerdpack:clone instead of git clone to copy the repo. nr1 nerdpack:clone offers built-in functionality to help keep your local copy distinct from the original Nerdpack in the Instant Observability public catalog. Specifically, it generates a new Nerdpack UUID so you don't have to do this yourself: bash Copy Re-generating UUID... Committing new UUID... If you change to the nr1-victory-visualizations directory, and look at the git log, you'll see the new commit: bash Copy $ git log -1 -p commit e356bb5b10c3ecc8f93bae66d5739e1676ee21ef (HEAD -> main) Author: New Relic CLI <nr1@newrelic.com> Date: Tue May 25 14:29:37 2021 -0400 \"chore: Auto-generated UUID\" diff --git a/nr1.json b/nr1.json index 054de52..7a107b5 100644 --- a/nr1.json +++ b/nr1.json @@ -1,6 +1,6 @@ { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", - \"id\": \"cf5f13d9-815f-4907-a21d-83d02fa2a4fb\", + \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"Victory charts visualizations\", \"description\": \"Visualizations built on top of Victory charts\" } Step 5 of 5 In nr1-victory-visualizations/nr1.json, change your Nerdpack's displayName: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"269055dd-67e8-4713-8da3-bff01c6a8687\", \"displayName\": \"My custom Victory Charts visualizations\", \"description\": \"Visualizations built on top of Victory charts\" } nr1-victory-visualizations/nr1.json Copy Now when you serve or publish your custom Nerdpack, you can easily distinguish it from the original. Customize a Nerdpack Tweak the Circular progress bar visualization to use straight edges and customizable colors. Circular progress bar renders a VictoryPie with some predefined fields. The fields you'll tweak are: colorScale cornerRadius Step 1 of 8 In your local Nerdpack, open nr1-victory-visualizations/visualizations/circular-progress-bar/nr1.json. nr1.json is the Circular progress bar visualization's metadata file. Use this file to add a configurable colorScale option, which corresponds to the colorScale field on VictoryPie.

While your local server is running, it automatically recognizes changes to index.js. So, view your visualization in your browser to see the update: Perfect! You cloned and updated the open-source Circular progress bar visualization from the Instant Observability catalog. The only thing left to do is publish your version to the catalog so your accounts can subscribe to it. Step 8 of 8 Now that you're ready to publish your Nerdpack, stop your local server with CTRL+C. Add a custom visualization to a dashboard Publish your version of the Victory charts Nerdpack to the catalog. Then subscribe to it and use your visualization in a dashboard. Tip Because you used nr1 clone to clone the Nerdpack's repository, your local copy already has its own UUID. This is a prerequisite for publishing your version to the Instant Observability catalog. If you used git clone to copy, you need to update the Nerdpack's UUID manually: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The new generated id is ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Step 1 of 6 From its root directory, publish your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 6 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Here, you subscribed to your Nerdpack with the CLI. This is effectively the same action you performed earlier in this guide within the web UI, but from your terminal. Step 3 of 6 Go to the Apps view in New Relic: Step 4 of 6 From Apps, open Custom visualizations: From here, click the Circular progress bar visualization. Update your visualization's configuration options like you did when you were serving your Nerdpack locally. Step 5 of 6 Click Add to dashboard: Step 6 of 6 Go to your dashboard and see your new, customized circular progress bar: Summary In this guide, you: Subscribed to a Nerdpack from the Instant Observability catalog Cloned an open-source Nerdpack Edited an existing visualization to meet your needs Published and subscribed to your own custom Nerdpack Added a visualization from your custom Nerdpack to a dashboard Now you know how to build off the foundation of open-source Nerdpacks, you can use the work of the New Relic developer community to fast-track the creation of apps and visualizations. Tip If you want to maintain your own version in a remote repository, consider forking the original repo.",

Change the appearance of your chart When you run your query in advanced (NRQL) mode or view your chart while using the data explorer to specify data, the query builder analyzes your data and applies a chart type that fits your data. For some queries, you'll have several options of chart types to choose from. To change chart type, use the Chart type menu to the right of the current chart. Each type in the list has a tooltip with information about using that type. Example of the chart type menu, showing a tooltip. Customize your charts While we try our best to optimize how we display your data, sometimes you may have other needs. To this end, you can customize charts to display information at your convenience. Tip Customizations are available depending on the chart type. Format date and time Tip For table and billboard charts. Customize the date and time format for tables and billboards: for each type of data, you can select if you want to leave it as it is, or modify the format as Numeric or Date. If data is a timestamp, you can choose how to represent the date and time: For numbers, select if you want us to auto-format them, or chose the number of decimals you want to see. Customize the Y axis Tip For line and area charts. On line charts and area charts you can adjust the Y axis to display the data within certain values by setting a minimum and maximum value for the axis. If no customization option is selected, dashboards automatically displays the full Y axis from 0 to the top value plus a margin. Enable or disable the legend Tip For line and area charts, and histograms. For line charts, area charts, and histograms, you can disable or enable the legend. Remove the other groups facet Tip For bar and pie charts, and tables. When faceting on bar charts, pie charts, or tables, and if the number of faceting on queries is larger than 2,000, the Other groups facet aggregates the rest of facets. With this customization you can select whether to see Other groups, or remove it. More chart-specific features For more chart type-specific features, see Chart types.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version If you already had the CLI, update it: bash Copy $ nr1 update Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start. You’re ready to build an application with the New Relic One CLI! Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "Imagine you've developed a website and instrumented it with New Relic's Browser monitoring. New Relic's core feature set provides a lot of information, but you want something custom. You want to decide if a new design for your site will better engage your users. In other words, you want to A/B test a design and make a decision based on the data. For this task, you could create a New Relic One application, using React, the New Relic One software development kit, and the limitless power of modern web technologies. New Relic One applications are built with one of web development's most popular JavaScript libraries: React. Because you have freedom when writing React code, you can customize your app logic, design your own components, or take advantage of the abundance of open source component libraries. So, for your A/B test app, if you want to write custom logic to end the test based on results, you can do so. The New Relic One software development kit (SDK) allows you to create, serve, publish, and deploy applications to New Relic One. It also provides a host of React components for gathering data, presenting information, handling user interactions, and more. You use components like Button and Dropdown to create an interactive experience that looks and feels native to New Relic. You use Table and Chart components to display data from your New Relic account or elsewhere. When building your A/B test application, you'd use the SDK's NrqlQuery component to fetch Browser data from your account. With custom React code, SDK components, and the wide world of open source libraries, you can create your A/B test application in New Relic One. But before you create one for yourself, you might want to check the app catalog to see if someone has beaten you to it! If the catalog already had an app for that, you could add it to your account with a couple clicks, another benefit of creating apps in New Relic One. Throughout this course, you’re going to build a real-world New Relic One application for running and managing A/B tests. You’ll visualize Browser data for your competing designs, see historical data from past tests, and even choose a winning design and end the test, all from your New Relic One application! But before you get into the weeds of building charts and making http requests, you need to learn what New Relic One applications are made of.

Before you build a quickstart, you need to spin up a docker container. The container consists of two important services: A python program that mimics the database and also provides functions for create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. It also makes use of newrelic_telemetry_sdk to send telemetry data to New Relic. A simulator service that generates dummy database traffic so you don't have to manually perform CRUD operations To spin up these services, you first need to set NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY environment variable. Prepare your environment On your local machine, set your license key in an environment variable: bash Copy $ export NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY=<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Your mock database uses this key to write telemetry data to New Relic. You can find your New Relic license key in your account settings. Spin up demo services Clone the lab repository from GitHub: bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/build-a-quickstart-lab.git This repository contains the code for Flashdb as well as the simulator for dummy database traffic. Navigate to the demo directory and execute the following commands to build and run docker image: bash Copy $ docker build -t flashdb . $ docker run -e NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY=$NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY flashdb Here, you build and run docker image that generates mock database traffic.

      "body": "Every time you deploy an application, you hope that it's efficient and error-free. The reality, however, is usually quite different. You might introduce a bug in a release, overlook an edge case, or rely on a broken dependency. These issues, and others, can result in bad user experiences. In this guide, you: Use the open-source New Relic demo-deployer to spin up the infrastructure for Acme Telco Lite, a fictional company. This demo scenario is part of our Demo Catalog and will simulate real-world issues in a controlled, demo environment Use New Relic to understand those issues from the perspective of a Telco Lite developer Use the deployer to tear down the resources you create Welcome to Acme Telco Lite! Acme Telco Lite is a mock telecom business that maintains an eCommerce website for its customers. The site's architecture has eight, interconnected microservices, plus a simulator: The simulator isn't part of the Telco Lite infrastructure, but it is part of the demo deployment. It runs scenarios against the application to create web traffic and generate interesting data in New Relic. Set up your environment Before you begin, follow the Prerequisites guide from the deployer's GitHub repository for a detailed walkthrough of how to set up your environment. For this guide, you can choose between Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host your deployment. The guide steps you through: Installing Docker & pulling the demo-deployer image locally Creating a user config file containing credentials for New Relic and your cloud provider Downloading a .pem key file (if your cloud provider is AWS) Once you're all set up, deploy Acme Telco Lite. Deploy Telco Lite It's time to deploy and instrument the Telco Lite services using demo-deployer. Copy the url for the demo that corresponds to the cloud provider you chose when you set up your environment: AWS Telco Lite Demo Azure Telco Lite Demo GCP Telco Lite Demo Follow the Deployment guide in the Demo Catalog repository for a thorough explanation of how to use the deployer in a local Docker environment. When you run the deployment script, make sure to pass the url you copied for <demo-url>. Tip Since Telco Lite contains several services, the deployment can take over half an hour. When the deloyer is finished, you should see some output stating that the deployment was successful: bash Copy [INFO] Executing Deployment [✔] Parsing and validating Deployment configuration success [✔] Provisioner success [✔] Installing On-Host instrumentation success [✔] Installing Services and instrumentations success [INFO] Deployment successful!

View your services With your services running in the cloud, log in to New Relic and select APM from the top navigation to see how your services are holding up: Yikes! The alerts, high response times, and red-colored indicators suggest things aren't well. Use New Relic to diagnose these issues, which are simultaneously affecting your services: Issue 1: The Warehouse Portal has abnormally high response times Issue 2: Multiple services are raising error alerts Tip Don't worry if you don't see all the same alerts. The simulator triggers issues at regular intervals, so you should start seeing these problems in New Relic within 30 minutes to an hour. Tear down Telco Lite When you're finished diagnosing all the issues effecting Telco Lite, follow the Teardown guide in the deployer's repository to tear down the services you created in your cloud provider. If you're still exploring, don't tear down your services, or you'll have to deploy them again later. Conclusion Congratulations, you're done! Throughout this tutorial, you: Used the demo-deployer to deploy Telco Lite to the cloud Used New Relic to investigate simulated issues in Telco Lite services Tore down all the infrastructural resources you created throughout this tutorial Hopefully, you learned a lot about using New Relic to investigate issues in your services.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you learned of a third-party service that you can use to fetch mock cancellation data for the Total cancellations per version chart in your New Relic One application. Even though the data in this service is fake, the real value of this lesson is learning how you can use third party services to supply data to your New Relic One application. If you make a request to the mock service with cancellation data (https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations) you'll see a response rejecting your request with a message that reads \"Unauthorized\": bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations Unauthorized This is because the Nerdsletter API requires an Authorization header. More specifically, you must pass a bearer token of ABC123 to gain authorized access to its data. If you make a request to the service with the header Authorization: Bearer ABC123, you'll get a successful response with the mocked cancellation data: bash Copy $ curl https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations -H 'Authorization: Bearer ABC123' {\"a\": 15, \"b\": 78} In the last lesson, you used NerdGraph to store this API token in your New Relic One application's NerdStorageVault data store. You also passed the token to your TotalCancellations component and logged its use to your browser's console. In this lesson, you follow up that log statement with a real request to the Nerdsletter API using your authorization token. Then, you supply the data from that external resource to your Total cancellations per version chart. Step 1 of 6 Change to the third-party-services/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/third-party-services/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 6 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js, make a request to api.nerdsletter.net with your API token. Save the results to state, and use that state in render(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { cancellations: [], lastToken: null } } generateChartData(data) { const cancellationsA = data ? data.a : 0; const cancellationsB = data ? data.b : 0; return [ { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsA }, ], }, { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: cancellationsB }, ], }, ] } componentDidUpdate() { if (this.props.token && this.props.token != this.state.lastToken) { console.log(`Requesting data with api token ${this.props.token}`) fetch( \"https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations\", {headers: {\"Authorization\": `Bearer ${this.props.token}`}} ).then( (response) => { if (response.status == 200) { return response.json() } else if (response.status == 401) { console.error(\"Incorrect auth header\") } else { console.error(response.text()) } } ).then( (data) => { if (data) { this.setState({ cancellations: this.generateChartData(data), lastToken: this.props.token }) } } ) } } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={this.state.cancellations} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy In this code, you initialize TotalCancellations.state.cancellations with zero for the y-value in each series instead of the previously hardcoded values. This helps to more realistically represent what the chart should show if your New Relic One app hasn't successfully requested data from the Nerdsletter API. Next, you use Javascript's fetch() function to make an HTTP request to the Nerdsletter API. You then pass your token in the request's Authorization header. If the request is successful, you update the cancellation data in TotalCancellations.state so that that data is reflected in the component's render method. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/third-party-service/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. If your token in NerdStorageVault is not \"ABC123\", then your console will show an error that reads, \"Incorrect auth header\": If you set the token to \"ABC123\", then Total cancellations per version updates to show the values from the third-party service: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great job! You've come a long way from running nr1 nerdpack:create for the first time. Take a look back at your design guide to see that your application now has everything from an interface and data perspective that you planned from the beginning: You've created eight charts with varying styles and supplied them with dynamic data from multiple sources. You've learned about the New Relic One SDK and used many of its components. You've even gathered data from a third-party service and mixed it seemlessly with your New Relic data to provide a complete look at how the competing versions in your A/B test perform against each other. From here, there is only one more set of APIs in the New Relic One SDK that you've yet to get your hands on: Platform APIs. These will come in handy in improving the usability of your New Relic One application.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you used PlatformStateContext from the New Relic One SDK to look up the time range that the user selected from the app's time picker. Now, you'll learn about another component that interacts with the New Relic platform: navigation. The navigation component lets you open entities, navigate to entities, and build Location objects for entities from your Nerdlet. You can also use navigation for other Nerdlets and launchers. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-navigation/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In newsletter-signups.js, create a new method, called NewsletterSignups.openApmEntity(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. This method uses navigation.openStackedEntity() to display your demo application's APM entity in a stacked view. Notice openApmEntity() requires your ENTITY_GUID. You need to locate that ID and store it in a constant. Step 3 of 10 Navigate to APM: See metadata for your Newsletter service: Copy the entity's GUID: Create an ENTITY_GUID constant: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and the entity GUID you just copied, respectively. Now, openApmEntity() knows what entity to show. Next, you need to create a button to invoke this method. Step 4 of 10 Create a button to show your APM entity: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you've created a button and configured it to call openApmEntity() when it's clicked. Step 5 of 10 Import Stack and StackItem: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. You'll use Stack and StackItem to lay out the button on the far right side of the same row that the HeadingText is on. Step 6 of 10 Lay out the Stack: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <Stack fullWidth> <StackItem grow={true}> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> </StackItem> <StackItem> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> </StackItem> </Stack> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you used a full-width Stack to set up the layout for the row. To make the HeadingText fill the entire row except the width of the button, you used the StackItem.grow prop. Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. Click App performance: Now you see the stacked entity: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively Congratulations! You're finished writing all the code you'll write for your New Relic One A/B test application. Now, you have an application reporting New Relic data from your demo service that is running an A/B test. You've created several charts, buttons, and other UI elements. And you've organized your components into a readable and usable view. On top of the visuals, you've supplied data to your charts from multiple data sources in and outside of New Relic. You've created some backend functionality which utilizes your New Relic One application's own data store. You've also utilized the platform APIs for interacting with platform UI and showing a stacked entity view. You've really accomplished a lot throughout this course, so far. There are only a few things left to do! First, is to learn how to publish and subscribe to your New Relic One application so that it can run on our platform instead of your own local server. Second, is to learn how to deal with some common issues you might see in New Relic One application development. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Describe your app for the catalog.",

      "body": "This guide steps you through the process of adding access to our time picker in the sample transaction overview application. The sample application provides an overview of the telemetry data showing your account's transactions by application, average response time, HTTP response codes, and transaction errors. When you enable the time picker, users can specify the time range of data to view. We also have a 12 minute video that covers the steps below. Before you begin To develop projects, you need our New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete steps 1–4 of the CLI quick start. In step 1, be sure to make a copy of the number preceding your account name. This is your accound ID, and you’ll need it later. Important If you've already installed the New Relic One CLI, but you can't remember your account ID, start the CLI quick start again, and then click the Get your API key down arrow. The account ID is the number preceding your account name. For additional details, see Set up your development environment. Prepare the time picker sample code To get started, complete these steps to update the application UUID (unique ID) and run the sample application locally: Step 1 of 7 If you haven't already done so, clone the example applications from our how-to GitHub repo. bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git Step 2 of 7 Change to the directory nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet: bash Copy $ cd nr1-how-to/add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet Step 3 of 7 In your preferred text editor, open index.js. Step 4 of 7 Replace <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID> with your account id: Important Your account ID is available in the CLI quick start (see Before you begin). this.accountId = <ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ID>; Copy Step 5 of 7 Change to the add-time-picker directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/add-time-picker Step 6 of 7 Execute these commands to update the UUID and serve the sample application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 7 of 7 Once the sample application is successfully served, go to the local version of New Relic One (https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local) click Apps, and click Add Time Picker. After launching the Add Time Picker application, you see a dashboard that gives an overview of the transactions in your New Relic account: By default, the application shows your data within the last 60 minutes. If you toggle the time picker, it doesn't update the charts because the transaction overview application isn't connected to the New Relic One platform. It has no access to the data from the time picker. In the following sections, you'll add the time picker to the example application and add the time to the queries. Import the PlatformStateContext component The first step in adding the time picker is to import the PlatformStateContext component. Important If you need more details about the PlatformStateContext example that follows, see the APIs and components page Here's what the PlatformStateContext component does: Wraps all of the code within the return statement of the render method Makes a function call passing in the New Relic platform state Returns all of the code within our current return statement Complete these steps: Step 1 of 5 In a text editor, open /add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet/index.js. Step 2 of 5 Add the PlatformStateContext component to the end of the import statement so it looks like this: import { Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 3 of 5 Just below the current return insert this code for the PlatformStateContext component: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { return ( // ADD THE CURRENT RETURN CODE HERE ) }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> Copy Step 4 of 5 Move the current application code so it is under the return of the platformState function call. The return statement should now look like this: return ( <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> ); Copy Step 5 of 5 Add a console.log statement to make sure you are seeing appropriate data. Insert the following code inside the PlatformState return statement just before the opening tag for the <Grid> component: /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */ console.log(platformState); Copy After you complete these steps, your browser console displays something like this: Add the time to the queries In your console, you should see some data from the New Relic platform state. Now you're ready to add timeRange data to update the charts in the transaction overview application. This step requires you to import the timeRangeToNrql utility method from the New Relic One community library. Important You can get more details on the New Relic One community library from our GitHub repo. This helper method takes your PlatformState.timeRange duration data, formats it from milliseconds, and returns a formatted SINCE statement to add to your NRQL. Step 1 of 4 Import the timeRangeToNrql method by inserting this line of code below the other import sections: Important You don't need to include the AccountDropdown from the community import example. import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; Copy Step 2 of 4 Pass the platformState to the timeRangeToNrql helper, and save its output as a since statement for later use: const since = timeRangeToNrql(platformState); Copy Step 3 of 4 After creating the since variable, go through the code in the PlatformStateContext return statement and concatenate the since variable in each of the existing chart component queries. Here's a TableChart example: <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview + since} />; Copy Step 4 of 4 After you update all of the chart components, confirm that the final index.js file looks similar to this: Important This completed sample code is in your nerdlet final.js. import React from 'react'; import { PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, PieChart, } from 'nr1'; import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community'; export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.accountId = 1; } render() { const avgResTime = `SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES AUTO `; const trxOverview = `FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) as 'Transactions', apdex(duration) as 'apdex', percentile(duration, 99, 95) FACET appName `; const errCount = `FROM TransactionError SELECT count(*) as 'Transaction Errors' FACET error.message `; const responseCodes = `SELECT count(*) as 'Response Code' FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode `; return ( <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { /* Taking a peek at the platformState */ console.log(platformState); const since = timeRangeToNrql(platformState); console.log(since); return ( <> <Grid className=\"primary-grid\" spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]} > <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Overview </HeadingText> <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Average Response Time </HeadingText> <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Response Code </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes + since} /> </main> </GridItem> <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={6}> <main className=\"primary-content full-height\"> <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4} > Transaction Errors </HeadingText> <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount + since} /> </main> </GridItem> </Grid> </> ); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> ); } } Copy Summary When you completed all the steps in this example, you successfully implemented the time picker in your application by importing the PlatformStateContext component and accessing its timePicker data object.",

      "info": "Intro to New Relic One SDK",
      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: allows you to configure your Nerdlet and write to your Nerdlet's URL state.",

Organizing charts is one way to clarify the information you're trying to convey to your users. Headings are another. Since you have several charts on the same page, use headings to describe the information they show. To remember what data each chart presents, consult your design guide: The design guide details what data each chart shows. Use those details to craft useful headings for your charts. Step 1 of 6 Change to the add-chart-headings/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-chart-headings/ab-test Step 2 of 6 In newsletter-signups.js, page-views.js, past-tests.js, total-cancellations.js, total-subscriptions.js, and totals.js, import HeadingText and add a descriptive heading above the chart in each of your custom components: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } const versionBSignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-b-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 20 }, { x: 10, y: 5 }, { x: 20, y: 25 }, { x: 30, y: 45 }, { x: 40, y: 50 }, { x: 50, y: 35 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionASignups, versionBSignups]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [ { \"endDate\": \"12-15-2020\", \"versionADescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was green.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The homepage's CTA button was blue.\", \"winner\": \"A\" }, { \"endDate\": \"09-06-2019\", \"versionADescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a carousel.\", \"versionBDescription\": \"The 'Deals' page showed sales in a grid.\", \"winner\": \"B\" } ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total cancellations per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-cancellations.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, TableChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { const versionATotals = { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[versionATotals]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Notice the new <div> tag in each render(), which allows you to return multiple elements at once. Also, remember that we provided you a CSS stylesheet that styles the chartHeader class. You can look at nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss to see more. You don't need to modify your Nerdlet's render() method in index.js because your components encapsulate the new code. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see that your charts have descriptive headings. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Well done! You've created all the charts that are laid out in your design guide. You’ve also organized them into a neat grid and added headings so that the charts are intelligible. While chart headings helps you understand what each chart shows, it'd be nice to add descriptions to help you remember what each version in your A/B test represents. In the next lesson, you'll add a description for each design version. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Present an end test confirmation modal, before starting this one. In this series, you're building a full-fledged New Relic One application that ingests data from a demo service that's running an A/B test. The app shows the A/B test data in interesting ways so that you'll ultimately be able to choose whether Version A or Version B is more effective at accomplishing your business goal: to increase high-quality newsletter subscriptions. In past tutorials, you created charts to visualize your data, and you organized those charts so you can use and understand them. You also created a form in your app for ending your test once you're confident in the most effective version. Until now, though, you can't gauge which version is more effective because your charts have been showing mock data, such as: const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } Copy A chart's data prop is useful for supplying manually-crafted data like this or even reformatted third-party data. But for many of your charts, you want to show real-time New Relic data. For example, Newsletter subscriptions by version should show subscription data, which exists in New Relic's database, NRDB for short. To query NRDB, you first need to know what data you're looking for. Remember your demo backend service? Well, that service reports a subscription event to New Relic when a user subscribes to a newsletter from your site. You can view these subscription events in New Relic while your demo services are running. View Subscription Events in New Relic Before you query NRDB from your charts, experiment with querying data from New Relic's web interface. Step 1 of 3 From your New Relic homepage, go to to the Data explorer from the top navigation menu: Data explorer lets you explore your telemetry data: metrics events logs traces Since the backend submits newsletter subscriptions as events to New Relic, you can see them in this view. Step 2 of 3 Select subscription from the Custom events menu: This queries NRDB for subscription event totals per minute over the last 30 minutes and shows that data in a chart: Step 3 of 3 Click Dimensions to see a list of the attributes associated with these subscription events: You can filter and group subscription events using these dimensions. Notice the NRQL query above the chart. This shows the chart's underlying query, which is based on these dimensions. Click the page-version dimension to see the query change to group by FACET page_version: The Data explorer presents two options for filtering and sorting your data: User interface (UI) selections like the one you've just made New Relic Query Language (NRQL) The UI is useful for quickly filtering data, and it doesn't require you to know NRQL. For your New Relic One application, however, you need to use NRQL queries. Click the NRQL query to navigate to the Query builder: Here, you can view and manually edit the query to fetch the data you need. Update NewsletterSignups with a NrqlQuery Before you begin integrating New Relic data in your NR1 app, consult your design guide: Your New Relic One application has eight charts in total, including line charts, pie charts, and table charts. Each of these charts currently shows mock data, but they need to show real data to be useful. First, focus on querying data for the topmost chart: Newsletter subscriptions per version. With the query you've built in the Data explorer, you already have the data you need for this chart: Technical detail In your query, you fetch subscription totals (SELECT count(*) FROM subscriptions), group them by their page version (FACET page_version), and focus the timeseries to the past 30 minutes (SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES). Explore our documentation to learn more about NRQL queries. Next, you learn how to pass your NRQL query to your Newsletter subscriptions per version chart. Step 1 of 7 Change to the add-nrql-components/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nrql-components/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, update the LineChart in NewsletterSignups. Remove the mock data, and use the NRQL query you built in the Data explorer: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. In NrqlQuery, you set two props: accountId: The id for the account you query from query: The query to perform With these, your NR1 app can query the data you want to show in your chart. Tip There is a convenience prop for using NRQL to supply data to your charts, called query. If you'd rather not use the NrqlQuery component, try the query prop instead: <LineChart accountId={<YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID>} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" /> Copy Keep in mind you must still supply the accountId. Step 3 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nrql-components/ab-test. Step 4 of 7 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 7 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 7 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: Newsletter subscriptions by version now shows real data from New Relic's database rather than the mock data you defined before. Notice that your chart pulls data when your application loads, but does not continue pulling data while the application is open. You can fix this by adding another prop. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 7 of 7 Add a pollInterval: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. The pollInterval is the number of milliseconds between chart refreshes. Each time the chart refreshes, it queries fresh data from New Relic. In this case, you refresh every minute. Populate your PieChart with subscription event data Now that you've seen how to passed New Relic data to Newsletter subscriptions per version, it's time to move on to Total subscriptions per version. These two charts are similar in that they compare subscription event data grouped by version. The primary differences between Newsletter subscriptions per version and Total subscriptions per version are: One is a line chart and one is a pie chart One shows timeseries data and one shows all-time totals Step 1 of 2 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js, update the TestDistributions component, removing the mock data and populating the PieChart with the same NRQL query you used for Newsletter subscriptions per version but with different TIMESERIES and SINCE clauses: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, PieChart, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 7 DAYS AGO\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <PieChart data={data} fullWidth /> } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. You don't need the TIMESERIES clause because the pie chart only shows numerical data. You don't need the SINCE clause because Total subscriptions per version needs to show all-time subscription totals. Step 2 of 2 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: Total subscriptions per version now shows all-time subscription totals from both versions of your demo application. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Well done! You've configured some charts to query real subscription data from New Relic's database. Populate charts with pageView event data Consider the remaining charts that still use mock data: Total unsubscriptions per version Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions Version A - Page views Version B - Page views Past tests Some of these charts need to show page view data. Fortunately, your demo application creates a custom event for every page view like it does for subscriptions! Since Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions require data from two sources, ignore these for now and focus on Version A - Page views and Version B - Page views. Step 1 of 2 In page-views.js, remove the mock data from VersionPageViews and use a NrqlQuery component to supply a query: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 2 of 2 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: In these new queries, you fetch pageView custom events instead of subscription events. You also use a WHERE clause to filter to a particular page_version rather than a FACET to group by page_version. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Phew, that's a lot of queries, but your application looks great! You're now showing real data in four charts. Remember the two charts you ignored because they require data from two sources? Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions You have to handle these differently than you did for the charts you've been dealing with because NRQL has no method for querying data from multiple sources. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to supply data to these two charts. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow detail Event flow starts aggregating data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Event timer detail Like event flow, event timer only starts aggregating data when data arrives. When a data point arrives, a timer starts to count down. If no data arrives before the timer counts down, the data is evaluated. When a data point arrives before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 15 seconds and 15 minutes, in 15-second increments. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with None, the last value received, or a static value. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values.

Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). If the name begins with anything other than an alphabetical character, enclose the name with backticks in your NRQL query. For example: FROM `0_hello` SELECT count(*) Copy Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize NRQL data, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you created a user experience in your application which includes charts and a button to end your A/B test. You also configured your charts to query real data from New Relic's database. However, you left mock data in two charts: Past tests Total cancellations per version Both of these charts hold data that you can't get from New Relic. Past tests shows historical test information, whereas Total cancellations per version shows the number of cancellations each version sees over time. Focus, first on Past tests. Past tests shows historical test information, so you need to store information about each test upon completion. And you have all the tools you need to accomplish this task. First, you have an End test button that triggers the save action. Second, you know how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to hold the test information. Save test information to NerdStorage Step 1 of 5 Change to the add-nerdstorage/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { this[index] = { endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, } }, data ) historicalData.data = data return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data, format it according to the TableChart specifications, and set it on historicalData.data. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add a section to end your test, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you created a section of your application that allows you to pick the most effective design from your A/B test. The goal of this section is to end the test once you’ve selected a winner: When you select a version from this form, the selection does not persist in the Select component. Now, it’s time to implement that behavior. Step 1 of 11 Change to the persist-selected-version/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/persist-selected-version/ab-test Step 2 of 11 In end-test.js, initialize EndTestSection.state with a default selectedVersion field: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 3 of 11 Pass the selectedVersion, as a prop, to VersionSelector: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { render() { return <Select> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 4 of 11 Supply the selectedVersion to your Select component in VersionSelector: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 5 of 11 Create a method, selectVersion(), that updates EndTestSection.state: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy You must bind selectVersion to the EndTestSection component so it can access state. Step 6 of 11 Pass the method to VersionSelector as a prop: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 7 of 11 Set selectVersion as the onChange callback in VersionSelector: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Step 8 of 11 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/persist-selected-version/ab-test. Step 9 of 11 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 10 of 11 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 11 of 11 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Present an end test confirmation modal, before starting this one. In this series, you're building a full-fledged New Relic One application that ingests data from a demo service that's running an A/B test. The app shows the A/B test data in interesting ways so that you'll ultimately be able to choose whether Version A or Version B is more effective at accomplishing your business goal: to increase high-quality newsletter subscriptions. In past tutorials, you created charts to visualize your data, and you organized those charts so you can use and understand them. You also created a form in your app for ending your test once you're confident in the most effective version. Until now, though, you can't gauge which version is more effective because your charts have been showing mock data, such as: const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } Copy A chart's data prop is useful for supplying manually-crafted data like this or even reformatted third-party data. But for many of your charts, you want to show real-time New Relic data. For example, Newsletter subscriptions by version should show subscription data, which exists in New Relic's database, NRDB for short. To query NRDB, you first need to know what data you're looking for. Remember your demo backend service? Well, that service reports a subscription event to New Relic when a user subscribes to a newsletter from your site. You can view these subscription events in New Relic while your demo services are running. View Subscription Events in New Relic Before you query NRDB from your charts, experiment with querying data from New Relic's web interface. Step 1 of 3 From your New Relic homepage, go to to the Data explorer from the top navigation menu: Data explorer lets you explore your telemetry data: metrics events logs traces Since the backend submits newsletter subscriptions as events to New Relic, you can see them in this view. Step 2 of 3 Select subscription from the Custom events menu: This queries NRDB for subscription event totals per minute over the last 30 minutes and shows that data in a chart: Step 3 of 3 Click Dimensions to see a list of the attributes associated with these subscription events: You can filter and group subscription events using these dimensions. Notice the NRQL query above the chart. This shows the chart's underlying query, which is based on these dimensions. Click the page-version dimension to see the query change to group by FACET page_version: The Data explorer presents two options for filtering and sorting your data: User interface (UI) selections like the one you've just made New Relic Query Language (NRQL) The UI is useful for quickly filtering data, and it doesn't require you to know NRQL. For your New Relic One application, however, you need to use NRQL queries. Click the NRQL query to navigate to the Query builder: Here, you can view and manually edit the query to fetch the data you need. Update NewsletterSignups with a NrqlQuery Before you begin integrating New Relic data in your NR1 app, consult your design guide: Your New Relic One application has eight charts in total, including line charts, pie charts, and table charts. Each of these charts currently shows mock data, but they need to show real data to be useful. First, focus on querying data for the topmost chart: Newsletter subscriptions per version. With the query you've built in the Data explorer, you already have the data you need for this chart: Technical detail In your query, you fetch subscription totals (SELECT count(*) FROM subscriptions), group them by their page version (FACET page_version), and focus the timeseries to the past 30 minutes (SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES). Explore our documentation to learn more about NRQL queries. Next, you learn how to pass your NRQL query to your Newsletter subscriptions per version chart. Step 1 of 7 Change to the add-nrql-components/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-nrql-components/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, update the LineChart in NewsletterSignups. Remove the mock data, and use the NRQL query you built in the Data explorer: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. In NrqlQuery, you set two props: accountId: The id for the account you query from query: The query to perform With these, your NR1 app can query the data you want to show in your chart. Tip There is a convenience prop for using NRQL to supply data to your charts, called query. If you'd rather not use the NrqlQuery component, try the query prop instead: <LineChart accountId={<YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID>} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" /> Copy Keep in mind you must still supply the accountId. Step 3 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nrql-components/ab-test. Step 4 of 7 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 7 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 7 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: Newsletter subscriptions by version now shows real data from New Relic's database rather than the mock data you defined before. Notice that your chart pulls data when your application loads, but does not continue pulling data while the application is open. You can fix this by adding another prop. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 7 of 7 Add a pollInterval: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. The pollInterval is the number of milliseconds between chart refreshes. Each time the chart refreshes, it queries fresh data from New Relic. In this case, you refresh every minute. Populate your PieChart with subscription event data Now that you've seen how to passed New Relic data to Newsletter subscriptions per version, it's time to move on to Total subscriptions per version. These two charts are similar in that they compare subscription event data grouped by version. The primary differences between Newsletter subscriptions per version and Total subscriptions per version are: One is a line chart and one is a pie chart One shows timeseries data and one shows all-time totals Step 1 of 2 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js, update the TestDistributions component, removing the mock data and populating the PieChart with the same NRQL query you used for Newsletter subscriptions per version but with different TIMESERIES and SINCE clauses: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, PieChart, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Total subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 7 DAYS AGO\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <PieChart data={data} fullWidth /> } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. You don't need the TIMESERIES clause because the pie chart only shows numerical data. You don't need the SINCE clause because Total subscriptions per version needs to show all-time subscription totals. Step 2 of 2 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: Total subscriptions per version now shows all-time subscription totals from both versions of your demo application. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Well done! You've configured some charts to query real subscription data from New Relic's database. Populate charts with pageView event data Consider the remaining charts that still use mock data: Total unsubscriptions per version Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions Version A - Page views Version B - Page views Past tests Some of these charts need to show page view data. Fortunately, your demo application creates a custom event for every page view like it does for subscriptions! Since Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions require data from two sources, ignore these for now and focus on Version A - Page views and Version B - Page views. Step 1 of 2 In page-views.js, remove the mock data from VersionPageViews and use a NrqlQuery component to supply a query: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 2 of 2 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: In these new queries, you fetch pageView custom events instead of subscription events. You also use a WHERE clause to filter to a particular page_version rather than a FACET to group by page_version. Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Phew, that's a lot of queries, but your application looks great! You're now showing real data in four charts. Remember the two charts you ignored because they require data from two sources? Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions You have to handle these differently than you did for the charts you've been dealing with because NRQL has no method for querying data from multiple sources. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to supply data to these two charts. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

Step 2 of 5 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, create a method, EndTestButton.endTest(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy With this code, you build a formatted date string, endDate. Then, you mutate account storage with a call to AccountStorageMutation.mutate(). You pass your account identifier, the WRITE_DOCUMENT action type, \"past-tests\" as the collection name, endDate as the documentId, and the document data, which includes the version descriptions and the winner. You pass WRITE_DOCUMENT because you're either creating a new document or updating a document, if one with a matching collection and documentId already exists. documentId is endDate, which is helpful for only creating one record per day. Tip If you suspected you might complete multiple tests in one day, you'd need to change this logic. Step 3 of 5 Notice this.props.closeModal() at the end of the method. This closes the modal that shows when you try to end a test. Therefore, you can replace the onClick callback for your Yes, end test button in EndTestButton.render(): import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy When you end the test, endTest stores your test data in account storage and closes the modal. This is only half the behavior you need to populate your table, you also need to query this collection from account storage. Step 4 of 5 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass the account ID and version descriptions to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, EndTestSection can access these variables in its props. Step 5 of 5 Forward your account ID and version descriptions from EndTestSection to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageMutation, BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); this.endTest = this.endTest.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } endTest() { const today = new Date(); const dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0'); const mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); const yyyy = today.getFullYear(); const endDate = `${mm}-${dd}-${yyyy}` AccountStorageMutation.mutate( { accountId: this.props.accountId, actionType: AccountStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: \"past-tests\", documentId: endDate, document: { versionADescription: this.props.versionADescription, versionBDescription: this.props.versionBDescription, winner: this.props.selectedVersion, } } ) this.closeModal(); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.endTest}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton accountId={this.props.accountId} selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} versionADescription={this.props.versionADescription} versionBDescription={this.props.versionBDescription} > End test </EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Fetch test information from NerdStorage Step 1 of 6 In past-tests.js, update PastTests to fetch data from account storage and display it in the TableChart: import React from 'react'; import { AccountStorageQuery, HeadingText, Spinner, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class PastTests extends React.Component { render() { const historicalData = { metadata: { id: 'past-tests', name: 'Past tests', columns: ['endDate', 'versionADescription', 'versionBDescription', 'winner'], }, data: [], } return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Past tests </HeadingText> <AccountStorageQuery accountId={this.props.accountId} collection=\"past-tests\"> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner />; } if (error) { console.debug(error); return 'There was an error fetching your data.'; } data.forEach( function (currentValue, index) { this[index] = { endDate: currentValue.id, versionADescription: currentValue.document.versionADescription, versionBDescription: currentValue.document.versionBDescription, winner: currentValue.document.winner, } }, data ) historicalData.data = data return <TableChart data={[historicalData]} fullWidth /> }} </AccountStorageQuery> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/past-tests.js Copy First, you removed the mocked data from historicalData. Then, you used AccountStorageQuery to fetch data from NerdStorage. You passed your account identifier and the name of the collection in which you stored the document. Notice that there are three return values from the query: loading error data If the query is in progress, loading is true. In this case, you show a Spinner user interface component to let users know that the table isn't yet ready. If the query returned an error, you can see information about that error in the error variable. You log that information to the console for debugging purposes and return an error message. If the query returned successfully, you can access the data in the data variable. Because the data doesn't match the format that the TableChart requires, you loop through the data, format it according to the TableChart specifications, and set it on historicalData.data. Finally, you pass historicalData to your TableChart. Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, pass your ACCOUNT_ID to PastTests: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <EndTestSection accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} versionADescription={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} versionBDescription={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <PastTests accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-nerdstorage/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. At first, you should see no data: Click End test and approve your action in the modal. Now, you see data in Past tests: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Great work! You now have experience using the NerdStorage query and mutation components. However, there's still one more chart with mocked data: Total cancellations per version. Total cancellations per version is different from the other charts in your A/B test application. Because New Relic knows nothing about how many users unsubscribe to your newsletter, you need to request that information from an external source. For the purposes of this course, we've created an external data service that provides fake newsletter cancellation data for you to consume in your application. This mock service lives at https://api.nerdsletter.net/cancellations. New Relic One applications are React applications, which means that you can use React and Javascript facilities to gather data not only from New Relic, but any external service. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to look beyond New Relic for data that will inform you of how your software is helping you achieve your business objectives. But before you learn that, you need to know something about our mock data service: it requires an Authorization header! In this lesson, you learned how to use NerdStorage to query and mutate data in your application's own data store. While NerdStorage is a great place for many categories of data, it's not appropriate for sensitive data, like a token you would pass in an Authorization header to an external service. For that, you'd use NerdStorageVault. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Access NerdStorageVault from your nerdlet.",

      "body": "You can proactively monitor your website or API endpoints with synthetic monitors. Depending on the type of monitor, you can: Add and edit monitors. Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Hover an element Navigate to a URL Secure a credential Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results.",

Before you build your New Relic One application, you need to spin up your demo services. This coursework depends on two important services: A web service that shows a newsletter signup form. The form's heading text alternates between two versions because you're performing an A/B test to determine which text leads to more high-quality subscriptions. A simulator service that sends steady traffic to the website so that you don't have to manually generate data To spin up your demo services, you first need to install Docker and Docker compose. Spin up your demo services Step 1 of 5 Clone the coursework repository from GitHub: bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course This repository contains code for creating NodeJS New Relic automations. It also contains a an app code directory for each lesson in the course. You'll use these directories to follow along with the course content. Step 2 of 5 Change to the demo directory, called ab-test-app: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/ab-test-app This directory contains configuration files and READMEs for using the demo. Step 3 of 5 Build and run the web service and simulator containers, using docker-compose: bash Copy $ NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=<your New Relic license key> docker-compose up -d Important Make sure you replace <your New Relic license key> with your actual license key. Once it's finished, view the website at localhost:3001: Step 4 of 5 Visit New Relic, and navigate to APM in the top navigation menu. Select Newsletter from the list of instrumented services: You may have to wait a minute or two for New Relic to recieve data from your demo services. Once it's ready, you'll see transaction data, such as performance, throughput, and an Apdex score: Step 5 of 5 To spin down your demo services, run docker-compose down from your ab-test-app directory: bash Copy $ docker-compose down Now you're ready to build your New Relic One application!

Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install and configure the New Relic One CLI Create a Nerdpack Step 1 of 5 Update your CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 5 Create a Nerdpack with the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name entity-nerdlet This results in a Nerdpack, called entity-nerdlet, which consists of a launcher, called entity-nerdlet-launcher, and a Nerdlet, called entity-nerdlet-nerdlet. Step 3 of 5 Serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ cd entity-nerdlet $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 4 of 5 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and navigate to Apps: ?nerdpacks=local is required to enable your locally served Nerdpacks to load in New Relic. Step 5 of 5 Under Your apps, click your launcher to view your New Relic One application: Attach your Nerdlet to entities You've seen how you can access your Nerdlet from a launcher. Now, access your Nerdlet from your entities. Step 1 of 6 From inside your Nerdpack's root directory, open nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json. This is your Nerdlet's metadata file. You'll use this file to attach your Nerdlet to entities. Step 2 of 6 Add a context object with an entities array: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [] 8 } 9 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy This tells New Relic that you want to surface your Nerdlet in an array of entity contexts. Step 3 of 6 Add an entity context: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [ 8 { 9 \"domain\": \"APM\", 10 \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" 11 } 12 ] 13 } 14 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Here, you've attached your Nerdlet to all application entities in the APM domain. Step 4 of 6 Go to APM: Because you're serving your Nerdpack locally, remember that you must still specify the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 5 of 6 Choose any of your applications: Step 6 of 6 Scroll down to see your Nerdlet attached to the application: Click this menu option and see your Nerdlet the same way you did with the launcher. Configure your entities context The context.entities key in your Nerdlet's nr1.json file specifies which entities your Nerdlet should be attached to. Specify an entity domain Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity domain by specifying the domain as one of the following values: APM: Application Performance Monitoring BROWSER: Browser INFRA: Infrastructure monitoring MOBILE: Mobile monitoring SYNTH: Synthetic monitoring For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities in the APM domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those in a domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"!APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities in multiple domains: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" }] } } Copy Specify an entity type Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity type by specifying the type as one of the following values: APPLICATION HOST MONITOR For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities of the APPLICATION type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those of a specified type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"!APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity whose type matches one of an array of types: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }, { \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }] } } Copy Specify entity tags Attach your Nerdlet to entities that have a given tag. For example, attach your Nerdlet to the entity which has a particular GUID: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"guid\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ENTITY GUID>\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity which has particular accountId and uses the Python programming language: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"accountId\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ACCOUNT ID>\"] }, { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Combine filters When you filter the entities to which your Nerdlet will be added, you can combine domain, type, and tags: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"domain\": \"APM\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\", \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] }, { \"domain\": \"SYNTH\", \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" } ] } } Copy In this example, you've attached your Nerdlet to: All APM applications whose metadata tags specify the python language AND all Synthetic monitors AND all Browser entities",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Install and configure the New Relic One CLI, before starting this one. A Nerdpack is a package that contains all the files that make up a New Relic One application or visualization. Nerdpacks include files for metadata, Nerdlets, assets, and more. To create a Nerdpack, use the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack When nr1 prompts for a component name, use \"ab-test\" and watch the tool create the foundations of your Nerdpack. Once it's finished, explore the files it created for you. Root directory At the root level, you have a directory called ab-test. Everything inside this directory is part of the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls ab-test README.md nerdlets nr1.json package.json launchers node_modules package-lock.json Readme.md provides instructions for creating Nerdpack elements and serving your application locally. This and nr1 --help are useful if you forget how to interact with your Nerdpack using the command line tool. Javascript files package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules are important for running your JavaScript application, but aren't unique to Nerdpacks. You can learn about these modules from JavaScript courses should you need to tweak them. For now, take a look at nr1.json, one of the most relevant files in this directory. Metadata file nr1.json is the Nerdpack's metadata file, containing a schema type, unique identifier, a display name, and a description. Since you’re building a New Relic One application for running and analyzing A/B tests, update the package's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and set the description to \"A/B test your application using New Relic One\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"311bcd0c-f7eb-4285-afed-4219179bf91d\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"A/B test your application using New Relic One.\" } nr1.json Copy It's good to describe your application's purpose, especially if you're going to publish your application for others to use. Next, look at the launchers and nerdlets subdirectories. Launchers launchers is a directory because you can create multiple launchers for your New Relic One application. nr1 create only created one launcher for your Nerdpack and called it \"ab-test-launcher\". Inside its directory, there are two files: icon.png is an image that represents the application nr1.json is the launcher's metadata file Use \"A/B Test Launcher\" for the launcher's displayName and \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\" for the description in nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"ab-test-launcher\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test Launcher\", \"description\": \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\" } launchers/ab-test-launcher/nr1.json Copy Notice that the launcher has a rootNerdletId. This identifies the Nerdlet that the launcher opens when it's selected. This Nerdpack has only one Nerdlet, called ab-test-nerdlet, but some Nerdpacks may have multiple. Make sure that you set the rootNerdletId to the Nerdlet you want the launcher to open. Nerdlets The nerdlets directory contains all the Nerdlets that make up your New Relic One application. Since ab-test-nerdlet is the only Nerdlet in this Nerdpack, there is only one subdirectory. In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, there are three files: index.js is the JavaScript file that contains your Nerdlet component styles.scss holds the Sass stylesheet for your Nerdlet nr1.json contains the Nerdlet's metadata Update your Nerdlet's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and description to \"Control and view results of your A/B test\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"Control and view results of your A/B test\" } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Now, you've customized your Nerdpack, Nerdlet, and launcher with informative display names and descriptions, but what does your application actually do? Check out index.js to see what your default Nerdlet looks like: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, ab-test-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you have AbTestNerdletNerdlet, which nr1 created for you. It's a React component that renders a first-level welcome heading. Because this is the root Nerdlet, as specified in your launcher's nr1.json file, when you click on your launcher in the New Relic platform, the launcher will open a view that displays this heading. Tip In this lesson, you used nr1 create to create a Nerdpack, complete with a launcher and a Nerdlet. If you want to create another Nerdlet or Launcher in your Nerdpack, you can also do that with nr1 create: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdlet $ nr1 create --type launcher You can even skip the --type flag and select an option from a list: bash Copy $ nr1 create ? What kind of component do you want to create? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit. nerdpack ❯ nerdlet - create a/an Nerdlet Nerdpack item inside your Nerdpack. launcher catalog visualization In the next lesson, you'll learn how to serve your Nerdpack locally and see your app in action!

      "body": "This list is current. Last updated September 28, 2021. This is a list of the networks, IP addresses, domains, ports, and endpoints used by API clients or agents to communicate with New Relic. TLS is required for all domains. Your browser must be able to communicate with a number of domains for New Relic One to work properly. See User-facing domains for the list of domains that should be allowed through your firewall. For information on our FedRAMP endpoints see our FedRAMP endpoints documentation. TLS encryption To ensure data security for our customers and to be in compliance with FedRAMP and other standards for data encryption, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is required for all domains. Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. For more information, see New Relic's Explorers Hub post about TLS 1.2. In addition, TLS 1.2 is required for most domains, except: APM agent connections Browser agent connections Event API For future updates to required and supported protocol versions, follow the Security Notifications tag in New Relic's Explorers Hub. User-facing domains Update your allow list to ensure New Relic can communicate with a number of integral domains (listed below). Blocking domains can cause issues with individual product features or prevent pages from loading altogether. This list doesn't cover domains that New Relic connects to that can be blocked without affecting your usage of the product. It also doesn't cover Nerdpacks or other features that communicate with external services that have additional domain requirements. If your organization uses a firewall that restricts outbound traffic, ensure that the following domains are added to the allow list: Domain Description *.newrelic.com New Relic One and supporting services *.nr-assets.net Static New Relic assets *.nr-ext.net New Relic One Nerdpacks and assets *.amazonaws.com New Relic One catalog assets behind AWS S3 *.cloudfront.net Static New Relic assets behind AWS CloudFront CDN secure.gravatar.com Support for Gravatar avatars fonts.googleapis.com Support for Google Fonts fonts.gstatic.com Support for Google Fonts www.google.com Support for reCAPTCHA www.gstatic.com Support for reCAPTCHA *.nr-data.net OpenTelemetry and Pixie APM agents To enhance network performance and data security, New Relic uses a CDN and DDoS prevention service with a large IP range. New Relic agents require your firewall to allow outgoing connections to the following networks and ports. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections APM data Networks US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Ports US region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 EU region accounts: Default: TCP 443 (recommended) TCP 80 Endpoints US region accounts: collector*.newrelic.com EU region accounts: collector*.eu01.nr-data.net:443 (recommended) Recommendation: Use port 443, a secured channel for encrypted HTTPS traffic. Some New Relic agents also offer port 80, an unsecured channel open to all HTTP traffic. While some agents can be configured to use both port 80 and port 443, we recommend that you choose the port 443 (default). If you have an existing configuration that uses port 80, you can update it to use port 443, the default New Relic connection. Agent downloads TLS is required for all domains. Service for download.newrelic.com is provided through Fastly and is subject to change without warning. For the most current list of public IP addresses for New Relic agent downloads, see api.fastly.com/public-ip-list. Infrastructure agents In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure monitoring needs outbound access to these domains, networks, and ports. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Infrastructure data Domains infra-api.newrelic.com identity-api.newrelic.com infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com log-api.newrelic.com log-api.eu.newrelic.com metric-api.newrelic.com Networks For US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 For EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22 Port 443 Domains + Port For US region accounts: infra-api.newrelic.com:443 identity-api.newrelic.com:443 infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com:443 log-api.newrelic.com:443 metric-api.newrelic.com:443 For EU region accounts: infra-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 identity-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 infrastructure-command-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 log-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 metric-api.eu.newrelic.com:443 Proxy If your system needs a proxy to connect to this domain, use the Infrastructure proxy setting. Browser domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our browser agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: bam.nr-data.net js-agent.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: eu01.nr-data.net bam.eu01.nr-data.net For more information about CDN access for the js-agent.newrelic.com file to the domain bam.nr-data.net or to one of the New Relic beacons, see Security for browser monitoring. Mobile domains In addition to the IP addresses for APM agents, applications monitored by our mobile agents use outgoing connections to the following domains. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: For US region accounts: mobile-collector.newrelic.com mobile-crash.newrelic.com mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com For EU region accounts: mobile-collector.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-crash.eu01.nr-data.net mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net Synthetic monitor public locations To configure your firewall to allow synthetic monitors to access your monitored URL, use Synthetic public minion IPs. TLS is required for all domains. Synthetic monitor private locations Synthetic private minions report to a specific endpoint based on region. Configure your firewall to allow the private minion to access the endpoint or the static IP addresses associated with the endpoint. These IP addresses may change in the future. TLS is required for all domains. Use the IP connections for account data in the US or European Union region as appropriate: IP connections Synthetics private location data Endpoint For US region accounts: https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/ For EU region accounts: https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/ IP addresses For US region accounts: 13.248.153.51 76.223.21.185 For EU region accounts: 185.221.86.57 185.221.86.25 Alerts webhooks, api.newrelic.com, cloud integrations, and ticketing integrations Endpoints that use api.newrelic.com (such as our GraphQL API for NerdGraph) and our New Relic-generated webhooks for alert policies use an IP address from designated network blocks for the US or European Union region. TLS is required for all addresses in these blocks. Network blocks for US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 Network blocks for EU region accounts: 158.177.65.64/29 159.122.103.184/29 161.156.125.32/28 These network blocks also apply to third-party ticketing integrations and New Relic cloud integrations. Pixie integration The Pixie integration runs in your Kubernetes cluster and pulls a set of curated observability data from Pixie to send it to New Relic using the OpenTelemetry line protocol. The Pixie integration requires outbound network access to the following: work.withpixie.ai:443 otlp.nr-data.net:4317 (US region accounts) otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 (EU region accounts) OpenTelemetry New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. To export OTLP data to New Relic, configure the OTLP exporter to add a header ( api-key ) whose value is your account license key. And, based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. See the OpenTelemetry quick start for more information. otlp.nr-data.net:4317 (US region accounts) otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 (EU region accounts) Network blocks for US region accounts: 162.247.240.0/22 Network blocks for EU region accounts: 185.221.84.0/22",

      "body": "This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model. Requirements Some notes on requirements: This tutorial is for users on our New Relic One user model. Creating access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we recommend you check out: Understand what an access grant is Videos that show the user management UI in action This tutorial will walk you through how to: Add users View available accounts Grant groups access to roles and accounts Create custom roles Add users to groups Add users Adding users to New Relic is a separate process from creating access grants. In other words, you can do either procedure first. The key point is that if you're trying to give a user access to a role or an account that they don't yet have, they won't have that access until they're both a) in a group and b) that group has the correct access grant (access to a specific role on a specific account). There are two ways to add users: With the user management UI (described below) With automated user management, also known as SCIM provisioning: use of this method means that groups are defined in your identity provider and so you can't edit a user's group from the New Relic UI. To add users from the UI: From the top right of the New Relic UI, click the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Relevant tips: For how to bulk edit users' user type, see Edit user type. When choosing a group, you can choose either one of our default groups or a custom group that you've defined an access grant for. For more on creating access grants, keep reading. View available accounts When thinking about creating access grants for granting access to different accounts, it can help you to understand what accounts there are in your organization. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant access to accounts and roles Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic: by creating an access grant, you assign a group access to a) a specific role on b) a specific account. By default, organizations on the New Relic One user model have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. To view existing access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. Even if you haven't created any custom access grants, you will see the default-created grants there that are present for our default groups. This is what you might see when you go to the Organization and access UI and view groups. The default available groups of Admin and User have access grants automatically created that grant users in those groups access to the roles associated with those groups and to the initial account those users were added in. To create a new access grant that gives a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're logged in with an original user model record, or because you don't have the ability to manage users. For more on such factors, see Factors affecting access. Choose one of the following: Existing: If there is already a group you want to add an access grant to, you can use this. For example, if you want to gives users in the default Admin or User group access to new accounts, you might choose this and then select the Admin Default or Admin User role. New: If you need to create a new group, choose this. You'll also need to choose the authentication domain that group is inside of (for an explanation of what \"Default\" means, see Default groups. If your organization strategy requires a good amount of restrictions over access to accounts and access to roles, you'll probably need to create a good amount of access grants. Next, under Access grant, you'll choose one of following: Account: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are account-scoped. These are the roles that have to do with using and configuring our platform features (and not about organization and user management). Organization: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are organization-scoped. These are the roles that govern organization- and user management. (Note that these users must also already belong to an account-scoped role. This is true for most users but if it's not, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Select the Role you want to assign. Roles are organization-wide, so regardless of the authentication domain you're in, you have access to our standard roles and any custom roles you've created. For tips on selecting roles, see the tips after these instructions. Select the Account you want to add access to from the dropdown. If you don't see an account that you'd expect to see, this may be for a few reasons. One is that you yourself don't have the proper permissions for that account. Another is that that account is not actually in your organization. For more information, see Factors affecting access. If you are still having problems, talk to your account representative. If you want to continue adding more grants for that same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. When you're done, if your users are already in the group you've added the grant to, they should have access within a few minutes (although for EU region New Relic accounts, this can take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true if you just created an access grant with a new group), you'll need to go to the User management UI and add that group to those users. Some tips for using this UI: Note that if a user has the organization-scoped Organization manager and/or Authentication domain manager roles, which is true of users in the default Admin group, those users will always have those capabilities because those are organization-scoped abilities. This means that when you go to add those users to another account, you only have to add an account-scoped role, and not an organization-scoped role. In other words, once the users in a group have those organization-scoped roles, they will always have them in that organization unless removed. When selecting from amongst our standard roles, it's important to understand the difference between All product admin and Standard user. In short, All product admin is more popular a choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure them, you'd choose Standard user. If your users are managed via automated user management, there are some restrictions that may apply. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the User management UI to add users to groups, because groups are managed and imported from your identity provider. If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. Create custom role When creating an access grant, you can use our standard roles, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Review the list of available capabilities and decide which ones your custom role needs. For more information about how roles and capabilities work, see Capabilities. Once you're finished creating a custom role, you will probably want to use it in a new access grant. Add users to groups In the user management UI, you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to. Your users only have access to the access grants associated with the groups they've been added to. To view users and see their groups: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add chart headings, before starting this one. With your charts organized and descriptive headings above each one, your New Relic One application is becoming more usable. In this lesson, you'll continue that trend by creating descriptions for each design version in your A/B test. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-version-descriptions/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-version-descriptions/ab-test Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named description.js: bash Copy $ touch description.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a new React component, called VersionDescription, which uses a HeadingText and a BlockText to render a version description that you pass, using the description prop: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, HeadingText } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionDescription extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return ( <div> <HeadingText className=\"versionHeader\"> Version {this.props.version} </HeadingText> <BlockText className=\"versionText\"> {this.props.description} </BlockText> </div> ) } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/description.js Copy You'll use this one class to create a version description for each design version in your A/B test. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import VersionDescription, create descriptions for each design version, and create a new GridItem component for each design version: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you've created two VersionDescription components. You passed the description and version props, which correspond to a design version. You also added a horizontal rule to visually separate the descriptions from the charts in your app. For this, you added a GridItem with a columnSpan of 12, to stretch the rule the full width of the grid. Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-version-descriptions/ab-test.

In the previous lesson, you created a section of your application that allows you to pick the most effective design from your A/B test.

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Step 4. Assign users and groups Next, you'll assign users in Okta's New Relic application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. Assignments tab In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Highly recommended: Set your users' time zones in Okta. The time zone affects how date/times for that user are shown in New Relic. Users without a time zone configured will be shown in UTC time in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). There are several ways in Okta to assign users' time zone, so consult the Okta docs for more information if needed. Here is one way to do this in the Assignments tab: In the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Manage user type If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, the count of your full users is a billing factor. To change some of your users to free basic users, you have two choices: Manage user type from New Relic using the User management UI, OR Manage user type from Okta (described below). To manage your users' user type from Okta: Go to the New Relic authentication domain UI and click Enable Manage user type with SCIM. Note that when this is enabled, you can’t manage user type from the New Relic UI and can only manage it from Okta. Go into your Okta instance. The rest of these instructions are done from Okta. Next, you'll configure Okta to be able to send a new attribute nrUserType. Steps: Go to the Profile editor. In the Attributes section, click Add attribute. Set your settings to match the screenshot below (except for the variable name, which is created automatically). The only two fields that must match exactly are External name and External namespace. The value for External namespace must be urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User Next, you'll configure your Okta user profile to have this field. Steps: In the Profile editor, go to Users and click the User (default) profile. Add a new New Relic user type attribute to that profile (see Okta user profile instructions). How you set this will depend on your own setup and preferences for defining user type. Note that the expected values for user type are Basic user and Full user. Below is an example with information filled in. In the People section, define the user type for your users. How you do this will depend on your setup and preferences. For example, you may choose to set this manually by setting each user’s user type, or you may use Okta to manage these in bulk. Next, you’ll set up mapping for that attribute. Steps: In the app's Provisioning section, click Unmapped attributes. Go into edit mode for the unmapped New Relic user type attribute. Configure it based on how you want to set the user type. To learn about why you'd set them as basic users or full users, see User type. Learn more about Okta attribute mappings. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you're able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

Forwarding your Fluent Bit logs to New Relic will give you enhanced log management capabilities to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data. Basic process We have published a container with the plugin installed. It serves as a base image to be used by our Kubernetes integration. We recommend you use this base image and layer your own custom configuration files. To forward your logs from Fluent Bit to New Relic: Make sure you have: A New Relic license key Fluent Bit 1.0 or higher (recommended), although v0.12 or higher is supported Install the Fluent Bit plugin. Configure the Fluent Bit plugin. Test the Fluent Bit plugin. Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then check your account for data. Install the Fluent Bit plugin To install the Fluent Bit plugin: Navigate to New Relic's Fluent Bit plugin repository on GitHub. From the repository page, clone or download the repository. Run the following command to build your plugin: cd newrelic-fluent-bit-output && make all Copy Store out_newrelic.so or out_newrelic_winXX.dll at a location that can be accessed by the fluent-bit daemon. Tip If you'd rather not compile the plugin yourself, you can download pre-compiled versions from our GitHub repository's releases page. Configure the Fluent Bit plugin Fluent Bit needs to know the location of the New Relic plugin and the New Relic license key to output data to New Relic. To configure your Fluent Bit plugin: Important Pay attention to white space when editing your config files. Be sure to use four spaces to indent and one space between keys and values. Locate or create a plugins.conf file in your plugins directory. In the plugins.conf file, add a reference to out_newrelic.so, adjacent to your fluent-bit.conf file: [PLUGINS] Path /PATH/TO/newrelic-fluent-bit-output/out_newrelic.so Copy In the fluent-bit.conf file, add the following line under the service block: [SERVICE] # This is the main configuration block for fluent bit. # Ensure the follow line exists somewhere in the SERVICE block Plugins_File plugins.conf Copy At the bottom of the fluent-bit.conf file, add the following to set up the input and output filters. Replace the placeholder text with your New Relic license key: [INPUT] Name tail Path /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE [OUTPUT] Name newrelic Match * licenseKey YOUR_LICENSE_KEY # Optional maxBufferSize 256000 maxRecords 1024 Copy Restart your Fluent Bit instance with the following command: fluent-bit -c /PATH/TO/fluent-bit.conf Copy Test the Fluent Bit plugin To test if your Fluent Bit plugin is receiving input from a log file: Run the following command to append a test log message to your log file: echo \"test message\" >> /PATH/TO/YOUR/LOG/FILE Copy Search the New Relic Logs UI for test message. Associate logs with entities To associate a log line with an entity, such as an infrastructure host, add a FILTER block: [FILTER] Name modify Match * # Or specify a match Add entity.guids <Your Entity GUID ID> # Optional Add hostname <Your hostname> # Optional Copy For more options, see the Fluent Bit modify filter documentation and our documentation to forward your logs using the infrastructure agent. Optional: Configure plugin attributes Once you have installed and configured the Fluent Bit plugin, you can use the following attributes to configure how the plugin sends data to New Relic: Key Description licenseKey The New Relic license key. Use either licenseKey (recommended) or apiKey, not both. Default: none maxBufferSize The maximum size the payloads sent, in bytes. Default: 256000 maxRecords The maximum number of records to send at a time. Default: 1024 apiKey Deprecated. Takes a New Relic Insights insert key, but using the licenseKey attribute is preferred. Use either licenseKey or apiKey, not both.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add your first chart, before starting this one. You’ve begun building your A/B test application. So far, it consists of a single line chart, which represents the number of subscriptions your newsletter receives from each version of your website. To understand what you’ll build in this lesson, review the design guide to remember what charts come next: In the design, there are two pie charts beneath the line chart that you’ve already created. One represents the distribution of users who receive version A and version B. The other represents the distribution of successful requests from users who got version A and version B. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-pie-charts/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add two new Javascript files: total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js bash Copy $ touch total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js Step 3 of 9 In total-subscriptions.js, create a component, called TotalSubscriptions, which renders mocked subscription data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Notice that the series data is formatted differently for PieChart than it was for LineChart. Because PieChart uses unidimensional data, its series only take y-values. Step 4 of 9 In total-cancellations.js, create a component, called TotalCancellations, which renders mocked cancellation data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new components and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test.

This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the PieChart components displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Your application is starting to take shape. You’ve created a line chart and two pie charts. For now, these charts use mocked data, but you’ll provide them real data in a later lesson. Before you focus on the data in your charts, however, you’ll learn how to add a table to your application so you can visualize data in a new way.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add tables, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you added a variety of charts to your A/B test application. These charts presented different facets of information about your A/B test, and they behaved independently from one other. In this lesson, you’ll create a new pair of line charts and learn how to synchronize their behaviors. Before you write any new code, consult your design guide to understand the role that these new charts will play in your application: In the design guide, there is a line graph under each of the tables you created in the last lesson. These line graphs show the version-specific response times for newsletter signup requests. Now, you’ll build two more line charts, but this time, you’ll group them with a ChartGroup and specify that their values are measured in milliseconds. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-a-chart-group/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named page-views.js: bash Copy $ touch page-views.js Step 3 of 9 In this new file, create a component called VersionPageViews to hold a LineChart, which shows the number of times a page is viewed: import React from 'react'; import { LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Notice the new attribute in the series' metadata fields: units_data. This attribute describes the unit type for a specified data axis. In this case, you set the unit type for the y axis to 'MS', which stands for milliseconds. Other options for unit types, include: 'PERCENTAGE', 'TIMESTAMP', and 'BYTES_PER_SECOND'. Step 4 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In index.js, import ChartGroup from nr1 and group your VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <ChartGroup> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </ChartGroup> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Because the tables are conceptually related, as they show contrasting performance metrics over the same timeslice, it makes sense to group them in a ChartGroup. This means that the two charts behave synchronously. For example, when you hover over one chart, the other chart shows a hover indicator at the same x coordinate. Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the LineChart components synchronized in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Tip Each of the chart component types you've used in this lesson have had different series configurations. Most chart components share the same metadata attributes, like LineChart and PieChart, but differ in their data formats. It's helpful to be aware of the different data formats, for when you create your own charts. You can read more about the data formats in the chart component documentation. Now your application is filled with charts, but it doesn't look great. The charts are stacked on top of one another in an unhelpful way. In the next lesson, you'll learn about the user interface components from the SDK and how you can use them to organize your charts. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account and Node.js installed on your machine. See Setting up your development environment for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git $ cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application. Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID $ npm install # Install dependencies $ nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, you should see a Create a table launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet subdirectory and open the index.js file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component. Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows. As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells. The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done! Keep exploring the Table components, their properties, and how to use them, in our SDK documentation.",

      "body": "NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: bash Copy $ cd /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage Update the UUID and serve the application: bash Copy $ nr1 update $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User. For more information on the various NerdStorage components, please visit the New Relic developer website API documentation.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add navigation to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you finished the A/B test application you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to prepare it for publication. When you publish your app to the New Relic One catalog, users can view it and subscribe to it. You can help your users by showing and telling them what the app does, how to use it, and more. Create catalog information To supply information to the catalog about your app, you need to create the catalog directory in your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 6 Change to the describe-app/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test Step 2 of 6 Create the catalog directories: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog This creates a root catalog directory with template files for inputting custom information about your app and a catalog directory for each Nerdpack item where screenshots can be stored. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog directory. Step 3 of 6 Update catalog/documentation.md: ## Documentation This application combines and presents data from New Relic and the Nerdsletter API so that we can make an informed decision on which design version results in more high-quality newsletter subscriptions. It also presents an button to end the test, which saves the date and version descriptions in local storage. We can use this app for future A/B tests as well! catalog/documentation.md Copy For this course, you're keeping the documentation concise by merely describing what the app does. In your own projects, you might also include instructions for contributing to the project in an open source context, installing the app's dependencies, or anything else that might help a user navigate complexities in your app or code. Step 4 of 6 Update catalog/config.json: { \"tagline\": \"Win @ newsletter subscriptions\", \"details\": \"Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course\", \"whatsNew\": \"Initial release! Includes:\\n- A variety of charts for understanding the test results\\n- An end test button for storing some test data in a table\", \"support\": { \"email\": { \"address\": \"\" }, \"issues\": { \"url\": \"\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"\" } } } catalog/config.json Copy Here, you've specified a tagline, project details, the source code repository, and a short list of everything included in the initial release. In other projects, you might also add a support email or support links. Step 5 of 6 Save the this screenshot to your catalog/screenshots directory. Users will be able to see a carousel of screenshots in your app's About page in the catalog. Step 6 of 6 Save the following icon as icon.png in two places: nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test/launchers/ab-test-launcher This will act as the launcher's icon and the app's catalog icon on the About page. Now you've added documentation, screenshots, metadata, and an icon to your app so that users will be able to understand what it does and why they might need it. For now, these files are all local and they need to be submitted to the catalog. But before you can do that, your app, itself, needs to be published to the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll publish your app, submit your catalog information, and view the results in New Relic.

      "body": "This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model. Requirements Some notes on requirements: This tutorial is for users on our New Relic One user model. Creating access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we recommend you check out: Understand what an access grant is Videos that show the user management UI in action This tutorial will walk you through how to: Add users View available accounts Grant groups access to roles and accounts Create custom roles Add users to groups Add users Adding users to New Relic is a separate process from creating access grants. In other words, you can do either procedure first. The key point is that if you're trying to give a user access to a role or an account that they don't yet have, they won't have that access until they're both a) in a group and b) that group has the correct access grant (access to a specific role on a specific account). There are two ways to add users: With the user management UI (described below) With automated user management, also known as SCIM provisioning: use of this method means that groups are defined in your identity provider and so you can't edit a user's group from the New Relic UI. To add users from the UI: From the top right of the New Relic UI, click the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Relevant tips: For how to bulk edit users' user type, see Edit user type. When choosing a group, you can choose either one of our default groups or a custom group that you've defined an access grant for. For more on creating access grants, keep reading. View available accounts When thinking about creating access grants for granting access to different accounts, it can help you to understand what accounts there are in your organization. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant access to accounts and roles Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic: by creating an access grant, you assign a group access to a) a specific role on b) a specific account. By default, organizations on the New Relic One user model have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. To view existing access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. Even if you haven't created any custom access grants, you will see the default-created grants there that are present for our default groups. This is what you might see when you go to the Organization and access UI and view groups. The default available groups of Admin and User have access grants automatically created that grant users in those groups access to the roles associated with those groups and to the initial account those users were added in. To create a new access grant that gives a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're logged in with an original user model record, or because you don't have the ability to manage users. For more on such factors, see Factors affecting access. Choose one of the following: Existing: If there is already a group you want to add an access grant to, you can use this. For example, if you want to gives users in the default Admin or User group access to new accounts, you might choose this and then select the Admin Default or Admin User role. New: If you need to create a new group, choose this. You'll also need to choose the authentication domain that group is inside of (for an explanation of what \"Default\" means, see Default groups. If your organization strategy requires a good amount of restrictions over access to accounts and access to roles, you'll probably need to create a good amount of access grants. Next, under Access grant, you'll choose one of following: Account: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are account-scoped. These are the roles that have to do with using and configuring our platform features (and not about organization and user management). Organization: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are organization-scoped. These are the roles that govern organization- and user management. (Note that these users must also already belong to an account-scoped role. This is true for most users but if it's not, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Select the Role you want to assign. Roles are organization-wide, so regardless of the authentication domain you're in, you have access to our standard roles and any custom roles you've created. For tips on selecting roles, see the tips after these instructions. Select the Account you want to add access to from the dropdown. If you don't see an account that you'd expect to see, this may be for a few reasons. One is that you yourself don't have the proper permissions for that account. Another is that that account is not actually in your organization. For more information, see Factors affecting access. If you are still having problems, talk to your account representative. If you want to continue adding more grants for that same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. When you're done, if your users are already in the group you've added the grant to, they should have access within a few minutes (although for EU region New Relic accounts, this can take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true if you just created an access grant with a new group), you'll need to go to the User management UI and add that group to those users. Some tips for using this UI: Note that if a user has the organization-scoped Organization manager and/or Authentication domain manager roles, which is true of users in the default Admin group, those users will always have those capabilities because those are organization-scoped abilities. This means that when you go to add those users to another account, you only have to add an account-scoped role, and not an organization-scoped role. In other words, once the users in a group have those organization-scoped roles, they will always have them in that organization unless removed. When selecting from amongst our standard roles, it's important to understand the difference between All product admin and Standard user. In short, All product admin is more popular a choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure them, you'd choose Standard user. If your users are managed via automated user management, there are some restrictions that may apply. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the User management UI to add users to groups, because groups are managed and imported from your identity provider. If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. Create custom role When creating an access grant, you can use our standard roles, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Review the list of available capabilities and decide which ones your custom role needs. For more information about how roles and capabilities work, see Capabilities. Once you're finished creating a custom role, you will probably want to use it in a new access grant. Add users to groups In the user management UI, you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to. Your users only have access to the access grants associated with the groups they've been added to. To view users and see their groups: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now.

For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now.

This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events.

For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic user versus full user) Note that there are limits around how many times full users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the Instant Observability catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info AbTest (Nerdpack): description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

AbTestNerdlet (Nerdlet): displayName: AbTestNerdlet supportedEntityTypes.mode: NONE All the information from catalog shows here. Step 3 of 3 View your app in Instant Observability: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Subscribe to your New Relic One application.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add PlatformStateContext to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you used PlatformStateContext from the New Relic One SDK to look up the time range that the user selected from the app's time picker. Now, you'll learn about another component that interacts with the New Relic platform: navigation. The navigation component lets you open entities, navigate to entities, and build Location objects for entities from your Nerdlet. You can also use navigation for other Nerdlets and launchers. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-navigation/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In newsletter-signups.js, create a new method, called NewsletterSignups.openApmEntity(): import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. This method uses navigation.openStackedEntity() to display your demo application's APM entity in a stacked view. Notice openApmEntity() requires your ENTITY_GUID. You need to locate that ID and store it in a constant. Step 3 of 10 Navigate to APM: See metadata for your Newsletter service: Copy the entity's GUID: Create an ENTITY_GUID constant: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and the entity GUID you just copied, respectively. Now, openApmEntity() knows what entity to show. Next, you need to create a button to invoke this method. Step 4 of 10 Create a button to show your APM entity: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you've created a button and configured it to call openApmEntity() when it's clicked. Step 5 of 10 Import Stack and StackItem: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. You'll use Stack and StackItem to lay out the button on the far right side of the same row that the HeadingText is on. Step 6 of 10 Lay out the Stack: import React from 'react'; import { Button, HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, Stack, StackItem, navigation, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> const ENTITY_GUID = \"<YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID>\" export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { openAPMEntity() { navigation.openStackedEntity(ENTITY_GUID) } render() { return <div> <Stack fullWidth> <StackItem grow={true}> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> </StackItem> <StackItem> <Button onClick={this.openAPMEntity}> App performance </Button> </StackItem> </Stack> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Here, you used a full-width Stack to set up the layout for the row. To make the HeadingText fill the entire row except the width of the button, you used the StackItem.grow prop. Step 7 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-navigation/ab-test. Step 8 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 9 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 10 of 10 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps. Click App performance: Now you see the stacked entity: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively Congratulations! You're finished writing all the code you'll write for your New Relic One A/B test application. Now, you have an application reporting New Relic data from your demo service that is running an A/B test. You've created several charts, buttons, and other UI elements. And you've organized your components into a readable and usable view. On top of the visuals, you've supplied data to your charts from multiple data sources in and outside of New Relic. You've created some backend functionality which utilizes your New Relic One application's own data store. You've also utilized the platform APIs for interacting with platform UI and showing a stacked entity view. You've really accomplished a lot throughout this course, so far. There are only a few things left to do! First, is to learn how to publish and subscribe to your New Relic One application so that it can run on our platform instead of your own local server. Second, is to learn how to deal with some common issues you might see in New Relic One application development. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Describe your app for the catalog.",

      "body": "This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model. Requirements Some notes on requirements: This tutorial is for users on our New Relic One user model. Creating access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we recommend you check out: Understand what an access grant is Videos that show the user management UI in action This tutorial will walk you through how to: Add users View available accounts Grant groups access to roles and accounts Create custom roles Add users to groups Add users Adding users to New Relic is a separate process from creating access grants. In other words, you can do either procedure first. The key point is that if you're trying to give a user access to a role or an account that they don't yet have, they won't have that access until they're both a) in a group and b) that group has the correct access grant (access to a specific role on a specific account). There are two ways to add users: With the user management UI (described below) With automated user management, also known as SCIM provisioning: use of this method means that groups are defined in your identity provider and so you can't edit a user's group from the New Relic UI. To add users from the UI: From the top right of the New Relic UI, click the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Relevant tips: For how to bulk edit users' user type, see Edit user type. When choosing a group, you can choose either one of our default groups or a custom group that you've defined an access grant for. For more on creating access grants, keep reading. View available accounts When thinking about creating access grants for granting access to different accounts, it can help you to understand what accounts there are in your organization. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant access to accounts and roles Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic: by creating an access grant, you assign a group access to a) a specific role on b) a specific account. By default, organizations on the New Relic One user model have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. To view existing access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. Even if you haven't created any custom access grants, you will see the default-created grants there that are present for our default groups. This is what you might see when you go to the Organization and access UI and view groups. The default available groups of Admin and User have access grants automatically created that grant users in those groups access to the roles associated with those groups and to the initial account those users were added in. To create a new access grant that gives a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're logged in with an original user model record, or because you don't have the ability to manage users. For more on such factors, see Factors affecting access. Choose one of the following: Existing: If there is already a group you want to add an access grant to, you can use this. For example, if you want to gives users in the default Admin or User group access to new accounts, you might choose this and then select the Admin Default or Admin User role. New: If you need to create a new group, choose this. You'll also need to choose the authentication domain that group is inside of (for an explanation of what \"Default\" means, see Default groups. If your organization strategy requires a good amount of restrictions over access to accounts and access to roles, you'll probably need to create a good amount of access grants. Next, under Access grant, you'll choose one of following: Account: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are account-scoped. These are the roles that have to do with using and configuring our platform features (and not about organization and user management). Organization: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are organization-scoped. These are the roles that govern organization- and user management. (Note that these users must also already belong to an account-scoped role. This is true for most users but if it's not, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Select the Role you want to assign. Roles are organization-wide, so regardless of the authentication domain you're in, you have access to our standard roles and any custom roles you've created. For tips on selecting roles, see the tips after these instructions. Select the Account you want to add access to from the dropdown. If you don't see an account that you'd expect to see, this may be for a few reasons. One is that you yourself don't have the proper permissions for that account. Another is that that account is not actually in your organization. For more information, see Factors affecting access. If you are still having problems, talk to your account representative. If you want to continue adding more grants for that same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. When you're done, if your users are already in the group you've added the grant to, they should have access within a few minutes (although for EU region New Relic accounts, this can take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true if you just created an access grant with a new group), you'll need to go to the User management UI and add that group to those users. Some tips for using this UI: Note that if a user has the organization-scoped Organization manager and/or Authentication domain manager roles, which is true of users in the default Admin group, those users will always have those capabilities because those are organization-scoped abilities. This means that when you go to add those users to another account, you only have to add an account-scoped role, and not an organization-scoped role. In other words, once the users in a group have those organization-scoped roles, they will always have them in that organization unless removed. When selecting from amongst our standard roles, it's important to understand the difference between All product admin and Standard user. In short, All product admin is more popular a choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure them, you'd choose Standard user. If your users are managed via automated user management, there are some restrictions that may apply. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the User management UI to add users to groups, because groups are managed and imported from your identity provider. If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. Create custom role When creating an access grant, you can use our standard roles, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Review the list of available capabilities and decide which ones your custom role needs. For more information about how roles and capabilities work, see Capabilities. Once you're finished creating a custom role, you will probably want to use it in a new access grant. Add users to groups In the user management UI, you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to. Your users only have access to the access grants associated with the groups they've been added to. To view users and see their groups: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic user versus full user) Note that there are limits around how many times full users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

The New Relic One application that you're building throughout this course allows developers to A/B test their websites. To run a successful A/B test, site owners need to be able to analyze the results. Without knowing how each design performs, how will developers determine which design to use? Here is a mockup for the A/B test application you're building: Your application displays data for two competing versions. With various charts and tables, your users will be able to analyze the results of their test and make informed decisions on which design will work best to achieve their goals. You’ll refer back to this mockup many times throughout this course. It shows you what charts to create, how to organize them, and what kind of data to provide them. In the next four sections, you learn how to create every chart that your A/B test application needs to operate effectively. After that, you’ll arrange the charts to match the mockup’s design and supply New Relic data collected from the demo applications you spun up earlier.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Install and configure the New Relic One CLI, before starting this one. A Nerdpack is a package that contains all the files that make up a New Relic One application or visualization. Nerdpacks include files for metadata, Nerdlets, assets, and more. To create a Nerdpack, use the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack When nr1 prompts for a component name, use \"ab-test\" and watch the tool create the foundations of your Nerdpack. Once it's finished, explore the files it created for you. Root directory At the root level, you have a directory called ab-test. Everything inside this directory is part of the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls ab-test README.md nerdlets nr1.json package.json launchers node_modules package-lock.json Readme.md provides instructions for creating Nerdpack elements and serving your application locally. This and nr1 --help are useful if you forget how to interact with your Nerdpack using the command line tool. Javascript files package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules are important for running your JavaScript application, but aren't unique to Nerdpacks. You can learn about these modules from JavaScript courses should you need to tweak them. For now, take a look at nr1.json, one of the most relevant files in this directory. Metadata file nr1.json is the Nerdpack's metadata file, containing a schema type, unique identifier, a display name, and a description. Since you’re building a New Relic One application for running and analyzing A/B tests, update the package's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and set the description to \"A/B test your application using New Relic One\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"311bcd0c-f7eb-4285-afed-4219179bf91d\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"A/B test your application using New Relic One.\" } nr1.json Copy It's good to describe your application's purpose, especially if you're going to publish your application for others to use. Next, look at the launchers and nerdlets subdirectories. Launchers launchers is a directory because you can create multiple launchers for your New Relic One application. nr1 create only created one launcher for your Nerdpack and called it \"ab-test-launcher\". Inside its directory, there are two files: icon.png is an image that represents the application nr1.json is the launcher's metadata file Use \"A/B Test Launcher\" for the launcher's displayName and \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\" for the description in nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"ab-test-launcher\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test Launcher\", \"description\": \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\" } launchers/ab-test-launcher/nr1.json Copy Notice that the launcher has a rootNerdletId. This identifies the Nerdlet that the launcher opens when it's selected. This Nerdpack has only one Nerdlet, called ab-test-nerdlet, but some Nerdpacks may have multiple. Make sure that you set the rootNerdletId to the Nerdlet you want the launcher to open. Nerdlets The nerdlets directory contains all the Nerdlets that make up your New Relic One application. Since ab-test-nerdlet is the only Nerdlet in this Nerdpack, there is only one subdirectory. In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, there are three files: index.js is the JavaScript file that contains your Nerdlet component styles.scss holds the Sass stylesheet for your Nerdlet nr1.json contains the Nerdlet's metadata Update your Nerdlet's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and description to \"Control and view results of your A/B test\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"Control and view results of your A/B test\" } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Now, you've customized your Nerdpack, Nerdlet, and launcher with informative display names and descriptions, but what does your application actually do? Check out index.js to see what your default Nerdlet looks like: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, ab-test-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you have AbTestNerdletNerdlet, which nr1 created for you. It's a React component that renders a first-level welcome heading. Because this is the root Nerdlet, as specified in your launcher's nr1.json file, when you click on your launcher in the New Relic platform, the launcher will open a view that displays this heading. Tip In this lesson, you used nr1 create to create a Nerdpack, complete with a launcher and a Nerdlet. If you want to create another Nerdlet or Launcher in your Nerdpack, you can also do that with nr1 create: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdlet $ nr1 create --type launcher You can even skip the --type flag and select an option from a list: bash Copy $ nr1 create ?

      "body": "This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model. Requirements Some notes on requirements: This tutorial is for users on our New Relic One user model. Creating access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we recommend you check out: Understand what an access grant is Videos that show the user management UI in action This tutorial will walk you through how to: Add users View available accounts Grant groups access to roles and accounts Create custom roles Add users to groups Add users Adding users to New Relic is a separate process from creating access grants. In other words, you can do either procedure first. The key point is that if you're trying to give a user access to a role or an account that they don't yet have, they won't have that access until they're both a) in a group and b) that group has the correct access grant (access to a specific role on a specific account). There are two ways to add users: With the user management UI (described below) With automated user management, also known as SCIM provisioning: use of this method means that groups are defined in your identity provider and so you can't edit a user's group from the New Relic UI. To add users from the UI: From the top right of the New Relic UI, click the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Relevant tips: For how to bulk edit users' user type, see Edit user type. When choosing a group, you can choose either one of our default groups or a custom group that you've defined an access grant for. For more on creating access grants, keep reading. View available accounts When thinking about creating access grants for granting access to different accounts, it can help you to understand what accounts there are in your organization. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant access to accounts and roles Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic: by creating an access grant, you assign a group access to a) a specific role on b) a specific account. By default, organizations on the New Relic One user model have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. To view existing access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. Even if you haven't created any custom access grants, you will see the default-created grants there that are present for our default groups. This is what you might see when you go to the Organization and access UI and view groups. The default available groups of Admin and User have access grants automatically created that grant users in those groups access to the roles associated with those groups and to the initial account those users were added in. To create a new access grant that gives a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're logged in with an original user model record, or because you don't have the ability to manage users. For more on such factors, see Factors affecting access. Choose one of the following: Existing: If there is already a group you want to add an access grant to, you can use this. For example, if you want to gives users in the default Admin or User group access to new accounts, you might choose this and then select the Admin Default or Admin User role. New: If you need to create a new group, choose this. You'll also need to choose the authentication domain that group is inside of (for an explanation of what \"Default\" means, see Default groups. If your organization strategy requires a good amount of restrictions over access to accounts and access to roles, you'll probably need to create a good amount of access grants. Next, under Access grant, you'll choose one of following: Account: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are account-scoped. These are the roles that have to do with using and configuring our platform features (and not about organization and user management). Organization: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are organization-scoped. These are the roles that govern organization- and user management. (Note that these users must also already belong to an account-scoped role. This is true for most users but if it's not, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Select the Role you want to assign. Roles are organization-wide, so regardless of the authentication domain you're in, you have access to our standard roles and any custom roles you've created. For tips on selecting roles, see the tips after these instructions. Select the Account you want to add access to from the dropdown. If you don't see an account that you'd expect to see, this may be for a few reasons. One is that you yourself don't have the proper permissions for that account. Another is that that account is not actually in your organization. For more information, see Factors affecting access. If you are still having problems, talk to your account representative. If you want to continue adding more grants for that same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. When you're done, if your users are already in the group you've added the grant to, they should have access within a few minutes (although for EU region New Relic accounts, this can take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true if you just created an access grant with a new group), you'll need to go to the User management UI and add that group to those users. Some tips for using this UI: Note that if a user has the organization-scoped Organization manager and/or Authentication domain manager roles, which is true of users in the default Admin group, those users will always have those capabilities because those are organization-scoped abilities. This means that when you go to add those users to another account, you only have to add an account-scoped role, and not an organization-scoped role. In other words, once the users in a group have those organization-scoped roles, they will always have them in that organization unless removed. When selecting from amongst our standard roles, it's important to understand the difference between All product admin and Standard user. In short, All product admin is more popular a choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure them, you'd choose Standard user. If your users are managed via automated user management, there are some restrictions that may apply. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the User management UI to add users to groups, because groups are managed and imported from your identity provider. If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. Create custom role When creating an access grant, you can use our standard roles, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Review the list of available capabilities and decide which ones your custom role needs. For more information about how roles and capabilities work, see Capabilities. Once you're finished creating a custom role, you will probably want to use it in a new access grant. Add users to groups In the user management UI, you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to. Your users only have access to the access grants associated with the groups they've been added to. To view users and see their groups: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users.

Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are four options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, IncidentIntelligence, or ProactiveDetection. For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost. This is an estimate of costs to date, not your monthly invoice. For more attributes, see the data dictionary.",

      "body": "For users on our New Relic One user model, we provide various user management features, including the ability to: Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to user groups Create custom user groups Grant user groups access to specific roles and accounts Important This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic user versus full user) Note that there are limits around how many times full users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

These charts, offered out-of-the-box, are customizable in that you can: Resize and arrange their positions in your dashboard Update their names, display options, and underlying data queries But sometimes the charts we include in the platform aren't enough for you to get the most from your data. When you want to visualize your data in a specific way that isn't possible with our charts, you can build a custom visualization. New Relic is programmable. This means that if the platform doesn't solve your specific problem, you can write and deploy your own code to fill in some of those gaps. One area where programmability is valuable is in visualizing your data. While New Relic offers all the telemetry data that your apps and services report and provides many different kinds of charts to present that data, you might need to create something entirely unique. With the New Relic One SDK, we've provided you all the tools you'll need to create your own visualizations. Build your custom visualization With the New Relic One SDK, you can create a Nerdpack, which houses your visualization code. This code consists of a React component, logic, data queries, and external dependencies. The SDK also provides a component library that you can use to make NerdGraph requests, access platform state context, and more. Your first visualization To build your first custom visualization, install the New Relic One SDK and make sure you have the latest version: bash Copy $ nr1 update Create a Nerdpack and a visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name custom-viz ✔ You are attempting to create a nerdlet outside of a nerdpack. We will create a nerdpack for you. What would you like to name it? ...my-first-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-first-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization custom-viz is available at \"./my-first-viz/visualizations/custom-viz\" The visualization you created in the my-first-viz Nerdpack contains a default component to help you get started. Serve your visualization locally: bash Copy $ cd my-first-viz $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ custom-viz https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Important To view the locally served visualization, you must use the nerdpacks=local querystring. Enter values into the fields under Configure visualization properties and see how the chart changes: Resources Here is a list of resources for building custom visualizations: Build a custom visualization for dashboards (Guide) Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK (Guide) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Customize your visualization You have a lot of control over how your visualization operates. You can choose what properties of the visualization are customizable, such as colors, sizes, and how you present your legend. You can choose whether it presents New Relic data or data from an external source. You can even install and use third-party components to create a specific look: Resources Here is a list of resources for configuring custom visualizations: Configuration options (Documentation) Customize visualizations with configuration (Guide) Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (Video) Use your custom visualization During development, you can serve your visualization locally. Under Apps > Custom Visualizations, you can view and configure your visualization to see how your data looks, but you can't instantiate that chart and use it in your account: To do that, you need to publish it to the New Relic One catalog and subscribe to it from your account. Because custom visualizations are Nerdpack items, you publish and subscribe to them the same way you publish and subscribe to New Relic One applications. Once you've done so, you can add your custom visualization to a dashboard: If you want to reuse your visualization to present different data or the same data in a new way, you can go back to Apps > Custom Visualizations, choose your visualization, configure another instance and add it to your dashboard: Resources Here is a list of resources for using custom visualizations: Add custom visualizations to your dashboards (Documentation) New Relic Dashboards and Custom Visualizations: Flexibility with Less Toil (Blog) Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (Video) Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (Video)",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

You can also provide access to your Nerdlet from an entity in your account. In this guide, you'll learn how to attach your Nerdlet to your entities. Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install and configure the New Relic One CLI Create a Nerdpack Step 1 of 5 Update your CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 5 Create a Nerdpack with the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack --name entity-nerdlet This results in a Nerdpack, called entity-nerdlet, which consists of a launcher, called entity-nerdlet-launcher, and a Nerdlet, called entity-nerdlet-nerdlet. Step 3 of 5 Serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ cd entity-nerdlet $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 4 of 5 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and navigate to Apps: ?nerdpacks=local is required to enable your locally served Nerdpacks to load in New Relic. Step 5 of 5 Under Your apps, click your launcher to view your New Relic One application: Attach your Nerdlet to entities You've seen how you can access your Nerdlet from a launcher. Now, access your Nerdlet from your entities. Step 1 of 6 From inside your Nerdpack's root directory, open nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json. This is your Nerdlet's metadata file. You'll use this file to attach your Nerdlet to entities. Step 2 of 6 Add a context object with an entities array: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [] 8 } 9 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy This tells New Relic that you want to surface your Nerdlet in an array of entity contexts. Step 3 of 6 Add an entity context: nr1.json 1 { 2 \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", 3 \"id\": \"entity-nerdlet-nerdlet\", 4 \"displayName\": \"EntityNerdletNerdlet\", 5 \"description\": \"\", 6 \"context\": { 7 \"entities\": [ 8 { 9 \"domain\": \"APM\", 10 \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" 11 } 12 ] 13 } 14 } nerdlets/entity-nerdlet-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Here, you've attached your Nerdlet to all application entities in the APM domain. Step 4 of 6 Go to APM: Because you're serving your Nerdpack locally, remember that you must still specify the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 5 of 6 Choose any of your applications: Step 6 of 6 Scroll down to see your Nerdlet attached to the application: Click this menu option and see your Nerdlet the same way you did with the launcher. Configure your entities context The context.entities key in your Nerdlet's nr1.json file specifies which entities your Nerdlet should be attached to. Specify an entity domain Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity domain by specifying the domain as one of the following values: APM: Application Performance Monitoring BROWSER: Browser INFRA: Infrastructure monitoring MOBILE: Mobile monitoring SYNTH: Synthetic monitoring For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities in the APM domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those in a domain: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"!APM\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities in multiple domains: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"APM\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" }] } } Copy Specify an entity type Attach your Nerdlet to a certain entity type by specifying the type as one of the following values: APPLICATION HOST MONITOR For example, attach your Nerdlet to all entities of the APPLICATION type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to all entities except those of a specified type: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"!APPLICATION\" }] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity whose type matches one of an array of types: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }, { \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }] } } Copy Specify entity tags Attach your Nerdlet to entities that have a given tag. For example, attach your Nerdlet to the entity which has a particular GUID: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"guid\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ENTITY GUID>\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Attach your Nerdlet to every entity which has particular accountId and uses the Python programming language: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"accountId\", \"values\": [\"<SOME ACCOUNT ID>\"] }, { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] } ] } } Copy Combine filters When you filter the entities to which your Nerdlet will be added, you can combine domain, type, and tags: { \"context\": { \"entities\": [ { \"domain\": \"APM\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\", \"tags\": [ { \"key\": \"language\", \"values\": [\"python\"] } ] }, { \"domain\": \"SYNTH\", \"type\": \"MONITOR\" }, { \"domain\": \"BROWSER\" } ] } } Copy In this example, you've attached your Nerdlet to: All APM applications whose metadata tags specify the python language AND all Synthetic monitors AND all Browser entities",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Spin up your demo services, before starting this one. One of the primary elements of the New Relic One SDK is the command line interface (CLI). To create a Nerdpack , you'll need to install the SDK, configure the CLI to work with your New Relic account, and then utilize its create command. Install and configure the CLI Step 1 of 5 Go to the Build on New Relic quick start. Step 2 of 5 Get your API key: Once you install the CLI, you'll use this key to create a user profile that's associated with your account. The CLI uses this profile to manage entities within your account. Step 3 of 5 Read and accept the New Relic developer terms and conditions: Even if you install the CLI, you won't be able to use it without first accepting these terms and conditions. Step 4 of 5 Choose your operating system and click Download installer: Once you've installed the SDK, you'll have access to the nr1 CLI. Verify this by checking your SDK version: bash Copy $ nr1 --version If you already had the CLI, update it: bash Copy $ nr1 update Tip It’s important to distinguish between the newrelic CLI and the nr1 CLI. newrelic is for managing entities in your New Relic account. nr1 is for managing New Relic One applications. Step 5 of 5 Copy the command to save your credentials: This command has a profile name, your region, and your API key baked in. Run the command in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:add --name <profile name> --api-key <User key> --region <region> Profiles let you select which New Relic account you want to run commands against. If you have multiple accounts, you can view them with profiles:list: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:list Notice that one profile is your default profile. This is the account your commands will run against, unless you specify another. To specify a profile for a particular command, use the --profile option: bash Copy $ nr1 create --profile <your profile> If this is your first time using the CLI, then the profile you just added is your default profile. If you have other profiles, you need to set your default to the one you'd like to use for this course: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles:default Tip If you forget these commands, you can look them up in the profiles help menu: bash Copy $ nr1 profiles --help Now, you can exit the Build on New Relic quick start.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add navigation to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you finished the A/B test application you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to prepare it for publication. When you publish your app to the New Relic One catalog, users can view it and subscribe to it. You can help your users by showing and telling them what the app does, how to use it, and more. Create catalog information To supply information to the catalog about your app, you need to create the catalog directory in your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 6 Change to the describe-app/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test Step 2 of 6 Create the catalog directories: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog This creates a root catalog directory with template files for inputting custom information about your app and a catalog directory for each Nerdpack item where screenshots can be stored. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog directory. Step 3 of 6 Update catalog/documentation.md: ## Documentation This application combines and presents data from New Relic and the Nerdsletter API so that we can make an informed decision on which design version results in more high-quality newsletter subscriptions. It also presents an button to end the test, which saves the date and version descriptions in local storage. We can use this app for future A/B tests as well! catalog/documentation.md Copy For this course, you're keeping the documentation concise by merely describing what the app does. In your own projects, you might also include instructions for contributing to the project in an open source context, installing the app's dependencies, or anything else that might help a user navigate complexities in your app or code. Step 4 of 6 Update catalog/config.json: { \"tagline\": \"Win @ newsletter subscriptions\", \"details\": \"Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course\", \"whatsNew\": \"Initial release! Includes:\\n- A variety of charts for understanding the test results\\n- An end test button for storing some test data in a table\", \"support\": { \"email\": { \"address\": \"\" }, \"issues\": { \"url\": \"\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"\" } } } catalog/config.json Copy Here, you've specified a tagline, project details, the source code repository, and a short list of everything included in the initial release. In other projects, you might also add a support email or support links. Step 5 of 6 Save the this screenshot to your catalog/screenshots directory. Users will be able to see a carousel of screenshots in your app's About page in the catalog. Step 6 of 6 Save the following icon as icon.png in two places: nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test/launchers/ab-test-launcher This will act as the launcher's icon and the app's catalog icon on the About page. Now you've added documentation, screenshots, metadata, and an icon to your app so that users will be able to understand what it does and why they might need it. For now, these files are all local and they need to be submitted to the catalog. But before you can do that, your app, itself, needs to be published to the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll publish your app, submit your catalog information, and view the results in New Relic.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Fetch data from a third-party service, before starting this one. In this course, you're building a New Relic One application. This application shows telemetry data from a demo service that is running an A/B test so that it can reveal that data in charts, like a dashboard. Your New Relic application is different than a dashboard, however, because it does more than show New Relic data. It pulls external data, provides UI components and functionality, and even has its own small data stores. The purpose of this New Relic application is to present context so you can better understand the A/B test results and how those results tie in to your business objectives. So far, you've built all your charts, organized them for improved usability, provided them with real data, and more. There are some final improvements you can make, using Platform API components. In this lesson, you learn how to use values in the New Relic platform state. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-platform-state-context/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, add a PlatformStateContext.Consumer to your NewsletterSignups component's render() method: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Notice that NrqlQuery uses a constant called ACCOUNT_ID. Instead of hardcoding an account identifier in your Nerdlet, you can use accountId from the platform URL state. Step 3 of 10 PlatformStateContext.Consumer provides access to the platform's URL state. This context contains an important value you'll use in your app, called timeRange. Notice that your NrqlQuery uses a SINCE clause that identifies the historical timeframe your query should fetch data from. Right now, that SINCE clause is set to 30 MINUTES AGO. With timeRange, you can use the platform's time picker to make this timeframe adjustable. Step 4 of 10 Utilize the platform state's timeRange: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, NewsletterSignups uses platformState.timeRange instead of a hardcoded SINCE clause. While NrqlQuery components accept a convenient timeRange prop, not every component does. You can still use timeRange in other contexts by accessing duration, begin_time, or end_time: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { console.log(platformState.timeRange.duration); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>; Copy Step 5 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test. Step 6 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 7 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 10 View your application: Your NrqlQuery now uses the platform state's timeRange, but your chart probably still shows the last 30 minutes. Why? Where does the timeRange in platform state come from? The time picker sits on the right side of your application's navigation bar: Change this value and see your chart update: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 9 of 10 Update VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Of all the charts in your New Relic One application, these three charts are the ones that should update with the time picker. The others, Total subscriptions per version, Total cancellations per version, Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions, Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, show total values over time. So, hardcoding their SINCE clauses to 7 DAYS AGO makes sense, as this is a reasonable time period for the purposes of this course. Step 10 of 10 While still serving your Nerdpack locally, view your NR1 app to see your charts updating with the time range you choose: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now that you're basing your queries off the platform state, some of your charts are dynamic in their time ranges. This is a great improvement because it allows you to adjust your charts to show data from any particular point in time, which is useful for tying data to business outcomes. The Platform API components offer a lot more functionality, too, including the ability to navigate the user to another place in New Relic. You'll learn how to do this in the next lesson.

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

When you build a New Relic One application, it's valuable to view it on the platform. This helps you design, implement, and debug your application in the environment it will eventually be published to.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add chart components to your A/B test application, before starting this one. In this course, you’re building an A/B test application for the New Relic platform. Previously, you learned about the New Relic One SDK and its component library. Now, It’s time for you to start building your application focusing first on chart components. Before you write any code, consult your design guide to remember what the application will look like when you finish: There are several charts you need to create, which may seem overwhelming at first, but take it one step at a time. The topmost chart, and the first you’ll create, is a line chart that shows the number of users who sign up for your newsletter and what version of your website they were shown. Step 1 of 8 Change to the add-your-first-chart/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-your-first-chart/ab-test This directory contains the code your application should have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 8 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named newsletter-signups.js: bash Copy $ touch newsletter-signups.js Step 3 of 8 In this new file, create a component called NewsletterSignups to hold your first LineChart and some mock data: import React from 'react'; import { LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { const versionASignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-a-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 20, y: 15 }, { x: 30, y: 5 }, { x: 40, y: 30 }, { x: 50, y: 25 }, ], } const versionBSignups = { metadata: { id: 'version-b-newsletter-signups', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 20 }, { x: 10, y: 5 }, { x: 20, y: 25 }, { x: 30, y: 45 }, { x: 40, y: 50 }, { x: 50, y: 35 }, ], } return <LineChart data={[versionASignups, versionBSignups]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Here, you’ve created two arbitrary data series which represent versions A and B of your test. Right now, you're using manually-crafted data points. In the future, you'll replace these with data queried from New Relic. Notice that you’ve specified a color for each series in the chart. The color metadata attribute takes any CSS-acceptable color format. Setting viz: 'main' means that you want to render the LineChart series as a line, the component's default display style. For the data prop in the LineChart component, you passed the two series in an array so that both are represented together. Finally, you used the chart’s fullWidth prop to stretch the chart’s width to fill the view. Step 4 of 8 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and replace the default heading in your Nerdlet's render() method with your new component: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 8 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-your-first-chart/ab-test. Step 6 of 8 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 7 of 8 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 8 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the LineChart displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. In seven steps, you’ve breathed life into your New Relic One application. Instead of a bland “Hello world” message, your application now shows a colorful line chart with two mocked data series. These data series represent server-side traffic for each of the competing designs in your demo website. In the next lesson, you’ll build on this foundation by creating another chart type.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add your first chart, before starting this one. You’ve begun building your A/B test application. So far, it consists of a single line chart, which represents the number of subscriptions your newsletter receives from each version of your website. To understand what you’ll build in this lesson, review the design guide to remember what charts come next: In the design, there are two pie charts beneath the line chart that you’ve already created. One represents the distribution of users who receive version A and version B. The other represents the distribution of successful requests from users who got version A and version B. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-pie-charts/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add two new Javascript files: total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js bash Copy $ touch total-subscriptions.js total-cancellations.js Step 3 of 9 In total-subscriptions.js, create a component, called TotalSubscriptions, which renders mocked subscription data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalSubscriptions extends React.Component { render() { const subscriptionsA = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 259 }, ], } const subscriptionsB = { metadata: { id: 'subscriptions-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 318 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[subscriptionsA, subscriptionsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Notice that the series data is formatted differently for PieChart than it was for LineChart. Because PieChart uses unidimensional data, its series only take y-values. Step 4 of 9 In total-cancellations.js, create a component, called TotalCancellations, which renders mocked cancellation data: import React from 'react'; import { PieChart } from 'nr1'; export default class TotalCancellations extends React.Component { render() { const cancellationsA = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-A', name: 'Version A', viz: 'main', color: 'blue', }, data: [ { y: 118 }, ], } const cancellationsB = { metadata: { id: 'cancellations-B', name: 'Version B', viz: 'main', color: 'green', }, data: [ { y: 400 }, ], } return <PieChart data={[cancellationsA, cancellationsB]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/total-subscriptions.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new components and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-pie-charts/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the PieChart components displayed in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Your application is starting to take shape. You’ve created a line chart and two pie charts. For now, these charts use mocked data, but you’ll provide them real data in a later lesson. Before you focus on the data in your charts, however, you’ll learn how to add a table to your application so you can visualize data in a new way. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. When you're ready, continue on to the next lesson: Add tables.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

The New Relic One application that you're building throughout this course allows developers to A/B test their websites. To run a successful A/B test, site owners need to be able to analyze the results. Without knowing how each design performs, how will developers determine which design to use? Here is a mockup for the A/B test application you're building: Your application displays data for two competing versions. With various charts and tables, your users will be able to analyze the results of their test and make informed decisions on which design will work best to achieve their goals. You’ll refer back to this mockup many times throughout this course. It shows you what charts to create, how to organize them, and what kind of data to provide them. In the next four sections, you learn how to create every chart that your A/B test application needs to operate effectively. After that, you’ll arrange the charts to match the mockup’s design and supply New Relic data collected from the demo applications you spun up earlier.

Browser can also monitor asynchronous page load timing. Page load process Here are the major steps in the loading of most web pages. The numbers 1-6 in the diagram correspond to the numbered steps below. Page load timeline: The steps involved in a web page load. Browser monitoring charts display the following segments of that process: Network, Web application, DOM processing, and Page rendering. A page load begins when a user selects a hyperlink, submits a form, or types a URL in a browser. This is also referred to as the initial request or the navigation start. The user's action sends a request across the network to the web application server. The request reaches the application for processing. (The request may take some time to start being processed. This could be the result of request queuing or it could be other factors.) The app finishes processing and sends an HTML response back across the network to the user's browser. This is sometimes referred to as response start or first byte. (Time To First Byte) The user's browser begins receiving the HTML response, and starts to process the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM finishes loading; this point is known as DOM ready. Using the DOM, the user's browser starts to render the page. The page finishes rendering in the user's browser and the window load event fires. (For pages that use asynchronous loading, some elements may continue to load after the window load event occurs.) Page load time charts in browser monitoring Browser monitoring captures the major page load timing segments in the browser Summary page and the Page views page. If you have SPA monitoring enabled, you will have access to both this chart and SPA-specific charts. The charts show: Network Web application time DOM processing Page rendering Other segments as applicable, such as request queuing The chart colors match the colors in the page load timing diagram. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Summary: The load time chart appears on the Summary and Page views page. The way browser collects these times depends on the browser's capability to use the Navigation Timing Specification API. You can add custom page load timing events with the browser agent API. Here are descriptions of the activity included in the browser load time chart segments: Web application The web application time includes the time spent on the application server. This can only be determined if the browser instrumentation for page load timing was provided by an APM agent. Network The Network layer includes time spent in redirects as well as in requesting and receiving HTML. It does not include time on the server or for static assets. Network time measurement starts from the initial click on a link. Network time includes DNS and may include more than one lookup if you have redirects on your site, TCP (including the firewall, unless you have configured request queue time monitoring), and SSL connect time. If you have configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does not include any of the request queue time that occurs after the X-Request header. If you have not configured request queue time monitoring, then the network time does include all of the request queue time. The Navigation Timing Specification API provides a detailed breakdown of network time. (For old browsers, the timer starts on the \"before unload event.\") For apps that have been deployed using the copy/paste method, Browser includes web app and queue time in Network time. This is because browser relies on the server-side agent to pass the application values to the browser agent through auto-injection. For more information about how this back-end time breaks down from the browser's point of view, use the Session traces page. The session traces report on all the network related events available, so you can see on a case-by-case basis how the browser is spending time on DNS lookups and other network events. Important Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time. This is because the front-end server does not add the queueing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. If the front-end server is configured in some way that causes requests to start backlogging and to queue up in the listener socket that the front-end server uses to accept connections, then you will see network time increase for browser monitoring. The queueing time headers can never account for backlog in this listener socket. DOM processing DOM processing is the time it takes to parse the HTML into a DOM and retrieve or execute synchronous scripts. If the browser starts to download images in this phase, page load timing will capture the image load time. The DOM processing and page rendering layers include network time for static assets (assets that are not explicitly retrieved after page load). However, if a script on the page dynamically inserts image tags and loads images after the server or content delivery system (CDN) finishes, page load timing cannot capture the image load time. Page rendering The Page rendering phase is the time between the DOM being complete and the window load event. This phase measures browser-side processing of the page content, and often includes time for scripts and static assets to load. Request queuing Request queuing will be displayed in the load time chart if your account has both browser and APM linked. In New Relic, request queuing refers to the time between a request entering your production systems and it reaching your application. Depending on the specifics of your production infrastructure, this time may include an actual queue that requests enter, or it may represent other functions that take time (such as load balancing or internal network latency). App server requests vs. browser transactions Often the number of app server transactions (requests per minute or rpm) is larger than the number of browser transactions (pages per minute or ppm) for the same application. For more information, see the troubleshooting procedures. Outliers No matter how well your application performs, there will be some slow browsers, platforms, and networks that make your overall aggregate response times appear slower. To minimize the skew caused by outliers, page load timing clamps and scales the end user response times that are greater than 4.5 times your application's browser Apdex T setting to 4.5 times the Apdex T, or to 13.5 seconds, whichever is greater. (Histogram outliers are cut off at 95%.) For example, if your application's end user Apdex T threshold is 8 seconds, those response times will be clamped at 36 seconds. This minimizes the impact of these response times on your overall application but still provides accounting for \"frustrated\" Apdex scores. For SPA monitoring, outliers are handled differently. When the duration of an initial page load or route change reaches 30 minutes, that event is treated as invalid data and is discarded.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add tables, before starting this one. In previous lessons, you added a variety of charts to your A/B test application. These charts presented different facets of information about your A/B test, and they behaved independently from one other. In this lesson, you’ll create a new pair of line charts and learn how to synchronize their behaviors. Before you write any new code, consult your design guide to understand the role that these new charts will play in your application: In the design guide, there is a line graph under each of the tables you created in the last lesson. These line graphs show the version-specific response times for newsletter signup requests. Now, you’ll build two more line charts, but this time, you’ll group them with a ChartGroup and specify that their values are measured in milliseconds. Step 1 of 9 Change to the add-a-chart-group/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test Step 2 of 9 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, add a new Javascript file named page-views.js: bash Copy $ touch page-views.js Step 3 of 9 In this new file, create a component called VersionPageViews to hold a LineChart, which shows the number of times a page is viewed: import React from 'react'; import { LineChart } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { const versionPageViews = { metadata: { id: `page-views-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version.toUpperCase()}`, viz: 'main', color: 'blue', units_data: { y: 'MS' } }, data: [ { x: 0, y: 10 }, { x: 10, y: 13 }, { x: 20, y: 11.5 }, { x: 30, y: 10 }, { x: 40, y: 8.75 }, { x: 50, y: 9 }, ], } return <LineChart data={[versionPageViews]} fullWidth /> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Notice the new attribute in the series' metadata fields: units_data. This attribute describes the unit type for a specified data axis. In this case, you set the unit type for the y axis to 'MS', which stands for milliseconds. Other options for unit types, include: 'PERCENTAGE', 'TIMESTAMP', and 'BYTES_PER_SECOND'. Step 4 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import your new component and update your Nerdlet's render() method: import React from 'react'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Step 5 of 9 In index.js, import ChartGroup from nr1 and group your VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <NewsletterSignups /> <TotalSubscriptions /> <TotalCancellations /> <VersionTotals version='a' /> <VersionTotals version='b' /> <ChartGroup> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </ChartGroup> <PastTests /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Because the tables are conceptually related, as they show contrasting performance metrics over the same timeslice, it makes sense to group them in a ChartGroup. This means that the two charts behave synchronously. For example, when you hover over one chart, the other chart shows a hover indicator at the same x coordinate. Step 6 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-chart-group/ab-test. Step 7 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 8 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 9 of 9 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see the LineChart components synchronized in your application. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Tip Each of the chart component types you've used in this lesson have had different series configurations. Most chart components share the same metadata attributes, like LineChart and PieChart, but differ in their data formats. It's helpful to be aware of the different data formats, for when you create your own charts. You can read more about the data formats in the chart component documentation. Now your application is filled with charts, but it doesn't look great. The charts are stacked on top of one another in an unhelpful way. In the next lesson, you'll learn about the user interface components from the SDK and how you can use them to organize your charts.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add user interface components to your application, before starting this one. In previous hands-on lessons, you created all the charts from your design guide. Unfortunately, they aren’t laid out like they are in the design. The New Relic One SDK provides multiple solutions for organizing your components. The one you’ll learn about in this lesson is the Grid component. To arrange your charts, place them in a Grid. A Grid is a container you use to organize your content into 12-column rows. A GridItem is the building block for a Grid. You specify the columnSpan of a GridItem between 1 and 12 to determine how much of the row that the GridItem should cover. So, if you want a chart to stretch across the width of the view, you would place the chart in a GridItem with a columnSpan of 12. If you want twelve charts to fit in a single row, use a columnSpan of 1. Using the design guide as a base, you can plan how to organize your Grid: Once you’ve planned out how you’re going to arrange your columns, you can write some code to realize your plans. Step 1 of 6 Change to the add-a-grid/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test Step 2 of 6 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, import Grid and GridItem. Then, update your Nerdlet's render() method by placing each chart in a GrildItem. Finally, place all your items in a Grid: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='a' /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><VersionTotals version='b' /></GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy The columnSpan for each chart matches the layout plan. Every chart that takes up half the 12-column row has a columnSpan of 6, and every chart that takes up the whole row has a columnSpan of 12. Notice that each of the charts in the ChartGroup, but not the ChartGroup itself, is in a GridItem. A ChartGroup connects charts' behaviors, not their locations. Each chart fills its columnSpan because they use the fullWidth prop. fullWidth makes the chart fill its available horizontal space and GridItem.columnSpan restricts that space to some fraction of the row. Remove a fullWidth prop, and see how the chart reacts. Technical detail Notice the wrapper class applied to the Grid. We quietly provided some CSS styles to help make this app look great! This isn't a CSS course, so we won't cover everything we added, we'll just include the styles we intend for you to use in the code snippets. Just know that every UI component in the New Relic One SDK provides a className prop where you can provide a CSS class name. You can view the styles in nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/styles.scss. Step 3 of 6 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-a-grid/ab-test. Step 4 of 6 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 6 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 6 View your changes in New Relic: Here, you see your charts styled and arranged in a grid. When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. In just six steps, you significantly improved the readability and usability of your A/B test application, but you can take further steps to improve the usability of your charts. In the next lesson, you’ll add headings to your charts to remind yourself of what data each chart presents. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. When you're ready, continue on to the next lesson: Add chart headings.",

The API Explorer also includes the curl request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. You can also create alert conditions in the UI. Important For infrastructure alerting, see REST API for infrastructure monitoring alerts. Available data and functions via API REST API functions Comments View account data In general, any role can use a user key or REST API key with GET > List functions to view alerts data. The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for Synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new policies To add new policies, use your user key and include these two values in the API call: Required values Definition Incident incident_preference Determines how Alerts will create incidents and group violations.

You'll need your user key. Required values Definition id Required. To find a policy's ID, use either of these options: From the UI: On a policy's UI page, find the ID under the policy name. With the API: Use the List policies API. Incident incident_preference Determines how alerts will create incidents and group violations. Must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name Required.

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_timer. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Step 4. Assign users and groups Next, you'll assign users in Okta's New Relic application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. Assignments tab In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Highly recommended: Set your users' time zones in Okta. The time zone affects how date/times for that user are shown in New Relic. Users without a time zone configured will be shown in UTC time in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). There are several ways in Okta to assign users' time zone, so consult the Okta docs for more information if needed. Here is one way to do this in the Assignments tab: In the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Manage user type If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, the count of your full users is a billing factor. To change some of your users to free basic users, you have two choices: Manage user type from New Relic using the User management UI, OR Manage user type from Okta (described below). To manage your users' user type from Okta: Go to the New Relic authentication domain UI and click Enable Manage user type with SCIM. Note that when this is enabled, you can’t manage user type from the New Relic UI and can only manage it from Okta. Go into your Okta instance. The rest of these instructions are done from Okta. Next, you'll configure Okta to be able to send a new attribute nrUserType. Steps: Go to the Profile editor. In the Attributes section, click Add attribute. Set your settings to match the screenshot below (except for the variable name, which is created automatically). The only two fields that must match exactly are External name and External namespace. The value for External namespace must be urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User Next, you'll configure your Okta user profile to have this field. Steps: In the Profile editor, go to Users and click the User (default) profile. Add a new New Relic user type attribute to that profile (see Okta user profile instructions). How you set this will depend on your own setup and preferences for defining user type. Note that the expected values for user type are Basic user and Full user. Below is an example with information filled in. In the People section, define the user type for your users. How you do this will depend on your setup and preferences. For example, you may choose to set this manually by setting each user’s user type, or you may use Okta to manage these in bulk. Next, you’ll set up mapping for that attribute. Steps: In the app's Provisioning section, click Unmapped attributes. Go into edit mode for the unmapped New Relic user type attribute. Configure it based on how you want to set the user type. To learn about why you'd set them as basic users or full users, see User type. Learn more about Okta attribute mappings. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you're able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add NrqlQuery components to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In this series, you're creating a New Relic One application, or NR1 app for short, that shows A/B test data in a variety of charts. Most of the charts need to show data that comes from a demo service you spun up at the beginning of this series. To refresh your memory on what you're building, review your design guide: In the last lesson, you supplied real data, which comes from New Relic's database, to the following charts: Newsletter subscriptions per version Version A - Page views Version B - Page views Total subscriptions per version Because you have experience querying subscription and page view data, you may feel ready to supply data to even more charts: Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions However, these charts are different than the charts you've supplied data to because they compare data from two different sources: subscription events and pageView events. In this lesson, you learn how to format data from multiple sources to exist in the same chart. Experiment with data in the Data explorer Step 1 of 6 From your New Relic homepage's top navigation menu, go to to the Data explorer: Here, you can experiment with subscription event and pageView event queries to make sure you fetch the right data in your app. Step 2 of 6 Select subscription from the Custom events menu: This queries NRDB for subscription event totals per minute over the last 30 minutes and shows that data in a chart: Step 3 of 6 Click Dimensions to see a list of the attributes associated with these subscription events: You can filter and group subscription events using these dimensions. For Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, you want to filter your subscription totals by page_version. Step 4 of 6 Click the NRQL query to navigate to the Query builder: Here, you can view and manually edit the query to fetch the data you need. Step 5 of 6 Add a WHERE clause to filter subscription totals by page_version: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Remove the TIMESERIES clause to fetch a count: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO Copy Modify the SINCE clause to see totals over the past week: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO Copy Click Run and see the data visualized in a billboard chart instead of a line chart: Step 6 of 6 Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions and Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions need a combined total of four data values: All-time subscription totals for version A All-time page view totals for version A All-time subscription totals for version B All-time page view totals for version B Experiment with the Query builder to discover the four queries which pull the right data. In the end, you'll come up with the following four queries: SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = 'a' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = 'b' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = 'b' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO Copy technical detail Unlike other structured query languages, NRQL doesn't provide a mechanism for joining data across sources. This is why you have to perform two queries to get subscription event totals and pageView event totals. Until now, you've provided every chart with a single query. Here, you have to provide two queries per chart. In the remaining steps, you'll learn how to customize NrqlQuery results to merge data from multiple sources. Merge NRQL from multiple sources Step 1 of 9 Change to the customize-nrql-data/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/customize-nrql-data/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 9 In your Nerdlet's totals.js file, implement constructor() and the React lifecycle method componentDidMount() in VersionTotals: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { tableData: { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } } } componentDidMount() { NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[0].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[1].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[this.state.tableData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Here, you initialize your state in the component's constructor. The state has a single value, tableData, which holds series data and metadata for the TableChart. In componentDidMount(), you query the data that populates the data in this state. componentDidMount() is a React lifecycle method that is called when a component is mounted in the component tree. You use this method, instead of the constructor, to query data because your logic, which requests data from New Relic, introduces side effects and sets state values, neither of which you should do in the constructor. In componentDidMount(), you use NrqlQuery in a new way. First, you specified the formatType to NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW because you're going to modify the data instead of supplying it directly to a chart Before, you used its JSX form in the render() method of a chart. Second, you called its query() method and handled the results in a then() callback, which logs them to the console. Step 3 of 9 In your Nerdlet's index.js file, create a constant called ACCOUNT_ID and pass it to VersionTotals: import React from 'react'; import { ChartGroup, Grid, GridItem } from 'nr1'; import EndTestSection from './end-test'; import NewsletterSignups from './newsletter-signups'; import PastTests from './past-tests'; import TotalCancellations from './total-cancellations'; import TotalSubscriptions from './total-subscriptions'; import VersionDescription from './description'; import VersionPageViews from './page-views'; import VersionTotals from './totals'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID> const VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter\"' const VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION = 'The newsletter signup message says, \"Sign up for our newsletter and get a free shirt!\"' export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Grid className=\"wrapper\"> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_A_DESCRIPTION} version=\"A\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionDescription description={VERSION_B_DESCRIPTION} version=\"B\" /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><hr /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><NewsletterSignups /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalSubscriptions /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}><TotalCancellations /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='a' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionTotals version='b' accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} /> </GridItem> <ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='a' /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={6}> <VersionPageViews version='b' /> </GridItem> </ChartGroup> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><EndTestSection /></GridItem> <GridItem columnSpan={12}><PastTests /></GridItem> </Grid> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/ Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Step 4 of 9 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/customize-nrql-data/ab-test. Step 5 of 9 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 6 of 9 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Navigate to your app in New Relic. Step 7 of 9 To view your logs, which are useful for uncovering errors in your application, turn on developer tools in your favorite browser and navigate to the Console: FireFox instructions Safari instructions Chrome instructions With your app on-screen, notice the NRQL data in the console: This console log tells you that you can find the data you're looking for, namely the subscription or pageView count, at data.raw.results[0].count. The next step is to store that count in state.tableData. Tip If something doesn't work, use these debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 8 of 9 In totals.js, store the query data in state: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, NrqlQuery, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; export default class VersionTotals extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { tableData: { metadata: { id: `totals-${this.props.version}`, name: `Version ${this.props.version}`, columns: ['name', 'count'], }, data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], } } } componentDidMount() { NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM subscription WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[0].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) NrqlQuery.query({ accountId: this.props.accountId, query: `SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' SINCE 7 DAYS AGO`, formatType: NrqlQuery.FORMAT_TYPE.RAW }).then(({ data }) => { if (data.raw) { let tableData = {...this.state.tableData} tableData.data[1].count = data.raw.results[0].count this.setState({tableData}) } }) } render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views vs. subscriptions </HeadingText> <TableChart data={[this.state.tableData]} fullWidth /> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/totals.js Copy Pay close attention to the data you're accessing. The array indices are particularly important to get right. The subscription data should go to state.tableData.data[0].count because in tableData, it is the first element in the data array: data: [ { name: 'Subscriptions', count: 0 }, { name: 'Page views', count: 0 }, ], Copy By similar logic, page view data should go to state.tableData.data[1].count. Step 9 of 9 With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your charts serving real data: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID In this lesson, you learned how to use NrqlQuery.query() to fetch data from multiple sources and stitch them together into data your chart can use. Notice that there are still two charts in your NR1 application that use mock data: Total unsubscriptions per version Past tests Unfortunately, your demo application doesn't create custom New Relic events when a user unsubscribes from your newsletter or you end an A/B test. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to use NerdGraph and NerdStorage to populate Past tests.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Persist the selected version, before starting this one. In this tutorial, you're building an A/B test application. The application surfaces data about an ongoing A/B test on your website, which you then use to decide which page design version is most effective at engaging users. As part of that overarching goal, you're building a section which allows you to end the test by deciding a winner of the experiment: Unfortunately, there are a few issues with the code and design for this section. By the end of this course, pressing End test will tell your website's backend server that every customer should see the version selected here. This is destructive behavior because it makes an irreversible change to your website. To account for the desctructiveness of pressing End test, you need to modify some features of your application: Make the button look important to catch your eye Prompt yourself with a confirmation message before ending the test to ensure you don't end it prematurely Show and hide your confirmation modal Step 1 of 12 Change to the present-confirmation-modal/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test This directory contains the code your application should have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 12 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js, update the Button to use the DESTRUCTIVE styling: import React from 'react'; import { Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Tip Read more about Button and its props on the New Relic developer site. Step 3 of 12 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/present-confirmation-modal/ab-test. Step 4 of 12 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. Step 5 of 12 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 6 of 12 Go to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your application under Apps > Your apps: Now you've styled your button to convey its destructive consequences, but that's not enough to prevent you from accidentally clicking it. Next, you create a shield for your website's backend. This extra layer of protection requires you to confirm that you intend to end the test before actually doing so. Step 7 of 12 Add a Modal to EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Your new modal contains a heading, a confirmation message, the winning design version, and two buttons. You'll explore some of these components later in this course. With your Nerdpack served locally, view your application to see your new Modal: Tip Remember, while your server is running, it will update automatically when you save your code. The modal looks great, but it has three issues: It was present before you clicked End test You can't dismiss it It always says you selected \"Version A\", even if you didn't In the following steps, you'll correct all three of these issues. Step 8 of 12 In EndTestButton, initialize state with a value for modalHidden: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy modalHidden determines whether or not to hide the modal. The default value of modalHidden is true because you only want to show the modal when you select End test. Step 9 of 12 Supply modalHidden to the Modal: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy First, you've created a constructor to accept component props. This provides your component access to the modalHidden prop that you passed in EndTestSection. Then you provide the value of modalHidden to the Modal component's hidden prop. Tip Read more about Modal and its props on the New Relic developer site. Step 10 of 12 Add and bind two new methods to EndTestSection: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Use closeModal and showModal to close and show your modal, respectively, depending on how a user interacts with the modal. Step 11 of 12 Show the modal when you click End test: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Here, you've supplied showModal() as the callback for the Button component's onClick event. Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. The modal is hidden by default. Click End test to see the modal. Step 12 of 12 Close the modal from the Modal component's onClose callback and from the Yes, end test and No, continue test buttons: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Click End test. The modal opens and displays your confirmation message. Close the modal by clicking X at the top right, either of its buttons, or even in the dark space to its left. Notice that the modal says you chose \"Version A\", even if you choose \"Version B\". This is because \"Version A\" is hardcoded in the Modal text. Next, you'll make that dynamic. Use the version you selected in your modal Step 1 of 2 In EndTestSection, pass selectedVersion to the EndTestButton: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version A</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Now, you can access the selected version from the EndTestButton component's props. Step 2 of 2 Use selectedVersion in your confirmation message: import React from 'react'; import { BlockText, Button, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, Modal, Select, SelectItem, } from 'nr1'; class VersionSelector extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); } render() { return <Select onChange={this.props.selectVersion} value={this.props.selectedVersion}> <SelectItem value={'A'}>Version A</SelectItem> <SelectItem value={'B'}>Version B</SelectItem> </Select> } } class EndTestButton extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { modalHidden: true, } this.showModal = this.showModal.bind(this); this.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this); } closeModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: true }); } showModal() { this.setState({ modalHidden: false }); } render() { return <div> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.showModal}>End test</Button> <Modal hidden={this.state.modalHidden} onClose={this.closeModal}> <HeadingText>Are you sure?</HeadingText> <BlockText> If you end the test, all your users will receive the version you selected: </BlockText> <BlockText spacingType={[BlockText.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE]}> <b>Version {this.props.selectedVersion}</b> </BlockText> <Button onClick={this.closeModal}>No, continue test</Button> <Button type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} onClick={this.closeModal}>Yes, end test</Button> </Modal> </div> } } export default class EndTestSection extends React.Component { constructor() { super(...arguments); this.state = { selectedVersion: 'A', }; this.selectVersion = this.selectVersion.bind(this); } selectVersion(event, value) { this.setState({ selectedVersion: value }); } render() { return <Grid className=\"endTestSection\"> <GridItem columnSpan={12}> <HeadingText className=\"endTestHeader\"> Pick the winner of your A/B test: </HeadingText> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={5} columnEnd={6} className=\"versionSelector\"> <VersionSelector selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion} selectVersion={this.selectVersion} /> </GridItem> <GridItem columnStart={7} columnEnd={8}> <EndTestButton selectedVersion={this.state.selectedVersion}>End test</EndTestButton> </GridItem> </Grid> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/end-test.js Copy Go back to https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local, and view your changes. Select \"Version B\" from the menu. Click End test to see \"Version B\" in the confirmation modal: When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Congratulations! You've done a lot of work and it shows in the usefulness of your application. You've created charts that show mocked data. You've organized your charts into a readable structure. You've added an interface for your users to interact with the test. Now, you need some real data. In the next lesson, you'll replace the mocked data in your charts with real data from your backend service.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add a new configuration option Step 1 of 8 In your visualization's nr1.json file, add an enum configuration object for selectedChart: index.js nr1.json 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 Radar: 'radar', 24 Treemap: 'treemap', 25 }; 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

Step 3 of 8 Serve your Nerdpack locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve If you're still serving your Nerdpack from the last lesson, you need to stop it with CTRL-X and serve it again to reflect changes to nr1.json. Step 4 of 8 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The nerdpacks=local query string directs the UI to load your visualization from the local server. Step 5 of 8 Open the Apps page: Step 6 of 8 Go to Custom Visualizations, which is favorited by default: Step 7 of 8 In Custom Visualizations, find and click your visualization: Step 8 of 8 Notice the new Select chart configuration option: Selecting a chart type doesn't effect your visualization. This is because you first need to introduce the selectedChart property to the visualization component. Then, you use selectedChart to determine the chart type to render. Replace your SegmentedControl with the configurable property Step 1 of 5 Open your visualization's index.js file. You'll be working here for the rest of the guide.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Fetch data from a third-party service, before starting this one. In this course, you're building a New Relic One application. This application shows telemetry data from a demo service that is running an A/B test so that it can reveal that data in charts, like a dashboard. Your New Relic application is different than a dashboard, however, because it does more than show New Relic data. It pulls external data, provides UI components and functionality, and even has its own small data stores. The purpose of this New Relic application is to present context so you can better understand the A/B test results and how those results tie in to your business objectives. So far, you've built all your charts, organized them for improved usability, provided them with real data, and more. There are some final improvements you can make, using Platform API components. In this lesson, you learn how to use values in the New Relic platform state. Step 1 of 10 Change to the add-platform-state-context/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 10 In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js, add a PlatformStateContext.Consumer to your NewsletterSignups component's render() method: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES\" pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Notice that NrqlQuery uses a constant called ACCOUNT_ID. Instead of hardcoding an account identifier in your Nerdlet, you can use accountId from the platform URL state. Step 3 of 10 PlatformStateContext.Consumer provides access to the platform's URL state. This context contains an important value you'll use in your app, called timeRange. Notice that your NrqlQuery uses a SINCE clause that identifies the historical timeframe your query should fetch data from. Right now, that SINCE clause is set to 30 MINUTES AGO. With timeRange, you can use the platform's time picker to make this timeframe adjustable. Step 4 of 10 Utilize the platform state's timeRange: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 123456 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class NewsletterSignups extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Newsletter subscriptions per version </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query=\"SELECT count(*) FROM subscription FACET page_version TIMESERIES\" timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/newsletter-signups.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Now, NewsletterSignups uses platformState.timeRange instead of a hardcoded SINCE clause. While NrqlQuery components accept a convenient timeRange prop, not every component does. You can still use timeRange in other contexts by accessing duration, begin_time, or end_time: <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> {(platformState) => { console.log(platformState.timeRange.duration); }} </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>; Copy Step 5 of 10 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/add-platform-state-context/ab-test. Step 6 of 10 Generate a new UUID for your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf Because you cloned the coursework repository that contained an existing Nerdpack, you need to generate your own unique identifier. This UUID maps your Nerdpack to your New Relic account. It also allows your app to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of your account. Step 7 of 10 Serve your application locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Step 8 of 10 View your application: Your NrqlQuery now uses the platform state's timeRange, but your chart probably still shows the last 30 minutes. Why? Where does the timeRange in platform state come from? The time picker sits on the right side of your application's navigation bar: Change this value and see your chart update: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID Step 9 of 10 Update VersionPageViews: import React from 'react'; import { HeadingText, LineChart, NrqlQuery, PlatformStateContext, } from 'nr1'; const ACCOUNT_ID = 1234567 // <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> export default class VersionPageViews extends React.Component { render() { return <div> <HeadingText className=\"chartHeader\"> Version {this.props.version.toUpperCase()} - Page views </HeadingText> <PlatformStateContext.Consumer> { (platformState) => { return <NrqlQuery accountId={ACCOUNT_ID} query={`SELECT count(*) FROM pageView WHERE page_version = '${this.props.version}' TIMESERIES`} timeRange={platformState.timeRange} pollInterval={60000} > { ({ data }) => { return <LineChart data={data} fullWidth />; } } </NrqlQuery> } } </PlatformStateContext.Consumer> </div> } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/page-views.js Copy Important Make sure you replace <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> with your actual New Relic account ID. Of all the charts in your New Relic One application, these three charts are the ones that should update with the time picker. The others, Total subscriptions per version, Total cancellations per version, Version A - Page views vs. subscriptions, Version B - Page views vs. subscriptions, show total values over time. So, hardcoding their SINCE clauses to 7 DAYS AGO makes sense, as this is a reasonable time period for the purposes of this course. Step 10 of 10 While still serving your Nerdpack locally, view your NR1 app to see your charts updating with the time range you choose: Tip If something doesn't work, use your browser's debug tools to try to identify the problem. Make sure you: Copied the code correctly from the lesson Generated a new UUID Replaced all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID When you're finished, stop serving your New Relic One application by pressing CTRL+C in your local server's terminal window. Now that you're basing your queries off the platform state, some of your charts are dynamic in their time ranges. This is a great improvement because it allows you to adjust your charts to show data from any particular point in time, which is useful for tying data to business outcomes. The Platform API components offer a lot more functionality, too, including the ability to navigate the user to another place in New Relic. You'll learn how to do this in the next lesson.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add a new configuration option Step 1 of 8 In your visualization's nr1.json file, add an enum configuration object for selectedChart: index.js nr1.json 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 Radar: 'radar', 24 Treemap: 'treemap', 25 }; 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application.

Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another. Step 4 of 4 In index.js, change your component's Radar.fillOpacity: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 } from 'recharts'; 10 import {Card, CardBody, HeadingText, NrqlQuery, Spinner, AutoSizer} from 'nr1'; 11 12 export default class MyAwesomeVisualizationVisualization extends React.Component { 13 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 14 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization! In this guide, you learned how to: Create a visualization Serve your visualization locally Iterate on visualization code changes and customizations in Custom Visualizations Publish your visualization Subscribe to your visualization Add your visualization to a dashboard Additional resources New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes)",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Before you begin Explore our custom visualization guides and build your first visualization. After you're done, you'll have a better foundation for building more complex visualizations, such as the one you'll build in this course. Finally, if you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create your visualization Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called radar-or-treemap, in a Nerdpack, called alternate-viz: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name radar-or-treemap ✔ You’re trying to create a visualization outside of a Nerdpack. We’ll create a Nerdpack for you—what do you want to name it? … alternate-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack alternate-viz is available at \"./alternate-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization radar-or-treemap is available at \"./alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/radar-or-treemap directory under alternate-viz: bash Copy $ cd alternate-viz $ ls visualizations/radar-or-treemap index.js nr1.json styles.scss Set up your component state Add component state to the default visualization template that nr1 created for you.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type. Use SegmentedControl and SegmentedControlItem to switch between the two chart types. Tip To learn more about the components available in the New Relic One SDK, go to our Intro to New Relic One SDK.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One Apps overlay. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

      "body": "Serve your Nerdpack locally when it's still in development and you're not ready to share it with others. You'll use your own machine's resources, but you'll see the Nerdpack in the New Relic platform as you would if it were published. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Serve your Nerdpack locally Step 1 of 5 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run the nerdpack:serve command: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve If you've successfully served your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! While your Nerdpack is being served locally, the server will automatically reload your Nerdpack when it detects that you've modified a file. This doesn't include the metadata file nr1.json or the styles file styles.css. If you update those files, you need to stop your local server with CTRL+C and restart it with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 5 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local: New Relic requires the ?nerdpacks=local query string to load locally served Nerdpacks. Step 3 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Whether you're creating a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Apps. Step 4 of 5 If you're serving a Nerdpack with a launcher and a Nerdlet, you'll find your local app under Your apps: If you're serving a Nerdpack with a visualization, go to Favorite apps > Custom Visualizations: Tip If Custom Visualizations isn't favorited, you can find it under Your apps. From Custom Visualizations, you'll see your visualization: Whether you're serving a Nerdpack for an app or a visualization, you'll see a </> Local indicator on its UI tile. Use this to distinguish between published Nerdpacks and locally served Nerdpacks. Step 5 of 5 When you're ready to stop serving your Nerdpack locally, type CTRL+C into your terminal where the server is running. Resolve issues with accessing your local Nerdpack Sometimes, when you serve your Nerdpack locally, you may come across issues. You may be unable to serve your Nerdpack because of bugs in your code. Or, you may successfully serve your Nerdpack but be unable to find it in New Relic. Consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your application When you attempt to serve your Nerdpack locally, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve --verbose Show locally served Nerdpacks If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, make sure you're using the ?nerdpacks=local query string. If you're not, New Relic won't load your locally served Nerdpack on the platform. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you serve your Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:serve, you must be signed into the same profile in New Relic that you're serving with locally. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic and you're using the correct query string, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same. Access your proxy browser Generally, you don't need to know how your application code is loaded in New Relic. But understanding how it works can help you resolve issues with your local server. When you run nr1 nerdpack:serve, your code is served by your local machine using an nr-local.net subdomain. This domain points to 127.0.0.1, and uses a variety of ports to connect, including 9973. To load a Nerdpack into the platform, whether it's locally served or published to the Instant Observability catalog, New Relic uses an <IFRAME> and a separate domain (a subdomain of nr-ext.net), relying on same-domain policy to sandbox the code. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, you're using the correct query string, and you're using the correct profile, your network administrator may need to enable access to: Any subdomain of nr-local.net, or, at the very least, to any domain of the shape of <UserId>.nr-local.net, where <UserId> is a 32-hexadecimal character identifier that is unique to the user logged into the platform. You can use [0-9a-f]{32} to discriminate it. Any subdomain of nr-ext.net, or, at the very least, to any domain in the shape of <NerdpackUuid>.g <NerdpackGid>.nr-ext.net, where <NerdpackUuid> is the UUID assigned to your package, and <NerdpackGid> is zero, or a positive integer. You can use 0|[1-9]\\d+ to discriminate it. Further reading Read the nr1 nerdpack:serve documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve --help",

Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions To subscribe to a Nerdpack, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can subscribe to them: Publish your Nerdpack Tag your Nerdpack if it's published and doesn't yet have a tag Subscribe to a Nerdpack Subscribe to a published Nerdpack, with either the web UI or the nr1 CLI, to use it in your account. Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Instant Observability: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack using the apps filter or search bar: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the Instant Observability catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel. Tip nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:unset. Read the nr1 subscription:unset documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:unset --help Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you subscribe to a Nerdpack, you may run into issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

      "body": "Most Nerdpacks in the Instant Observability catalog are open-source. This means you can clone or fork their repositories, customize them to suit your specific needs, and re-publish them to use with your account. In this guide, you customize a Nerdpack with visualizations and publish it to your account. However, to customize any Nerdpack, you follow the same steps. Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the first four steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI View a Nerdpack Subscribe to the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack and open the Circular progress bar visualization in New Relic. Step 1 of 6 From your homepage at New Relic, navigate to Instant Observability: Step 2 of 6 Click the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack in the catalog: Step 3 of 6 Add Victory Charts Visualizations to your account: Step 4 of 6 From Apps, open Custom visualizations: From the list of visualizations in Custom visualizations click Circular progress bar, which you installed as part of the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack. Step 5 of 6 Under Configure visualization properties, select your account and enter a NRQL query: Now you see a circular chart that shows a percentage based on your query. Tip Read our documentation for instructions on how to configure the progress bar visualization. Notice a few things about this visualization: You don't control the color of the chart The sections of the chart have rounded edges For the sake of this tutorial, imagine this chart represents your data exactly how you want it to, except for two things. You'd like to use straight edges and control the chart's colors manually. In the real world you may come across Nerdpacks like this where you like what they offer, but you'd like them better if you could tweak them. Well, you can tweak them, and next, you'll learn how! Step 6 of 6 Because you're going to use a tweaked version of the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack instead of the one you subscribed to, you can unsubscribe from our version now. Clone a Nerdpack Find the source code repository from the Nerdpack's catalog entry and clone it to your local machine. Step 1 of 5 From your homepage at New Relic, navigate to Instant Observability: Step 2 of 5 Click the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack in the catalog: Step 3 of 5 Go to the Nerdpack's source code repository: All open-source Nerdpacks in the catalog have links to their source code in their catalog information. Step 4 of 5 Clone the repository: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:clone -r https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-victory-visualizations.git Now you have a local version of the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack! Notice that you used nr1 nerdpack:clone instead of git clone to copy the repo. nr1 nerdpack:clone offers built-in functionality to help keep your local copy distinct from the original Nerdpack in the Instant Observability public catalog. Specifically, it generates a new Nerdpack UUID so you don't have to do this yourself: bash Copy Re-generating UUID... Committing new UUID... If you change to the nr1-victory-visualizations directory, and look at the git log, you'll see the new commit: bash Copy $ git log -1 -p commit e356bb5b10c3ecc8f93bae66d5739e1676ee21ef (HEAD -> main) Author: New Relic CLI <nr1@newrelic.com> Date: Tue May 25 14:29:37 2021 -0400 \"chore: Auto-generated UUID\" diff --git a/nr1.json b/nr1.json index 054de52..7a107b5 100644 --- a/nr1.json +++ b/nr1.json @@ -1,6 +1,6 @@ { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", - \"id\": \"cf5f13d9-815f-4907-a21d-83d02fa2a4fb\", + \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"Victory charts visualizations\", \"description\": \"Visualizations built on top of Victory charts\" } Step 5 of 5 In nr1-victory-visualizations/nr1.json, change your Nerdpack's displayName: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"269055dd-67e8-4713-8da3-bff01c6a8687\", \"displayName\": \"My custom Victory Charts visualizations\", \"description\": \"Visualizations built on top of Victory charts\" } nr1-victory-visualizations/nr1.json Copy Now when you serve or publish your custom Nerdpack, you can easily distinguish it from the original. Customize a Nerdpack Tweak the Circular progress bar visualization to use straight edges and customizable colors. Circular progress bar renders a VictoryPie with some predefined fields. The fields you'll tweak are: colorScale cornerRadius Step 1 of 8 In your local Nerdpack, open nr1-victory-visualizations/visualizations/circular-progress-bar/nr1.json. nr1.json is the Circular progress bar visualization's metadata file. Use this file to add a configurable colorScale option, which corresponds to the colorScale field on VictoryPie.

While your local server is running, it automatically recognizes changes to index.js. So, view your visualization in your browser to see the update: Perfect! You cloned and updated the open-source Circular progress bar visualization from the Instant Observability catalog. The only thing left to do is publish your version to the catalog so your accounts can subscribe to it. Step 8 of 8 Now that you're ready to publish your Nerdpack, stop your local server with CTRL+C. Add a custom visualization to a dashboard Publish your version of the Victory charts Nerdpack to the catalog. Then subscribe to it and use your visualization in a dashboard. Tip Because you used nr1 clone to clone the Nerdpack's repository, your local copy already has its own UUID. This is a prerequisite for publishing your version to the Instant Observability catalog. If you used git clone to copy, you need to update the Nerdpack's UUID manually: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The new generated id is ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Step 1 of 6 From its root directory, publish your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 6 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Here, you subscribed to your Nerdpack with the CLI. This is effectively the same action you performed earlier in this guide within the web UI, but from your terminal. Step 3 of 6 Go to the Apps view in New Relic: Step 4 of 6 From Apps, open Custom visualizations: From here, click the Circular progress bar visualization. Update your visualization's configuration options like you did when you were serving your Nerdpack locally. Step 5 of 6 Click Add to dashboard: Step 6 of 6 Go to your dashboard and see your new, customized circular progress bar: Summary In this guide, you: Subscribed to a Nerdpack from the Instant Observability catalog Cloned an open-source Nerdpack Edited an existing visualization to meet your needs Published and subscribed to your own custom Nerdpack Added a visualization from your custom Nerdpack to a dashboard Now you know how to build off the foundation of open-source Nerdpacks, you can use the work of the New Relic developer community to fast-track the creation of apps and visualizations. Tip If you want to maintain your own version in a remote repository, consider forking the original repo.",

      "body": "Publish your Nerdpack, whether it's still in development, ready for testing, or stable, to share it with others. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions When you publish your Nerdpack, it's registered with the Instant Observability catalog. From there, some users can subscribe to your Nerdpack. Subscribing users need to have: Access to the account that published the Nerdpack The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Update your package version You can only publish a package version to the Instant Observabiltiy catalog one time. For example, you can't publish two instances of version 1.0.0. So, each time you want to deploy a new version of your code, you need to increment its version in the Nerdpack's package.json file: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy Tip Nerdpack versions follow semantic versioning. Read the documentation to learn more. Generate a UUID for your Nerdpack If you built your Nerdpack from scratch with nr1 create --type nerdpack, then your Nerdpack has a unique identifier. Find this identifier in the root directory's nr1.json file: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"DemoApp\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack demo-app\" } nr1.json Copy This ID must be unique to your Nerdpack when you publish it to the catalog. The platform will reject your Nerdpack if it recognizes the ID. So, if you cloned an existing Nerdpack or are otherwise using open source code, generate a new UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --generate --force Tip Read the nr1 nerdpack:uuid documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --help Publish your Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish If you've successfully published your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This output describes the published Nerdpack. First, it states the Nerdpack's ID (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890). Then, its version (1.0.0). Finally, its version tag (STABLE). You already managed your Nerdpack's ID and version, but the version tag is new. To manage your Nerdpack's versions, you can tag them with an arbitrary tag. For example, if a version is still in development, you can tag it with a DEV tag. If the version moves to a QA phase, you can tag it with QA. If it's ready for production, you can tag it with STABLE. Tip Read our tag guide to learn more. Use the -t or --tag option to publish your Nerdpack with a tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag DEV As you saw in the nr1 nerdpack:publish output, if you don't pass a tag, nr1 applies the STABLE tag automatically. However, you can tell it to not apply any tags to a release with the -T or --skip-tag option: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --skip-tag You can also perform a dry run to make sure you publish your Nerdpack the way you want to: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --dry-run Step 2 of 4 Once you've successfully published your Nerdpack, go to New Relic: Because you're going to view a published Nerdpack, rather than a locally served one, you don't need to pass the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to Instant Observability: Whether you published a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Instant Observability. Step 4 of 4 Find your published Nerdpack using the Apps filter or search bar: Notice the Custom indicator on its UI tile. Use this to distinguish between published Nerdpacks and locally-served Nerdpacks. Tip Only Nerdpacks with tagged versions are shown in Instant Observability. So, if you published without a tag or removed a tag from your published Nerdpack, you won't see it in the catalog. Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you publish your Nerdpack, you may come across issues. Whether you can't publish your Nerdpack due to some issue with your code or you can't find your Nerdpack in Instant Observability, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your command When you attempt to publish your Nerdpack, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. For example: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack DemoApp (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890) › Error: There is already a Nerdpack with given id & version. › Code: 409 It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --verbose Reveal your published Nerdpack information If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, it may not be tagged. Remember, at least one version of your published Nerdpack must have a tag for it to show on the Apps page. See more information about your published Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:info: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 3014918 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 3 hours ago In this example, there is one published version, but it isn't tagged. You can tag a published version with: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --from-version=1.0.0 --tag=DEV Now, if you refresh your browser page, you should see your Nerdpack on Apps. Tip Read our nr1 nerdpack:tag documentation to learn more. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you publish your Nerdpack, only users who can access your account can see your published Nerdpack. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic but you know it's published, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same.",

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another. Step 4 of 4 In index.js, change your component's Radar.fillOpacity: index.js 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 } from 'recharts'; 10 import {Card, CardBody, HeadingText, NrqlQuery, Spinner, AutoSizer} from 'nr1'; 11 12 export default class MyAwesomeVisualizationVisualization extends React.Component { 13 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 14 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the first four steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create and publish your Nerdpack Create a Nerdpack with a visualization. You'll add this visualization to a dashboard using NerdGraph. Further reading Because this guide is about using visualizations, not creating and publishing them, it breezes over these topics. If you're unfamiliar with visualizations or would like a thorough explanation of dealing with visualization Nerdpacks, check out the following resources: Introduction to custom visualizations Build your first custom visualization If you already have a visualization you'd like to add to a dashboard, you can skip this section. But don't forget to make the necessary code adjustments to reference your visualization instead of the one this guide uses, called my-awesome-visualization. Step 1 of 4 Update your nr1 CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Now, you have the latest version. Step 2 of 4 Create a visualization, called my-awesome-visualization, in a Nerdpack, called my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 create -t visualization -n my-awesome-visualization ✔ You’re trying to create a visualization outside of a Nerdpack. We’ll create a Nerdpack for you—what do you want to name it? … my-awesome-nerdpack ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack my-awesome-nerdpack is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization my-awesome-visualization is available at \"./my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization\" When you build a visualization with nr1 create, you get a default visualization. You'll use this default visualization throughout this course. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to your new Nerdpack: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack From here, you can run nr1 nerdpack commands. Step 4 of 4 Publish and subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Now, that your account is subscribed to your visualization, you can describe your app configurations with JSON and add it to a dashboard with NerdGraph. Describe your visualization options with JSON Whether you're adding your visualization to a new dashboard or an existing one, you need to send your configuration to NerdGraph. Your custom visualization JSON object represents a dashboard widget and consists of the following fields: Field Type Description title String Title for your dashboard widget visualization JSON The metadata for your visualization visualization.id String Your visualization's ID rawConfiguration JSON A full configuration of your widget Tip You can also add other types of widgets to dashboards with the steps in this guide, but the fields described here are specific to custom visualization widgets. For other widget types, you need to supply different data. Explore the API on your own with our NerdGraph explorer! Step 1 of 5 Start with a JSON template based on the fields you need to describe your custom visualization: { \"title\": \"\", \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"\" }, \"rawConfiguration\": {} } Copy Step 2 of 5 Give your visualization widget a title: { \"title\": \"My Awesome Visualization\", \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"\" }, \"rawConfiguration\": {} } Copy Step 3 of 5 Look up your Nerdpack ID from my-awesome-nerdpack/nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack my-awesome-nerdpack\" } my-awesome-nerdpack/nr1.json Copy Then, look up your visualization ID from my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"VISUALIZATION\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-visualization\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeVisualization\", \"description\": \"\", \"configuration\": [ { \"name\": \"nrqlQueries\", \"title\": \"NRQL Queries\", \"type\": \"collection\", \"items\": [ { \"name\": \"accountId\", \"title\": \"Account ID\", \"description\": \"Account ID to be associated with the query\", \"type\": \"account-id\" }, { \"name\": \"query\", \"title\": \"Query\", \"description\": \"NRQL query for visualization\", \"type\": \"nrql\" } ] }, { \"name\": \"fill\", \"title\": \"Fill color\", \"description\": \"A fill color to override the default fill color\", \"type\": \"string\" }, { \"name\": \"stroke\", \"title\": \"Stroke color\", \"description\": \"A stroke color to override the default stroke color\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json Copy Set your visualization widget's visualization.id to the form {NERDPACK-ID}.{VISUALIZATION-ID}: { \"title\": \"My Awesome Visualization\", \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, \"rawConfiguration\": {} } Copy Step 4 of 5 In my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json, review your configuration options: { \"schemaType\": \"VISUALIZATION\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-visualization\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeVisualization\", \"description\": \"\", \"configuration\": [ { \"name\": \"nrqlQueries\", \"title\": \"NRQL Queries\", \"type\": \"collection\", \"items\": [ { \"name\": \"accountId\", \"title\": \"Account ID\", \"description\": \"Account ID to be associated with the query\", \"type\": \"account-id\" }, { \"name\": \"query\", \"title\": \"Query\", \"description\": \"NRQL query for visualization\", \"type\": \"nrql\" } ] }, { \"name\": \"fill\", \"title\": \"Fill color\", \"description\": \"A fill color to override the default fill color\", \"type\": \"string\" }, { \"name\": \"stroke\", \"title\": \"Stroke color\", \"description\": \"A stroke color to override the default stroke color\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization/nr1.json Copy The name fields in configuration are important for describing your visualization widget. Step 5 of 5 Using the name field for every configuration object in your visualization's nr1.json file, build a rawConfiguration for your widget: { \"title\": \"My Awesome Visualization\", \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, \"rawConfiguration\": { \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 1234567, \"query\": \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], \"fill\": \"pink\", \"stroke\": \"green\" } } Copy Here, you've created a rawConfiguration by supplying values for each configuration option in nr1.json. Note that nrqlQueries is an array because its type is collection. The other values are strings. Learn more about these configuration options in Configure your custom visualization. Now that you've described your visualization widget in JSON, you can add your configured visualization to a dashboard. In the next section, you'll learn how to create a new dashboard with your visualization. If you already have one ready, skip ahead to add your visualization to your existing dashboard. Create a new dashboard with your visualization If you want to create a new dashboard for your visualization widget, use NerdGraph's dashboardCreate() mutation. The NerdGraph dashboardCreate() mutation takes the following fields: Field Type Description accountId Integer The ID for the account for which you want to create your dashboard dashboard JSON The details of the dashboard you're creating dashboard.name String The name of your dashboard dashboard.permissions Enum: PRIVATE, PUBLIC_READ_ONLY, PUBLIC_READ_WRITE The access control of your dashboard dashboard.pages Array: JSON The details of your dashboard's pages dashboard.pages[].name String The name of the dashboard page dashboard.pages[].widgets Array: JSON The widgets to add to the dashboard page Tip You can also pass more fields to dashboardCreate() to add details, widgets, and more. Explore the API on your own with our NerdGraph explorer! In this guide, you create a dashboard with a single page that contains a single widget—the visualization widget you described in the last section. Step 1 of 5 Build out a GraphQL mutation template based on the fields you need to describe your dashboard in dashboardCreate(): mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 0, dashboard: { name: \"\", pages: [ { name: \"\", widgets: [] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) } Copy Here, you've defined the template for a private dashboard. Now, it's time to fill in the details. Step 2 of 5 Look up your account ID and enter it for your accountId: mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1234567, dashboard: { name: \"\", pages: [ { name: \"\", widgets: [] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) } Copy Step 3 of 5 Select a name for your dashboard and its page: mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1234567, dashboard: { name: \"My Awesome Dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"One Page to Rule Them All\", widgets: [] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) } Copy Step 4 of 5 In widgets, place the widget object you created in the last section: mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1234567, dashboard: { name: \"My Awesome Dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"One Page to Rule Them All\", widgets: [ { title: \"My Awesome Visualization\", visualization: { id: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [ { accountId: 1234567, query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], fill: \"pink\", stroke: \"green\" } } ] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) } Copy Step 5 of 5 Finally, add the return fields to your mutation: mutation { dashboardCreate( accountId: 1234567, dashboard: { name: \"My Awesome Dashboard\", pages: [ { name: \"One Page to Rule Them All\", widgets: [ { title: \"My Awesome Visualization\", visualization: { id: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [ { accountId: 1234567, query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], fill: \"pink\", stroke: \"green\" } } ] }, ], permissions: PRIVATE } ) { entityResult { guid } } } Copy Important Make sure you replace the IDs in your mutation query with ones that match your account, Nerdpack, and visualization. Now, you have a mutation ready to send to NerdGraph to create single-page dashboard with a widget for your custom visualization. As a result, you'll see the new dashboard's entity GUID. In the next section, you'll learn how to add your visualization to an existing dashboard. If that's not relevant to your goals, skip ahead to send your request to NerdGraph. Add your visualization to an existing dashboard To add your visualization widget to an existing dashboard, use NerdGraph's dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() mutation. The NerdGraph dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() mutation takes the following fields: Field Type Description guid String The entity GUID for the dashboard to which you're adding your widgets widgets Array: JSON The widgets to add to the dashboard page Tip You can also pass more fields to dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() to add details, widgets, and more. Explore the API on your own with our NerdGraph explorer! Step 1 of 4 Build out a GraphQL mutation template based on the fields you need to describe your dashboard in dashboardAddWidgetsToPage(): mutation { dashboardAddWidgetsToPage( guid: \"\" widgets: [] ) { errors { description } } } Copy Step 2 of 4 Look up your dashboard's GUID and enter it for guid: mutation { dashboardAddWidgetsToPage( guid: \"AbCdEFghIJkLMNo1PQRSTUVWXYZAbCD2Ef34GHI\" widgets: [] ) { errors { description } } } Copy Step 3 of 4 In widgets, place the widget object you created in Describe your visualization options with JSON: mutation { dashboardAddWidgetsToPage( guid: \"AbCdEFghIJkLMNo1PQRSTUVWXYZAbCD2Ef34GHI\" widgets: [ { visualization: { id: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [ { accountId: 1234567, query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], fill: \"pink\", stroke: \"green\" } }, ] ) } Copy Step 4 of 4 Finally, add the return fields to your mutation: mutation { dashboardAddWidgetsToPage( guid: \"AbCdEFghIJkLMNo1PQRSTUVWXYZAbCD2Ef34GHI\" widgets: [ { visualization: { id: \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\" }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [ { accountId: 1234567, query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" } ], fill: \"pink\", stroke: \"green\" } }, ] ) { errors { description } } } Copy Now, you have a mutation ready to send to NerdGraph to add your custom visualization to an existing dashboard. As a result, you'll see descriptions of any thrown errors to help you debug issues. The last thing you need to do is actually send your request to NerdGraph. Send your request to NerdGraph Send an HTTP request to NerdGraph with the payload you built in previous sections for the mutation that best suits your needs. There are many tools you can use to send an HTTP request, but in this guide, you learn how to communicate with NerdGraph using three specific tools: NerdGraph API explorer cURL New Relic CLI If you use another, you can adapt these methods for your favorite development tool. NerdGraph API explorer The NerdGraph API explorer is an implementation of GraphiQL that lets you explore the NerdGraph APIs. Step 1 of 4 Go to the NerdGraph API explorer. Step 2 of 4 Select or create a new API key: Step 3 of 4 In the center console, paste your mutation query: Important Make sure you replace the IDs in your mutation query with ones that match your account, Nerdpack, and visualization. Step 4 of 4 Press Execute Query and see the results in the right pane: If you successfully created a new dashboard, your response has an entity GUID. If you don't have an entity GUID, the response contains error messages to help you debug your query. If you added your visualization to an existing dashboard, you won't see errors in the response. If you do see error messages, use them to debug your query. Explore The NerdGraph API explorer lets you see other fields and change your query without typing everything manually. Use the left pane to explore NerdGraph. cURL cURL is a command line utility for making HTTP requests. Step 1 of 2 Select or create a New Relic user key. Copy this key, because you use it in the next step. Step 2 of 2 Make a request to NerdGraph, using cURL: bash Copy $ curl https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ > -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ > -H 'API-Key: <YOUR-USER-KEY>' \\ > --data-binary '{\"query\": \"mutation {dashboardCreate(dashboard: {name: \\\"My Awesome Dashboard\\\", pages: [{name: \\\"One Page to Rule Them All\\\", widgets: [{title: \\\"My Awesome Visualization\\\", visualization: {id: \\\"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890.my-awesome-visualization\\\"}, rawConfiguration: {nrqlQueries: [{accountId: 3014918, query: \\\"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\\\"}], fill: \\\"pink\\\", stroke: \\\"green\\\"}}]}], permissions: PRIVATE}, accountId: <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID>) { entityResult { guid }}}\", \"variables\": \"\"}' Important Make sure you replace the IDs in your mutation query with ones that match your account, Nerdpack, and visualization. Here, you send a request to NerdGraph that has two headers, Content-Type and API-Key, and a binary message body containing one of the mutation queries you built in previous sections. If you prefer to use a UI-based client, like Postman, you can adapt this method to a format that your client supports. New Relic CLI The newrelic is a command line interface for reading and writing New Relic data. Step 1 of 2 If you haven't already, install newrelic by following the first two steps of our Get started with the New Relic CLI guide. Once you've done that, you will have newrelic installed and configured for making NerdGraph requests. Step 2 of 2 Make a NerdGraph request using newrelic nerdgraph query: bash Copy $ newrelic nerdgraph query 'mutation { $ dashboardCreate( $ accountId: 1234567, $ dashboard: { $ name: \"My Awesome Dashboard\", $ pages: [ $ { $ name: \"One Page to Rule Them All\", $ widgets: [ $ { $ title: \"My Awesome Visualization\", $ visualization: { $ id: \"de0b4768-1504-4818-a898-da7cd14f0bfb.my-awesome-visualization\" $ }, $ rawConfiguration: { $ nrqlQueries: [ $ { $ accountId: <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID>, $ query: \"FROM NrUsage SELECT sum(usage) FACET metric SINCE 1 week ago\" $ } $ ], $ fill: \"pink\", $ stroke: \"green\" $ } $ } $ ] $ }, $ ], $ permissions: PRIVATE $ } $ ) { $ entityResult { $ guid $ } $ } $ }' Important Make sure you replace the IDs in your mutation query with ones that match your account, Nerdpack, and visualization. View your new dashboard Now that you've built a dashboard with NerdGraph, it's time to check your work! Step 1 of 4 Go to New Relic. Step 2 of 4 Navigate to Dashboards: Step 3 of 4 Select your new dashboard: Step 4 of 4 View your dashboard: The dashboard you created has the name you passed in your mutation, \"My Awesome Dashboard\". It also has the configuration you sent in rawConfiguration, from the NRQL data query to the fill and stroke colors. Summary Congratulations!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One Apps overlay. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

      "body": "Most Nerdpacks in the Instant Observability catalog are open-source. This means you can clone or fork their repositories, customize them to suit your specific needs, and re-publish them to use with your account. In this guide, you customize a Nerdpack with visualizations and publish it to your account. However, to customize any Nerdpack, you follow the same steps. Before you begin If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the first four steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI View a Nerdpack Subscribe to the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack and open the Circular progress bar visualization in New Relic. Step 1 of 6 From your homepage at New Relic, navigate to Instant Observability: Step 2 of 6 Click the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack in the catalog: Step 3 of 6 Add Victory Charts Visualizations to your account: Step 4 of 6 From Apps, open Custom visualizations: From the list of visualizations in Custom visualizations click Circular progress bar, which you installed as part of the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack. Step 5 of 6 Under Configure visualization properties, select your account and enter a NRQL query: Now you see a circular chart that shows a percentage based on your query. Tip Read our documentation for instructions on how to configure the progress bar visualization. Notice a few things about this visualization: You don't control the color of the chart The sections of the chart have rounded edges For the sake of this tutorial, imagine this chart represents your data exactly how you want it to, except for two things. You'd like to use straight edges and control the chart's colors manually. In the real world you may come across Nerdpacks like this where you like what they offer, but you'd like them better if you could tweak them. Well, you can tweak them, and next, you'll learn how! Step 6 of 6 Because you're going to use a tweaked version of the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack instead of the one you subscribed to, you can unsubscribe from our version now. Clone a Nerdpack Find the source code repository from the Nerdpack's catalog entry and clone it to your local machine. Step 1 of 5 From your homepage at New Relic, navigate to Instant Observability: Step 2 of 5 Click the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack in the catalog: Step 3 of 5 Go to the Nerdpack's source code repository: All open-source Nerdpacks in the catalog have links to their source code in their catalog information. Step 4 of 5 Clone the repository: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:clone -r https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-victory-visualizations.git Now you have a local version of the Victory Charts Visualizations Nerdpack! Notice that you used nr1 nerdpack:clone instead of git clone to copy the repo. nr1 nerdpack:clone offers built-in functionality to help keep your local copy distinct from the original Nerdpack in the Instant Observability public catalog. Specifically, it generates a new Nerdpack UUID so you don't have to do this yourself: bash Copy Re-generating UUID... Committing new UUID... If you change to the nr1-victory-visualizations directory, and look at the git log, you'll see the new commit: bash Copy $ git log -1 -p commit e356bb5b10c3ecc8f93bae66d5739e1676ee21ef (HEAD -> main) Author: New Relic CLI <nr1@newrelic.com> Date: Tue May 25 14:29:37 2021 -0400 \"chore: Auto-generated UUID\" diff --git a/nr1.json b/nr1.json index 054de52..7a107b5 100644 --- a/nr1.json +++ b/nr1.json @@ -1,6 +1,6 @@ { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", - \"id\": \"cf5f13d9-815f-4907-a21d-83d02fa2a4fb\", + \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"Victory charts visualizations\", \"description\": \"Visualizations built on top of Victory charts\" } Step 5 of 5 In nr1-victory-visualizations/nr1.json, change your Nerdpack's displayName: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"269055dd-67e8-4713-8da3-bff01c6a8687\", \"displayName\": \"My custom Victory Charts visualizations\", \"description\": \"Visualizations built on top of Victory charts\" } nr1-victory-visualizations/nr1.json Copy Now when you serve or publish your custom Nerdpack, you can easily distinguish it from the original. Customize a Nerdpack Tweak the Circular progress bar visualization to use straight edges and customizable colors. Circular progress bar renders a VictoryPie with some predefined fields. The fields you'll tweak are: colorScale cornerRadius Step 1 of 8 In your local Nerdpack, open nr1-victory-visualizations/visualizations/circular-progress-bar/nr1.json. nr1.json is the Circular progress bar visualization's metadata file. Use this file to add a configurable colorScale option, which corresponds to the colorScale field on VictoryPie.

Then, you set the VictoryPie component's colorScale prop. Finally, you removed VictoryPie.style because the colors are now controlled by colorScale. Step 5 of 8 From your Nerdpack's root directory, run a local server: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Once the server is running, find the url for your local circular-progress-bar: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ circular-progress-bar https://one.nr/04ERPALBYjW ⁎ range-chart https://one.nr/0oqQaxezJj1 ⁎ stacked-bar-chart https://one.nr/0PLRElq3bwa Step 6 of 8 Open your locally served visualization and configure your chart with your account, data query, and segment colors: Tip To add a second color, click the + in the top right of the Colors property. Because there are two segments, you add two colors. The first color is for the progress section. The second color is for the remaining percentage.

While your local server is running, it automatically recognizes changes to index.js. So, view your visualization in your browser to see the update: Perfect! You cloned and updated the open-source Circular progress bar visualization from the Instant Observability catalog. The only thing left to do is publish your version to the catalog so your accounts can subscribe to it. Step 8 of 8 Now that you're ready to publish your Nerdpack, stop your local server with CTRL+C. Add a custom visualization to a dashboard Publish your version of the Victory charts Nerdpack to the catalog. Then subscribe to it and use your visualization in a dashboard. Tip Because you used nr1 clone to clone the Nerdpack's repository, your local copy already has its own UUID. This is a prerequisite for publishing your version to the Instant Observability catalog. If you used git clone to copy, you need to update the Nerdpack's UUID manually: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The new generated id is ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Step 1 of 6 From its root directory, publish your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 6 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Here, you subscribed to your Nerdpack with the CLI. This is effectively the same action you performed earlier in this guide within the web UI, but from your terminal. Step 3 of 6 Go to the Apps view in New Relic: Step 4 of 6 From Apps, open Custom visualizations: From here, click the Circular progress bar visualization. Update your visualization's configuration options like you did when you were serving your Nerdpack locally. Step 5 of 6 Click Add to dashboard: Step 6 of 6 Go to your dashboard and see your new, customized circular progress bar: Summary In this guide, you: Subscribed to a Nerdpack from the Instant Observability catalog Cloned an open-source Nerdpack Edited an existing visualization to meet your needs Published and subscribed to your own custom Nerdpack Added a visualization from your custom Nerdpack to a dashboard Now you know how to build off the foundation of open-source Nerdpacks, you can use the work of the New Relic developer community to fast-track the creation of apps and visualizations. Tip If you want to maintain your own version in a remote repository, consider forking the original repo.",

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application.

Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/my-awesome-visualization directory in my-awesome-nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls my-awesome-nerdpack/visualizations/my-awesome-visualization index.js nr1.json styles.scss The top-level visualizations directory holds all of your Nerdpack's visualizations. The visualization you created is called my-awesome-visualization, and it has its own directory. The files in this directory provide an example visualization—a RadarChart populated by a basic NRQL query. Files nr1.json provides metadata for your visualization. The configuration key in this metadata defines the prop-input fields to be shown in the UI. To learn more about the options available under the configuration key, check out the Configure your custom visualization article. index.js defines the React component that receives the props defined in nr1.json and renders your visualization. You can install and import any JavaScript libraries you find useful. The example component imports Recharts, a library that wraps D3 submodules for easy-to-compose visualizations. styles.scss defines the Sass styles for your visualization Serve your visualization locally Serve your visualization locally, and view it in Apps > Custom Visualizations. There, you can quickly test changes to your code. Step 1 of 4 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, start a local Node server: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack $ nr1 nerdpack:serve While it's running, your local server recognizes changes to certain files, such as index.js and automatically refreshes your visualization. However, it doesn't recognize changes to nr1.json or styles.scss. Therefore, some changes, such as those to the definition of the configuration field in nr1.json, won't be reflected in your visualization until you restart your server. To see changes to those files, stop the server, with CTRL+C, and start it back up with nr1 nerdpack:serve. Step 2 of 4 Open the link to your visualization that's shown in the terminal when the Node server starts: bash Copy Visualizations: ⁎ my-awesome-visualization https://one.nr/012ab3cd4Ef Step 3 of 4 Update the fields under Configure visualization properties, and watch your visualization update automatically: To add more of these properties, update the configuration field in nr1.json, and restart your local server. Configuring these properties is one way to update your visualization. Changing your React code is another.

However, you can't do this with a locally served visualization. You need to publish your visualization, first. Publish and use your visualization To add an instance of your visualization to a dashboard, you first need to publish your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 9 Publish your Nerdpack from its root directory: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Look for a success message in your output: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This means that your Nerdpack was published to the New Relic One catalog that you can find under Apps. Step 2 of 9 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Subscribed account 3014918 to the nerdpack 5f4c2af8-3b27-40b5-954c-356d1ef88dd0 on the STABLE channel. Now, you're subscribed to your Nerdpack and can build an instance of a visualization in New Relic. Step 3 of 9 Once again, open the Apps page at New Relic: Here, you don't need to use the ?nerdpacks=local query string because you're looking for a visualization that you've published and subscribed to, rather than one that is locally served. Step 4 of 9 Go to Custom Visualizations: Step 5 of 9 Find and click your published visualization: You may have to refresh your browser page if you can't find your visualization. Notice that this new tile no longer has a </ > Local label. This is because you're looking at the visualization you published and subscribed to in the previous steps. If you're still serving your Nerdpack locally, you might see two tiles here, one with the label and one without it. Step 6 of 9 Configure your visualization the same way you did when it was locally served: Step 7 of 9 Click Add to dashboard: Follow the prompts to add your visualization to a dashboard. Step 8 of 9 From the homepage, go to Dashboards: Step 9 of 9 Select the dashboard you added your visualization to and see your visualization in it: Summary Congratulations on building your first visualization!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Before you begin Explore our custom visualization guides and build your first visualization.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type.

      "info": "Learn to publish your Nerdpack to Instant Observability",
      "body": "Publish your Nerdpack, whether it's still in development, ready for testing, or stable, to share it with others. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions When you publish your Nerdpack, it's registered with the Instant Observability catalog. From there, some users can subscribe to your Nerdpack. Subscribing users need to have: Access to the account that published the Nerdpack The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Update your package version You can only publish a package version to the Instant Observabiltiy catalog one time. For example, you can't publish two instances of version 1.0.0. So, each time you want to deploy a new version of your code, you need to increment its version in the Nerdpack's package.json file: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy Tip Nerdpack versions follow semantic versioning. Read the documentation to learn more. Generate a UUID for your Nerdpack If you built your Nerdpack from scratch with nr1 create --type nerdpack, then your Nerdpack has a unique identifier. Find this identifier in the root directory's nr1.json file: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"DemoApp\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack demo-app\" } nr1.json Copy This ID must be unique to your Nerdpack when you publish it to the catalog. The platform will reject your Nerdpack if it recognizes the ID. So, if you cloned an existing Nerdpack or are otherwise using open source code, generate a new UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --generate --force Tip Read the nr1 nerdpack:uuid documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --help Publish your Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish If you've successfully published your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This output describes the published Nerdpack. First, it states the Nerdpack's ID (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890). Then, its version (1.0.0). Finally, its version tag (STABLE). You already managed your Nerdpack's ID and version, but the version tag is new. To manage your Nerdpack's versions, you can tag them with an arbitrary tag. For example, if a version is still in development, you can tag it with a DEV tag. If the version moves to a QA phase, you can tag it with QA. If it's ready for production, you can tag it with STABLE. Tip Read our tag guide to learn more. Use the -t or --tag option to publish your Nerdpack with a tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag DEV As you saw in the nr1 nerdpack:publish output, if you don't pass a tag, nr1 applies the STABLE tag automatically. However, you can tell it to not apply any tags to a release with the -T or --skip-tag option: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --skip-tag You can also perform a dry run to make sure you publish your Nerdpack the way you want to: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --dry-run Step 2 of 4 Once you've successfully published your Nerdpack, go to New Relic: Because you're going to view a published Nerdpack, rather than a locally served one, you don't need to pass the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to Instant Observability: Whether you published a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Instant Observability. Step 4 of 4 Find your published Nerdpack using the Apps filter or search bar: Notice the Custom indicator on its UI tile. Use this to distinguish between published Nerdpacks and locally-served Nerdpacks. Tip Only Nerdpacks with tagged versions are shown in Instant Observability. So, if you published without a tag or removed a tag from your published Nerdpack, you won't see it in the catalog. Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you publish your Nerdpack, you may come across issues. Whether you can't publish your Nerdpack due to some issue with your code or you can't find your Nerdpack in Instant Observability, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your command When you attempt to publish your Nerdpack, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. For example: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack DemoApp (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890) › Error: There is already a Nerdpack with given id & version. › Code: 409 It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --verbose Reveal your published Nerdpack information If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, it may not be tagged. Remember, at least one version of your published Nerdpack must have a tag for it to show on the Apps page. See more information about your published Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:info: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 3014918 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 3 hours ago In this example, there is one published version, but it isn't tagged. You can tag a published version with: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --from-version=1.0.0 --tag=DEV Now, if you refresh your browser page, you should see your Nerdpack on Apps. Tip Read our nr1 nerdpack:tag documentation to learn more. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you publish your Nerdpack, only users who can access your account can see your published Nerdpack. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic but you know it's published, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same.",

Step 1 of 7 Update the icon.png in the root of your Nerdpack. This icon is used in the catalog and the Nerdpack's detail page. Step 2 of 7 If you're building a Nerdpack with one or more launchers, update the icon.png in each of your launcher's subfolders. Step 3 of 7 Update your package.json version: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.1\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"f2dbc999-e9a3-49b9-933d-5a704c6750bd\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy This allows you to publish a new version of your Nerdpack.

Consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Publish your Nerdpack Remember that you can only submit catalog metadata for Nerdpacks that have already been published. If you try to submit information for a Nerdpack that hasn't been published, the CLI will try to help: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating DemoApp 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN Resize your images Screenshots for the catalog must meet the criteria specified previously in this guide. If they don't, the CLI will try to help: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots... › Error: 2 errors while updating DemoApp 1.0.1 › › catalog/screenshots/screenshot.png › Invalid Screenshot: screenshot.png has a size ratio of 4:2.

Capabilities at a glance Your ability to manage and use Nerdpacks depends on your user's: Model (original or New Relic One model) Type Role Whether you're on the original user model or the New Relic One user model, review the tables below for a summary of your Nerdpack capabilities. Original user model If your organization was created before July 30, 2020 and you haven't transitioned to our New Relic One pricing model, you're on the original pricing plan. Capabilities for our original user model differ from those of our new user model: Basic user Full user without the Nerdpack Manager add-on role Full user with the Nerdpack Manager add-on role Owner/Admin user Serve Nerdpacks yes yes yes yes Publish Nerdpacks no no yes yes Subscribe to Nerdpacks no no yes yes Tag Nerdpacks no no yes yes Use Nerdlets or visualizations created by your accounts no yes yes yes Use Nerdlets created by New Relic no* yes yes yes Use visualizations created by New Relic no yes yes yes * There are a few Nerdlets that basic users are allowed to use. See Basic users for more information. New Relic One user model If your organization is part of the New Relic One pricing model, the user types, privileges, and capabilities are different than those of our original user model: Basic user Full user Serve Nerdpacks yes yes Publish Nerdpacks no yes Subscribe to Nerdpacks no yes Tag Nerdpacks no yes Use Nerdlets or visualizations created by your accounts no yes Use Nerdlets created by New Relic no* yes Use visualizations created by New Relic no yes * There are a few Nerdlets that basic users are allowed to use. See Basic users for more information. Nerdpack permissions: Original user model Learn the differences between how basic users, full users, and admins can use and manage Nerdpacks in the original user model. Basic users If you're a basic user in the original user model, you're limited in your Nerdpack capabilities. You can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally. To publish, tag, subscribe to, and use your Nerdpacks, an admin must upgrade you to a full user. Tip If you're a basic user, you generally can't use any Nerdpacks. However, there are some Nerdlets that New Relic maintains that you can use. These are rare and there is currently no way for you to distinguish them in our web interface. And even if you can use a Nerdlet in a Nerdpack, you're never able to use custom visualizations. For this, you must be upgraded to a full user. Full users If you're a full user in the original user model, you either: Have the Nerdpack Manager add-on role Don't have the Nerdpack Manager add-on role The Nerdpack Manager role is required to publish, subscribe to, and tag Nerdpacks. So if you don't have the Nerdpack Manager role, you can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally and use Nerdpacks that your accounts have already been subscribed to. To publish, tag, or subscribe to a Nerdpack, an admin must upgrade you to a full user or grant you the Nerdpack Manager add-on role. Owner/Admin users If you're an owner or admin user, you can perform any of the Nerdpack capabilities. You can create, serve, publish, tag, subscribe to, and use any and all Nerdpack items, both Nerdlets and visualizations. This includes Nerdpacks built by New Relic or by one of your accounts. Nerdpack permissions: New Relic One user model Learn the differences between how basic users and full users can use and manage Nerdpacks in the New Relic One user model. Basic users If you're a basic user in the New Relic One user model, you're limited in your Nerdpack capabilities. You can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally. To publish, tag, subscribe to, and use your Nerdpacks, an admin must upgrade you to a full user. Tip If you're a basic user, you generally can't use any Nerdpacks. However, there are some Nerdlets that New Relic maintains that you can use. These are rare and there is currently no way for you to distinguish them in our web interface. And even if you can use a Nerdlet in a Nerdpack, you're never able to use custom visualizations. For this, you must be upgraded to a full user. Full users If you're a full user in the New Relic One user model, you either: Have the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege Don't have the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege The Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege is required to publish, subscribe to, and tag Nerdpacks. So if you don't have the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege, you can only create and serve Nerdpacks locally and use Nerdpacks that your accounts have already been subscribed to. To publish, tag, or subscribe to your Nerdpack, an admin must grant you the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege. Tip The Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege is included in both the User and Admin groups, the only groups available by default. So in most cases, you'll have the ability to manage Nerdpacks as a full user. However, if you're a full user assigned to a custom group that doesn't include the Nerdpacks \"modify\" privilege, you won't be able to manage Nerdpacks. Master/Sub-account Capabilities Some accounts, called master accounts, have sub-accounts that report data back up to them. This organizational hierarchy affects Nerdpack capabilities. In general, the flow of control moves downstream: In this example scenario A, the master account publishes a Nerdpack. This means that all three accounts, Master, Account 1, and Account 2, can subscribe to it. If you subscribe the master account to the Nerdpack, then users of all three accounts can use it. If you subscribe Account 1 to it, only Account 1 users can use it, because neither Master nor Account 2 is downstream in the hierarchy. In scenario B, the sub-account, Account 1, publishes a Nerdpack, so you can't use or subscribe to the Nerdpack from Master or Account 2.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the Instant Observability catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application.

Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Add navigation to your nerdlet, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you finished the A/B test application you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to prepare it for publication. When you publish your app to the New Relic One catalog, users can view it and subscribe to it. You can help your users by showing and telling them what the app does, how to use it, and more. Create catalog information To supply information to the catalog about your app, you need to create the catalog directory in your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 6 Change to the describe-app/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test Step 2 of 6 Create the catalog directories: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog This creates a root catalog directory with template files for inputting custom information about your app and a catalog directory for each Nerdpack item where screenshots can be stored. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the catalog directory. Step 3 of 6 Update catalog/documentation.md: ## Documentation This application combines and presents data from New Relic and the Nerdsletter API so that we can make an informed decision on which design version results in more high-quality newsletter subscriptions. It also presents an button to end the test, which saves the date and version descriptions in local storage. We can use this app for future A/B tests as well! catalog/documentation.md Copy For this course, you're keeping the documentation concise by merely describing what the app does. In your own projects, you might also include instructions for contributing to the project in an open source context, installing the app's dependencies, or anything else that might help a user navigate complexities in your app or code. Step 4 of 6 Update catalog/config.json: { \"tagline\": \"Win @ newsletter subscriptions\", \"details\": \"Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course\", \"whatsNew\": \"Initial release! Includes:\\n- A variety of charts for understanding the test results\\n- An end test button for storing some test data in a table\", \"support\": { \"email\": { \"address\": \"\" }, \"issues\": { \"url\": \"\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"\" } } } catalog/config.json Copy Here, you've specified a tagline, project details, the source code repository, and a short list of everything included in the initial release. In other projects, you might also add a support email or support links. Step 5 of 6 Save the this screenshot to your catalog/screenshots directory. Users will be able to see a carousel of screenshots in your app's About page in the catalog. Step 6 of 6 Save the following icon as icon.png in two places: nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test nru-programmability-course/describe-app/ab-test/launchers/ab-test-launcher This will act as the launcher's icon and the app's catalog icon on the About page. Now you've added documentation, screenshots, metadata, and an icon to your app so that users will be able to understand what it does and why they might need it. For now, these files are all local and they need to be submitted to the catalog. But before you can do that, your app, itself, needs to be published to the catalog. In the next lesson, you'll publish your app, submit your catalog information, and view the results in New Relic.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Install and configure the New Relic One CLI, before starting this one. A Nerdpack is a package that contains all the files that make up a New Relic One application or visualization. Nerdpacks include files for metadata, Nerdlets, assets, and more. To create a Nerdpack, use the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdpack When nr1 prompts for a component name, use \"ab-test\" and watch the tool create the foundations of your Nerdpack. Once it's finished, explore the files it created for you. Root directory At the root level, you have a directory called ab-test. Everything inside this directory is part of the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ ls ab-test README.md nerdlets nr1.json package.json launchers node_modules package-lock.json Readme.md provides instructions for creating Nerdpack elements and serving your application locally. This and nr1 --help are useful if you forget how to interact with your Nerdpack using the command line tool. Javascript files package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules are important for running your JavaScript application, but aren't unique to Nerdpacks. You can learn about these modules from JavaScript courses should you need to tweak them. For now, take a look at nr1.json, one of the most relevant files in this directory. Metadata file nr1.json is the Nerdpack's metadata file, containing a schema type, unique identifier, a display name, and a description. Since you’re building a New Relic One application for running and analyzing A/B tests, update the package's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and set the description to \"A/B test your application using New Relic One\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"311bcd0c-f7eb-4285-afed-4219179bf91d\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"A/B test your application using New Relic One.\" } nr1.json Copy It's good to describe your application's purpose, especially if you're going to publish your application for others to use. Next, look at the launchers and nerdlets subdirectories. Launchers launchers is a directory because you can create multiple launchers for your New Relic One application. nr1 create only created one launcher for your Nerdpack and called it \"ab-test-launcher\". Inside its directory, there are two files: icon.png is an image that represents the application nr1.json is the launcher's metadata file Use \"A/B Test Launcher\" for the launcher's displayName and \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\" for the description in nr1.json: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"ab-test-launcher\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test Launcher\", \"description\": \"Open the A/B test Nerdlet\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\" } launchers/ab-test-launcher/nr1.json Copy Notice that the launcher has a rootNerdletId. This identifies the Nerdlet that the launcher opens when it's selected. This Nerdpack has only one Nerdlet, called ab-test-nerdlet, but some Nerdpacks may have multiple. Make sure that you set the rootNerdletId to the Nerdlet you want the launcher to open. Nerdlets The nerdlets directory contains all the Nerdlets that make up your New Relic One application. Since ab-test-nerdlet is the only Nerdlet in this Nerdpack, there is only one subdirectory. In nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet, there are three files: index.js is the JavaScript file that contains your Nerdlet component styles.scss holds the Sass stylesheet for your Nerdlet nr1.json contains the Nerdlet's metadata Update your Nerdlet's displayName to \"A/B Test\" and description to \"Control and view results of your A/B test\": { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"ab-test-nerdlet\", \"displayName\": \"A/B Test\", \"description\": \"Control and view results of your A/B test\" } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/nr1.json Copy Now, you've customized your Nerdpack, Nerdlet, and launcher with informative display names and descriptions, but what does your application actually do? Check out index.js to see what your default Nerdlet looks like: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, ab-test-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Here, you have AbTestNerdletNerdlet, which nr1 created for you. It's a React component that renders a first-level welcome heading. Because this is the root Nerdlet, as specified in your launcher's nr1.json file, when you click on your launcher in the New Relic platform, the launcher will open a view that displays this heading. Tip In this lesson, you used nr1 create to create a Nerdpack, complete with a launcher and a Nerdlet. If you want to create another Nerdlet or Launcher in your Nerdpack, you can also do that with nr1 create: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type nerdlet $ nr1 create --type launcher You can even skip the --type flag and select an option from a list: bash Copy $ nr1 create ? What kind of component do you want to create? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit. nerdpack ❯ nerdlet - create a/an Nerdlet Nerdpack item inside your Nerdpack. launcher catalog visualization In the next lesson, you'll learn how to serve your Nerdpack locally and see your app in action!

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One Apps overlay. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

      "info": "Build a \"Hello, World!\" app and publish it to New Relic One",
      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog. Next steps Now that you know how to build a New Relic One application, you can read the SDK documentation to learn more about all the components you can use to create apps for your own purposes. Course This lesson is the final part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Congratulations on making it to the end!",

      "body": "Subscribe to a Nerdpack to use it in the New Relic platform. Unsubscribe from Nerdpacks you no longer use. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions To subscribe to a Nerdpack, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can subscribe to them: Publish your Nerdpack Tag your Nerdpack if it's published and doesn't yet have a tag Subscribe to a Nerdpack Subscribe to a published Nerdpack, with either the web UI or the nr1 CLI, to use it in your account. Subscribing allows you to select the tagged version you want to use as well as the account you want to subscribe with. This lets you control what Nerdpacks you use in your account. Tip When the tag you've subscribed to gets an update, New Relic updates your Nerdpack automatically. Step 1 of 7 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 7 Navigate to Instant Observability: Step 3 of 7 Find your published Nerdpack using the apps filter or search bar: All published Nerdpacks are shown in the Instant Observability catalog. However, the one you're looking for maybe filtered out. Adjust the filter to find the Nerdpack you're looking for: Step 4 of 7 Select the Nerdpack you want to add to your New Relic account: Step 5 of 7 Click Add this app: This button says Manage access if you're already subscribed to the Nerdpack. Step 6 of 7 Select the account to subscribe with and the tagged version to subscribe to. Then, update your account(s): Tip In the web UI, and some places in the CLI, we refer to tags as channels. This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel. Tip nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:unset. Read the nr1 subscription:unset documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:unset --help Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you subscribe to a Nerdpack, you may run into issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

      "body": "The Insights Dashboard API is deprecated, but you can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to create and configure dashboards. If you are not migrating from the old Insights API, you can skip this and discover the new Dashboards API. Why a new dashboards API? Our Insights product, which was a way to query data and create charts and dashboards, has been deprecated and its set of features moved over to be a core part of the New Relic One platform. To learn more about this transition and new features, see the Insights to New Relic One migration guide. The Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated in July of 2021. Until then, if you are using Insights Dashboard API, you should attempt to switch over to using NerdGraph. Some details on this deprecation: You can continue to use your Insights insert API key with the Dashboards API, or you can create a new user API key (read more about API keys). Every user who wants to use NerdGraph needs their own user API key. The REST API for Insights queries is not affected by this change and won't be deprecated. For more information about which key to use with our APIs, see our documentation about . When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. Starting out with NerdGraph If you're new to NerdGraph and GraphQL, you may want to first read our Introduction to NerdGraph and some of Create dashboards with NerdGraph. The NerdGraph API explorer is located at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Operations mapping table The table below maps every Insights API operation to the new dashboards API. Insights API operation NerdGraph API query/mutation Notes List (GET) entitySearch() View a paginated list of dashboards that match the filter. Show (GET) entity() View an existing dashboard given its entity guid. Create (POST) dashboardCreate() Create a new dashboard. Update (PUT) dashboardUpdate() Update an existing dashboard given its entity guid. Delete (DELETE) dashboardDelete() Delete an existing dashboard given its entity guid. Dashboard properties mapping table For more information about all the fields in the new dashboards GraphQL schema, have a look at NerdGraph's GraphiQL explorer.

Visualizations mapping table We have simplified our widget visualizations by grouping the ones that were in fact the same but obtained through different types of queries.

By using the NerdGraph API explorer, you can discover GraphQL types and fields, along with a brief explanation. We want to facilitate your migration from the Insights API to the new New Relic One dashboards API. Find below some examples that illustrate how the old REST endpoints map to the new GraphQL queries or mutations. List (GET) -> entitySearch query Dashboards in New Relic One embrace the concept of entity. They are now another entity in New Relic’s entity ecosystem. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. List all dashboard entities you have access to { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by name { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {name: \"My dashboard\"}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s email { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD, tags: {key: \"createdBy\", value: \"email@domain.com\"}}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s user id { actor { entitySearch(query: \"type ='DASHBOARD' and ownerId = '2357322'\") { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy Show (GET) -> entity query In order to get information on a dashboard, all you need is to provide its unique entity identifier or entity guid. Then you can access all the dashboard properties that you are interested in by adding them in the GraphQL query. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Get dashboard info given its entity guid { actor { entity(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { ... on DashboardEntity { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } } Copy Create (POST) -> dashboardCreate mutation Operations that mutate the state of the system are mutations in GraphQL APIs. You can create a dashboard by providing the required input for the dashboardCreate mutation. Although GraphQL APIs aim to be self-explanatory, Nerdgraph docs can help you with some information about the fields, like the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Create dashboard with two pages and two widgets per page mutation { dashboardCreate(accountId: 1, dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.markdown\" }, title: \"My markdown widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { text: \"#My markdown\" } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.billboard\" }, title: \"My billboard widget with thresholds\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" }], thresholds: [{ alertSeverity: WARNING, value: 650 }, { alertSeverity: CRITICAL, value: 1500 }] } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Update (PUT) -> dashboardUpdate mutation The dashboardUpdate mutation allows you to update an existing dashboard by providing the existing dashboard guid and the new configuration. Similarly to creating a dashboard, the mutation tries to be self-explanatory, but you can look up the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Update previously created dashboard to 1 page and 1 widget per page mutation { dashboardUpdate(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\" dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Delete (DELETE) -> dashboardDelete mutation The dashboardDelete mutation allows you to delete an existing dashboard by providing its entity guid. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Delete previously created dashboard mutation { dashboardDelete(guid:\"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { status errors { type description } } } Copy",

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for many of our more curated tools, such as our open source telemetry integrations and our Telemetry SDKs. Data type Description Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing plan) For organizations on our original pricing plan, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API. Plugins New Relic Plugins have been deprecated. For details, see Plugins EOL.",

      "info": "Learn to publish your Nerdpack to Instant Observability",
      "body": "Publish your Nerdpack, whether it's still in development, ready for testing, or stable, to share it with others. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions When you publish your Nerdpack, it's registered with the Instant Observability catalog. From there, some users can subscribe to your Nerdpack. Subscribing users need to have: Access to the account that published the Nerdpack The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Update your package version You can only publish a package version to the Instant Observabiltiy catalog one time. For example, you can't publish two instances of version 1.0.0. So, each time you want to deploy a new version of your code, you need to increment its version in the Nerdpack's package.json file: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy Tip Nerdpack versions follow semantic versioning. Read the documentation to learn more. Generate a UUID for your Nerdpack If you built your Nerdpack from scratch with nr1 create --type nerdpack, then your Nerdpack has a unique identifier. Find this identifier in the root directory's nr1.json file: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"DemoApp\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack demo-app\" } nr1.json Copy This ID must be unique to your Nerdpack when you publish it to the catalog. The platform will reject your Nerdpack if it recognizes the ID. So, if you cloned an existing Nerdpack or are otherwise using open source code, generate a new UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --generate --force Tip Read the nr1 nerdpack:uuid documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --help Publish your Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish If you've successfully published your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This output describes the published Nerdpack. First, it states the Nerdpack's ID (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890). Then, its version (1.0.0). Finally, its version tag (STABLE). You already managed your Nerdpack's ID and version, but the version tag is new. To manage your Nerdpack's versions, you can tag them with an arbitrary tag. For example, if a version is still in development, you can tag it with a DEV tag. If the version moves to a QA phase, you can tag it with QA. If it's ready for production, you can tag it with STABLE. Tip Read our tag guide to learn more. Use the -t or --tag option to publish your Nerdpack with a tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag DEV As you saw in the nr1 nerdpack:publish output, if you don't pass a tag, nr1 applies the STABLE tag automatically. However, you can tell it to not apply any tags to a release with the -T or --skip-tag option: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --skip-tag You can also perform a dry run to make sure you publish your Nerdpack the way you want to: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --dry-run Step 2 of 4 Once you've successfully published your Nerdpack, go to New Relic: Because you're going to view a published Nerdpack, rather than a locally served one, you don't need to pass the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to Instant Observability: Whether you published a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Instant Observability. Step 4 of 4 Find your published Nerdpack using the Apps filter or search bar: Notice the Custom indicator on its UI tile. Use this to distinguish between published Nerdpacks and locally-served Nerdpacks. Tip Only Nerdpacks with tagged versions are shown in Instant Observability. So, if you published without a tag or removed a tag from your published Nerdpack, you won't see it in the catalog. Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you publish your Nerdpack, you may come across issues. Whether you can't publish your Nerdpack due to some issue with your code or you can't find your Nerdpack in Instant Observability, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your command When you attempt to publish your Nerdpack, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. For example: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack DemoApp (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890) › Error: There is already a Nerdpack with given id & version. › Code: 409 It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --verbose Reveal your published Nerdpack information If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, it may not be tagged. Remember, at least one version of your published Nerdpack must have a tag for it to show on the Apps page. See more information about your published Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:info: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 3014918 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 3 hours ago In this example, there is one published version, but it isn't tagged. You can tag a published version with: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --from-version=1.0.0 --tag=DEV Now, if you refresh your browser page, you should see your Nerdpack on Apps. Tip Read our nr1 nerdpack:tag documentation to learn more. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you publish your Nerdpack, only users who can access your account can see your published Nerdpack. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic but you know it's published, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same.",

This is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. Ignoring historical and implementation details, consider them to be synonyms. Now you, and members of the accounts you've subscribed with, can launch the Nerdpack from New Relic. Step 7 of 7 If you subscribed to an app, find it under Your apps: If you subscribed to a visualization, find it under Custom visualizations: Subscribe from the command line If you've published your own Nerdpack, it may be quicker to subscribe to your Nerdpack with the nr1 CLI. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack For simplicity, this guide refers to your Nerdpack as my-awesome-nerdpack. Step 2 of 3 Ensure that your Nerdpack was published and tagged: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 1234567 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------------- ------ 1.0.0 a few seconds ago STABLE You should see at least one published version with a tag. It doesn't have to be STABLE. You can subscribe to any tagged version. Step 3 of 3 Subscribe to your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=STABLE Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the STABLE channel Here, you've subscribed to the STABLE tag. You can also subscribe to DEV and BETA tags from the CLI, but the subscription command doesn't allow for arbitrary tags. To subscribe to any other tagged version, you need to use the web UI. Similar to the web UI, the term channel nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is a reference to an older implementation of Nerdpack versions. Technical detail nr1 nerdpack:subscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:set. Read the nr1 subscription:set documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:set --help Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack Unsubscribe from a Nerdpack to remove it from your account. Step 1 of 5 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 5 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 5 Click the \"i\" icon next to the Nerdpack you're subscribed to: This opens the detail page. Step 4 of 5 Click Manage access: Step 5 of 5 Deselect the accounts you want to unsubscribe with. Then, update those accounts: Unsubscribe using the command line Quickly unsubscribe your CLI profile from Nerdpacks. Step 1 of 3 Navigate to your Nerdpack's root directory: bash Copy $ cd my-awesome-nerdpack Step 2 of 3 View your profile's subscriptions: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:list Listing subscribed deployed nerdpacks on your account: Version UUID Name Date User ------- ------------------------------------ ---------------- ----------- ------- 0.6.4 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Account Maturity a month ago 2774472 Step 3 of 3 Unsubscribe from the Nerdpack with the UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe --nerdpack-id=384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 Unsubscribed account 1234567 from the nerdpack 384de6e5-8e57-4d56-9d13-299ee7ae8641 on the STABLE channel. Tip nr1 nerdpack:unsubscribe is an alias for nr1 subscription:unset. Read the nr1 subscription:unset documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 subscription:unset --help Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you subscribe to a Nerdpack, you may run into issues. Whether you can't subscribe or see duplicate subscriptions in your account, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Tag your Nerdpack version When you subscribe to an Nerdpack, you choose a specific tag. So, if the Nerdpack you're trying to subscribe to isn't tagged, or doesn't have the tag you're targeting, tag your release version: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel DEV. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --tag=DEV ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as DEV. $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=DEV Subscribed account 1234567 to the nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 on the DEV channel. If you subscribe without a --channel argument, the default channel is STABLE, so make sure you have a STABLE version in this case: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe › Error: Nerdpack ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 is not deployed to channel STABLE. You have to deploy it first › Code: PACKAGE_NOT_DEPLOYED Subscribe with the web UI When you subscribe with the CLI, you pass a --channel argument to select a tag. A channel is, for all intents and purposes, a tag. This term is a relic of a past implementation of Nerdpack versioning. However, while the terms are synonymous, using --channel is limited in the CLI. When you subscribe with a --channel, you can only choose between DEV, BETA, and STABLE. So, to subscribe to a different tag, use the web UI: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe --channel=QA › Error: Expected --channel=QA to be one of: DEV, BETA, STABLE › See more help with --help › Code: UNKNOWN",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the Instant Observability catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info AbTest (Nerdpack): description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

AbTestNerdlet (Nerdlet): displayName: AbTestNerdlet supportedEntityTypes.mode: NONE All the information from catalog shows here. Step 3 of 3 View your app in Instant Observability: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application.

Update your Nerdpack's catalog metadata After you've published your Nerdpack to the Instant Observability catalog, update the Nerdpack's metadata to let users know all about your Nerdlets or visualizations. Step 1 of 9 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 9 Navigate to Instant Observability: Step 3 of 9 Find your published Nerdpack using the Apps filter or search bar: Notice that there is no information on the Instant Observability or details page other than the Nerdpack's name and the brief description found in nr1.json: There are no screenshots, icons, details, or what's new features. For these, you need to provide catalog information to your Nerdpack.

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. If you haven't already, check out the course introduction. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the Instant Observability catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info AbTest (Nerdpack): description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

Step 3 of 3 View your app in Instant Observability: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application. Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up. Continue on to the next lesson: Subscribe to your New Relic One application.",

      "info": "Build a \"Hello, World!\" app and publish it to New Relic One",
      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Create a Nerdpack, before starting this one. When you build a New Relic One application, it's valuable to view it on the platform. This helps you design, implement, and debug your application in the environment it will eventually be published to. With nr1, you can launch a development server that hosts your application so that New Relic One can present it to you. Step 1 of 4 From inside the Nerdpack's root directory, serve your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve When the Nerdpack has succeeded building and your application is ready to view, you'll see a message with a link to New Relic One: bash Copy ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! Notice the appended query parameter nerdpacks=local. This query parameter tells New Relic to show locally served Nerdpacks. Tip If you don't see your application on the New Relic platform, make sure you've included nerdpacks=local in your querystring! Step 2 of 4 Navigate to the provided url. From the home page, select Apps to view New Relic One applications: Step 3 of 4 Under the Your apps section, find your launcher, called \"A/B Test Launcher\": Step 4 of 4 Select your launcher to see your root Nerdlet and its default welcome message: Tip Here, you've seen how to access your Nerdlet from a launcher. If you want your Nerdlet closer to your data, you can also attach your Nerdlet to New Relic entities. Congratulations, you've served your first New Relic One application! Notice, in the command's output, that the server reloads when you change files in your Nerdpack. Give it a try by updating nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js: import React from 'react'; export default class AbTestNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>A/B test results</h1>; } } nerdlets/ab-test-nerdlet/index.js Copy Your app automatically refreshes to show the new heading: Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a New Relic One application from the ground up.

      "body": "A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"context\": { \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }] }, \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "info": "Build a \"Hello, World!\" app and publish it to New Relic One",
      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "Publish your Nerdpack, whether it's still in development, ready for testing, or stable, to share it with others. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions When you publish your Nerdpack, it's registered with the Instant Observability catalog. From there, some users can subscribe to your Nerdpack. Subscribing users need to have: Access to the account that published the Nerdpack The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Update your package version You can only publish a package version to the Instant Observabiltiy catalog one time. For example, you can't publish two instances of version 1.0.0. So, each time you want to deploy a new version of your code, you need to increment its version in the Nerdpack's package.json file: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy Tip Nerdpack versions follow semantic versioning. Read the documentation to learn more. Generate a UUID for your Nerdpack If you built your Nerdpack from scratch with nr1 create --type nerdpack, then your Nerdpack has a unique identifier. Find this identifier in the root directory's nr1.json file: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"DemoApp\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack demo-app\" } nr1.json Copy This ID must be unique to your Nerdpack when you publish it to the catalog. The platform will reject your Nerdpack if it recognizes the ID. So, if you cloned an existing Nerdpack or are otherwise using open source code, generate a new UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --generate --force Tip Read the nr1 nerdpack:uuid documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --help Publish your Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish If you've successfully published your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This output describes the published Nerdpack. First, it states the Nerdpack's ID (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890). Then, its version (1.0.0). Finally, its version tag (STABLE). You already managed your Nerdpack's ID and version, but the version tag is new. To manage your Nerdpack's versions, you can tag them with an arbitrary tag. For example, if a version is still in development, you can tag it with a DEV tag. If the version moves to a QA phase, you can tag it with QA. If it's ready for production, you can tag it with STABLE. Tip Read our tag guide to learn more. Use the -t or --tag option to publish your Nerdpack with a tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag DEV As you saw in the nr1 nerdpack:publish output, if you don't pass a tag, nr1 applies the STABLE tag automatically. However, you can tell it to not apply any tags to a release with the -T or --skip-tag option: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --skip-tag You can also perform a dry run to make sure you publish your Nerdpack the way you want to: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --dry-run Step 2 of 4 Once you've successfully published your Nerdpack, go to New Relic: Because you're going to view a published Nerdpack, rather than a locally served one, you don't need to pass the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to Instant Observability: Whether you published a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Instant Observability. Step 4 of 4 Find your published Nerdpack using the Apps filter or search bar: Notice the Custom indicator on its UI tile. Use this to distinguish between published Nerdpacks and locally-served Nerdpacks. Tip Only Nerdpacks with tagged versions are shown in Instant Observability. So, if you published without a tag or removed a tag from your published Nerdpack, you won't see it in the catalog. Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you publish your Nerdpack, you may come across issues. Whether you can't publish your Nerdpack due to some issue with your code or you can't find your Nerdpack in Instant Observability, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your command When you attempt to publish your Nerdpack, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. For example: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack DemoApp (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890) › Error: There is already a Nerdpack with given id & version. › Code: 409 It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --verbose Reveal your published Nerdpack information If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, it may not be tagged. Remember, at least one version of your published Nerdpack must have a tag for it to show on the Apps page. See more information about your published Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:info: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 3014918 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 3 hours ago In this example, there is one published version, but it isn't tagged. You can tag a published version with: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --from-version=1.0.0 --tag=DEV Now, if you refresh your browser page, you should see your Nerdpack on Apps. Tip Read our nr1 nerdpack:tag documentation to learn more. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you publish your Nerdpack, only users who can access your account can see your published Nerdpack. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic but you know it's published, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Describe your app for the catalog, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you created catalog information for the A/B test app you've been building throughout this course. Now, it's time to publish your app to the Instant Observability catalog and submit those catalog details. Versions and tags Publishing an application requires two key pieces of information: version tag An application's version identifies the code it contains and is stored in the Nerdpack's root-level package.json file. Every time you modify code in your Nerdpack and are ready to release it, you'll update the version in package.json. For example, if you fix some bugs in the first major version your application code, you might publish the changes under version 1.0.1. An app version's tags describe its state. For example, version 0.0.1 of a work-in-progress application might be published with a DEV tag to indicate that it's in development. Tip There are some rules governing how you can use tags and you can read about those in our tags documentation. Publish your first application Step 1 of 7 Change to the publish/ab-test directory of the coursework repository: bash Copy $ cd nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test This directory contains the code that we expect your application to have at this point in the course. By navigating to the correct directory at the start of each lesson, you leave your custom code behind, thereby protecting yourself from carrying incorrect code from one lesson to the next. Step 2 of 7 Navigate to the root of your Nerdpack at nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test. Step 3 of 7 Generate your own app UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf The UUID is used to identify your app in the New Relic One app registry. Because you're using code that we developed for this course, an application with the existing UUID already exists in the registry. By generating your own, you're now able to publish this application. Technical detail The UUID also ties your app to your account and, therefore, allows the application to make Nerdgraph requests on behalf of the account that installed it. Step 4 of 7 In package.json, set version to 1.0.0: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"ab-test\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"2d923ba6-d231-4dd3-830f-b1923577a422\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } Copy New Relic One uses semantic versioning and, under this convention, 1.0.0 signals the first major release. Now, you're ready to publish! Step 5 of 7 Replace all instances of <YOUR NEW RELIC ACCOUNT ID> and <YOUR NEW RELIC ENTITY GUID> in your project with your actual New Relic account ID and entity GUID, respectively. Step 6 of 7 Publish your New Relic One application: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish -t DEV That's it! You published your application to New Relic's registry. The -t parameter specifies a tag for your published version. Among other logs, you should see the following confirmation in your console: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack AbTest (9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380) ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as DEV. For now, you've tagged the 1.0.0 release as DEV because it's still a work in progress. Step 7 of 7 View your app's registry information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 4 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 5 minutes ago DEV The results of this command detail the information stored in New Relic's registry for your application, including its UUID, version, and account ID. View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated. You may, however, get an error when submitting this information to the catalog: bash Copy Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating AbTest 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found. Have you run `nr1 nerdpack:publish` yet? › Code: UNKNOWN If you do, try again in a minute or two. It can take a few seconds for the catalog to update with the new version of your application. If that doesn't work, make sure you published your app with nr1 nerdpack:publish. Step 2 of 3 View your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:info AbTest (Nerdpack): description: Nerdpack ab-test details: Display test data for our newsletter subscription A/B test displayName: AbTest icon.url: https://nr3.nr-ext.net/artifact-index-production/a685fec2-29fb-40b0-9f65-4178... previews.0.url: https://application-catalog-production.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nerdpacks/a... releaseDate: 2021-03-12T15:46:09.600138Z repository: https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nru-programmability-course tagline: Win @ newsletter subscriptions version: 1.0.0 whatsNew.changes: Initial release!

Step 3 of 3 View your app in Instant Observability: Notice the tagline on the app's catalog entry. Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use. Technical detail Even though the app is ready for public use, it's still only visible to users of your account. Other accounts can't see apps created by other private accounts unless those apps are added to the public Instant Observability catalog. Now that your app is published and its metadata is submitted, you can subscribe your account to the app from Instant Observability. In the next lesson, you'll learn the ways to subscribe and unsubscribe to your new application.

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Customize visualizations with configuration, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you added a configuration option to your visualization that allows you to choose how you want to represent your data. This was different from the previous version of your code because, while you can still choose your chart type, you can now only do it before you create an instance of your visualization. But what does it mean to create an instance of your visualization? How do you use a visualization once you've configured it? In this lesson, you'll learn how to create an instance of your visualization and add that instance to dashboard. Tip If you got lost in the previous steps and would like to see what your files should look like to start this lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add your custom visualization to a dashboard Step 1 of 7 From the root directory of your Nerdpack, publish and subscribe to your visualization: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish $ nr1 nerdpack:subscribe Important To publish a Nerdpack you must be a Full user with the Nerdpacks “modify” privilege (this is granted by default). Read our Nerdpacks privileges documentation to learn more. Next, find your published visualization in the New Relic One Apps overlay. Step 2 of 7 From the New Relic homepage, select the Apps button in the top right navigation bar: Step 3 of 7 From the Apps page, click the Custom Visualizations launcher: Step 4 of 7 Select RadarOrTreemap: Step 5 of 7 In the previous lesson, you changed your visualization to use the platform configurations panel for selecting a chart type. Use this panel to configure your chart: Step 6 of 7 Click Add to dashboard. Then, select a dashboard from the list of available dashboards, or select New dashboard: If you decide to create a new dashboard, select an account and a name: Click Add to dashboard. Step 7 of 7 Go to your dashboard to see your custom visualization: Note that you can create another version of the visualization with the other chart type and add it to the same dashboard. That's why we call these instances of your visualization. Delete your visualization Once you've added your visualization to a dashboard, you can't edit it. You can't change the underyling query, account ID, chart type, or any other previously configurable option. So, if you're not happy with your visualization, delete it from your dashboard and walk through the steps in this guide again to add a new instance. Step 1 of 2 Click the ellipses button in the right-hand corner of the visualization, and click Delete: Step 2 of 2 Confirm that you want to delete your visualization: Summary Now you know how to: Create new custom visualizations with the New Relic One SDK Configure your visualizations using the SDK and configuration options Add your visualizations to a dashboards To learn more about custom visualizations, check out the following resources: New Relic Quick Tips video: Dashboards and Custom Visualizations (6 minutes) New Relic NerdBytes video: Configuring custom visualizations for dashboards (7 minutes) New Relic Nerdlog live stream: Custom Data Visualizations on New Relic (30 minutes) New Relic One SDK components: Intro to New Relic One SDK Component library Or, to learn more about other cool things you can build with the New Relic One SDK, check out our apps course!

View your application in Instant Observability Now that your application is published and tagged, you can view it in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 1 of 3 Go to New Relic. Notice that you're not using the ?nerdpacks=local querystring parameter. You don't need it anymore because you're not serving your app locally. Step 2 of 3 From the homepage, navigate to Instant Observability: From here, you can see your application among the Instant Observability resources: Notice that this is different than when you locally served your app. Local apps and published apps you're subscribed to show under Your apps in the Apps overlay instead. Step 3 of 3 Click on your app to see more details: Notice the release date and app version. This page should show the information you created in the last lesson. It doesn't yet, because you haven't submitted that information to the catalog, and publishing your app doesn't do that for you. Submit catalog information Even though you've published your application, there are some things that the catalog doesn't know about. These are the descriptions, screenshots, and metadata you created in the last lesson. nr1 catalog is used to submit and view this information. Step 1 of 3 Submit your catalog information: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots from nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test... ✔ Screenshots uploaded from: nru-programmability-course/publish/ab-test ✔ Updated metadata for AbTest 1.0.0 If everything goes right, you should see a success message notifying you that the screenshots and metadata were updated.

Click on the app to see more: Here, you see app details, a documentation tab, release notes, and screenshots. Update your version tag Your app looks great in the Instant Observability catalog, complete with metadata, images, and documentation. Before, you tagged the app as DEV because all of the information wasn't ready for public consumption. Now, it is. It's time to update your version tag. Step 1 of 2 Update your 1.0.0 app version from DEV to STABLE: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag -t STABLE ✔ Tagged 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. Without specifying a version, nr1 uses the version specified in package.json. You can specify a version with the -V command. Learn more about nerdpack:tag with the nr1 nerdpack:tag --help command. Step 2 of 2 View your app information: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: 9da77738-9cf6-43c7-9ba0-e3a8c6ac7380 Region: us Account ID: 123456 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ------------- ------ 1.0.0 30 minutes ago STABLE The app is now tagged with STABLE, indicating it's ready for public use.

      "body": "Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two Nerdpack items: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Tip You will need an icon.png in 2 places for it to be representing properly in Instant Observability, To set a launcher icon place an icon.png file in the the launcher directory. To set the icon for the app details page place an icon in the root directory of the project. Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: bash Copy $ npm start Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to Instant Observability. Instant Observability is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Instant Observability launcher. Step 4 of 4 Click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory in the root directory and any launcher, Nerdlet, or visualization directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 5 of 5 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in Instant Observability, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Advanced configurations If you're interested in advanced configurations for your Nerdpack, read Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it.",

      "body": "Publish your Nerdpack, whether it's still in development, ready for testing, or stable, to share it with others. Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions When you publish your Nerdpack, it's registered with the Instant Observability catalog. From there, some users can subscribe to your Nerdpack. Subscribing users need to have: Access to the account that published the Nerdpack The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Update your package version You can only publish a package version to the Instant Observabiltiy catalog one time. For example, you can't publish two instances of version 1.0.0. So, each time you want to deploy a new version of your code, you need to increment its version in the Nerdpack's package.json file: { \"private\": true, \"name\": \"demo-app\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nr1 nerdpack:serve\", \"test\": \"exit 0\" }, \"nr1\": { \"uuid\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"prop-types\": \"^15.6.2\", \"react\": \"^16.6.3\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.6.3\" }, \"browserslist\": [\"last 2 versions\", \"not ie < 11\", \"not dead\"] } package.json Copy Tip Nerdpack versions follow semantic versioning. Read the documentation to learn more. Generate a UUID for your Nerdpack If you built your Nerdpack from scratch with nr1 create --type nerdpack, then your Nerdpack has a unique identifier. Find this identifier in the root directory's nr1.json file: { \"schemaType\": \"NERDPACK\", \"id\": \"ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890\", \"displayName\": \"DemoApp\", \"description\": \"Nerdpack demo-app\" } nr1.json Copy This ID must be unique to your Nerdpack when you publish it to the catalog. The platform will reject your Nerdpack if it recognizes the ID. So, if you cloned an existing Nerdpack or are otherwise using open source code, generate a new UUID: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --generate --force Tip Read the nr1 nerdpack:uuid documentation to learn more. Or, view the nr1 help page: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid --help Publish your Nerdpack Step 1 of 4 In the root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish If you've successfully published your Nerdpack, you should see some success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. This output describes the published Nerdpack. First, it states the Nerdpack's ID (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890). Then, its version (1.0.0). Finally, its version tag (STABLE). You already managed your Nerdpack's ID and version, but the version tag is new. To manage your Nerdpack's versions, you can tag them with an arbitrary tag. For example, if a version is still in development, you can tag it with a DEV tag. If the version moves to a QA phase, you can tag it with QA. If it's ready for production, you can tag it with STABLE. Tip Read our tag guide to learn more. Use the -t or --tag option to publish your Nerdpack with a tag: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --tag DEV As you saw in the nr1 nerdpack:publish output, if you don't pass a tag, nr1 applies the STABLE tag automatically. However, you can tell it to not apply any tags to a release with the -T or --skip-tag option: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --skip-tag You can also perform a dry run to make sure you publish your Nerdpack the way you want to: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --dry-run Step 2 of 4 Once you've successfully published your Nerdpack, go to New Relic: Because you're going to view a published Nerdpack, rather than a locally served one, you don't need to pass the ?nerdpacks=local query string. Step 3 of 4 Navigate to Instant Observability: Whether you published a New Relic One application or a custom visualization, you'll find your project under Instant Observability. Step 4 of 4 Find your published Nerdpack using the Apps filter or search bar: Notice the Custom indicator on its UI tile. Use this to distinguish between published Nerdpacks and locally-served Nerdpacks. Tip Only Nerdpacks with tagged versions are shown in Instant Observability. So, if you published without a tag or removed a tag from your published Nerdpack, you won't see it in the catalog. Resolve issues with accessing your published Nerdpack Sometimes, when you publish your Nerdpack, you may come across issues. Whether you can't publish your Nerdpack due to some issue with your code or you can't find your Nerdpack in Instant Observability, consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Debug your command When you attempt to publish your Nerdpack, carefully read the output of your nr1 command. You may receive success output, including: bash Copy ✔ Nerdpack published successfully! ✔ Tagged ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 version 1.0.0 as STABLE. However, the output may show some errors in your Nerdpack instead. For example: bash Copy Publishing Nerdpack DemoApp (ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890) › Error: There is already a Nerdpack with given id & version. › Code: 409 It may also help you to view more verbose output. Use the --verbose command to show more content: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --verbose Reveal your published Nerdpack information If you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic, it may not be tagged. Remember, at least one version of your published Nerdpack must have a tag for it to show on the Apps page. See more information about your published Nerdpack with nr1 nerdpack:info: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:info Id: ab123c45-678d-9012-efg3-45hi6jkl7890 Region: us Account ID: 3014918 Local version: 1.0.0 Subscription Model: OWNER_AND_ALLOWED Version Count: 1 Version Date Tags ------- ----------- ---- 1.0.0 3 hours ago In this example, there is one published version, but it isn't tagged. You can tag a published version with: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:tag --from-version=1.0.0 --tag=DEV Now, if you refresh your browser page, you should see your Nerdpack on Apps. Tip Read our nr1 nerdpack:tag documentation to learn more. Check your local profile With nr1, you can set a default New Relic profile. This profile is used for all commands unless otherwise specified with the command's --profile option. When you publish your Nerdpack, only users who can access your account can see your published Nerdpack. So, if you don't find your Nerdpack in New Relic but you know it's published, compare your local profile with the profile you're using in the browser to make sure they're the same.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Publish your New Relic One application, before starting this one. In the last lesson, you published your A/B test app to the Instant Observability catalog. You then submitted your app's description, metadata, documentation, and screenshots. Now, it's time to subscribe your account to the published app. Subscribe to your application Now that your application is published, you can view it by visiting the Instant Observability page of New Relic: From Instant Observability, you can subscribe to applications. Step 1 of 4 From the catalog, click your app: Tip If you don't see your app in the catalog, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. This opens the app's About page and shows the details you submitted to the catalog in the last lesson: Step 2 of 4 At the top left of this page, click Add this app: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 4 From Account access, select the account you want to subscribe to the application and the channel to subscribe to. Finally, select Update 1 account: Here, you only had one version tag to subscribe to. In other projects, you may have other versions with other tags. Technical detail Notice that the web UI uses the term \"channel\" instead of \"tag\". This is a relic of an older version of New Relic One apps. With later versions of nr1, we've moved toward \"tags\" terminology. Eventually, the UI will also use \"tags\". Step 4 of 4 Navigate to the Apps page, and see the AbTest app under Your apps: From there, you can click your app and use it like you did when you were serving it locally! Tip If you don't see the app under Your apps, you may have to refresh the page or clear your browser cache. It's important to note that you can subscribe to applications in the catalog with the nr1 CLI. Read our documentation to learn more. Unsubscribe from your application The process for unsubscribing from an application is similar to that of subscribing. Step 1 of 3 Click the \"i\" icon on your app launcher: Here, you see the same app details you saw when your app was in the Instant Observability catalog. Step 2 of 3 Click Manage access: This opens the Account access view. Step 3 of 3 From Account access, deselect the account you want to unsubscribe from the app, and select Update 1 account: If you navigate back to Apps, you will see your app is no longer under Your apps, but can be found again in the Instant Observability catalog. Throughout this course, you've built a New Relic One application from the ground up. You've used the nr1 CLI to create a Nerdpack, launcher, and Nerdlet. You've used many components from the SDK. You've learned how to publish, tag, subscribe, and unsubscribe to and from apps in the Instant Observability catalog. You've also learned how to submit metadata to the catalog.

      "body": "After you import OpenTelemetry data into New Relic, you can use a variety of tools to analyze it. Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic Explorer tab is a good place to start gathering information about your services. It offers you a way to filter services and then filter the data to show a variety of views into your data. Find your service (entity) To get started in Explorer, you need to find your service: Go to one.newrelic.com. In the left sidebar, click Services - OpenTelemetry: In the center pane, click the service you want to know more about, or find your service by entering the name in the top filter bar. Narrow down your data with filters Once you have your entity, you can then filter for data from your service. With the filter bar Narrow data to..., you can highlight a specific facet of the telemetry recorded for your service. For example, you may want to see the error rate for a particular version of the service that you've deployed in a canary instance, so you add a filter for service.version='1.2.3'. Filters are preserved when navigating between different views of your data for a service. For example, the filter for service.version='1.2.3' carries over to the Transactions view, so that you would see telemetry on requests to the endpoints (transactions) that are running version 1.2.3 of your service, and not any other versions. Filters are preserved when navigating between the Summary, Transactions, Databases, Externals, Errors, and JVMs views. Filters are also preserved when navigating to the Distributed tracing view, but with limitations. Only filter conditions that use the equals operator (\"=\") are currently supported when navigating to Distributed tracing. If you navigate back from the Distributed tracing page, the filters you selected on the previous view will come back. Once you filter your data, the UI has various views in the left-navigation pane. See our descriptions below for view details. Summary page After you click on a service in the Explorer tab, you see the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following: UI area Attribute Response time span.kind = server or consumer Throughput span.kind = server or consumer Error rate span.kind = server or consumer otel.status_code = ERROR Service instances pane service.instance.id (usually set via the OTel resource API) Distributed tracing In Distributed tracing, you can locate traces and examine span details. For your trace data to appear in the New Relic UI, it needs to conform to the OpenTelemetry trace semantic conventions. Also, in the Traces section of our best practices guide, you can find some tips about making sure your traces and spans appear in New Relic. The following attributes are typically not added explicitly to spans. Rather, they are usually set when creating a span or performing operations (for example, recording an error) on a span using the OpenTelemetry SDK. Attribute Description name A span’s name is generally set when starting a span. The name can generally be anything, but the OpenTelemetry specification provides guidance for certain types of spans like Database spans or HTTP spans. span.kind A span’s kind is generally set when starting a span. New Relic uses span.kind to infer that a span is an entry point to a given service. When span.kind = server or consumer it is considered an entry point. When span.kind = client or producer, it is considered a call to an external service or database system. otel.status_code A span’s status is set using the span API. The otel.status_code attribute is how it is manifested by New Relic. The UI primarily uses otel.status_code for the purpose of identifying errors. Find traces and their associated spans Here are some ways to target your searches: To find the traces you want, you can run queries like these in the filter bar: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID When you find an interesting trace, click on it to display a waterfall diagram showing the spans of the trace. Click on specific spans within the trace to display span details in the right panel. Tip For more ways to filter traces, see our distributed tracing UI page. View spans with errors After you click on a span in the trace waterfall view, you can see span errors in the right panel under Error details. The error details are populated by spans containing otel.status_code = ERROR and display the content of otel.status_description. To narrow your search for spans with errors, you can enter otel.status_code = ERROR directly in the distributed tracing filter bar. View span events If you send span events as described by the OpenTelemetry specification, you can view them in the New Relic UI. Span events have two general types: Exceptions Non-exceptions (for example, logs) If you have span events, links for these appear in the right pane: Click on a span in the waterfall view. In the right pane, click View span events, or you can expand Error details and click the link at the bottom of the errors. When you're in span events and only want to view exceptions, slide the toggle Only show exceptions. Tip OpenTelemetry exceptions handled by the app/service are displayed independently of span error status and are not necessarily associated with a span error status. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following: UI area Attribute Top database calls span.kind = client or producer db.system Facets by span name Top databases (by query time) span.kind = client or producer db.system Facets by db.system Top databases (by throughput) span.kind = client or producer db.system Facets by db.system Errors On the Errors page, you can see total errors as well as charts showing error count and error rate. For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following: span.kind = server or consumer otel.status_code = ERROR Facets by span name Externals Externals capture calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following: span.kind = client or producer db.system is not present JVMs When you drill into a specific JVM, the UI display charts driven by JVM metric data: JVM metrics follow the general semantic conventions for runtime environment metrics. The Java specific runtime metrics are not well documented. The implementation is effectively the documentation and may be subject to change. For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following: Requires a unique service.instance.id attribute for rendering the list of JVMs Service.instance.id is an OpenTelemetry resource attribute Logs The Logs page displays logs from your application. For more information about how to associate log data to your application in New Relic, see our OpenTelemetry and logging documentation. For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following: service.name To correlate with trace data, the logs should contain the trace.id and span.id attributes. Metrics explorer For selected OpenTelemetry languages, you can see information about your metrics in this section. Also, if you are using the Prometheus exporter with OpenTelemetry, you can view your metric data here. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time. To get a list of transactions: From the Transaction Summary page, select the transactions table. For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following: UI area Description Top Transactions span.kind = server or consumer Facets by span name Throughput span.kind = server or consumer Facets by span name Data explorer and query builder Explore your metrics and traces using the data explorer, or write your own queries in query builder using NRQL. For more on how to query your data once it's in New Relic, see Query your data and Introduction to NRQL.",

It's free, forever. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can export data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects. New Relic supports all of these signals: traces, metrics, and logs (see details below) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Efficiency OpenTelemetry’s fire-and-forget trace-centric approach to instrumentation often has lower overhead than New Relic agents, especially for asynchronous workloads. It will also result in better handling of trace data for asynchronous requests. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss this with us in our CNCF Slack channel to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start exporting data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our Full Stack Observability customers. New Relic's APM agents In general, New Relic's APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range of configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. New Relic's APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. The following tables show the supported features for each telemetry signal. If you have questions about these or have an unsupported use case, please contact us in our CNCF Slack channel, and watch this page for future updates. Important New Relic's exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of exporting data to New Relic using OTLP. Traces New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of trace signals. The maturity of the upstream specification is stable. OpenTelemetry traces and spans are compatible with New Relic traces and spans. OpenTelemetry spans optionally include attributes (name-value pairs) and resource attributes which map directly to dimensions that can be used to facet or filter span data at query time. OpenTelemetry span metadata (for example, name, kind, and trace_id) also map directly to dimensions on NewRelic spans. At this time, New Relic does not support span links or array attributes. For details, see the Traces section of our best practices guide. Feature Supported Span events ✅ Span linking ❌ Array of primitives (homogeneous) ❌ Metrics New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of metric signals. Note that the maturity of the upstream specification is experimental. We intend to follow potentially breaking upstream changes. Here are the OpenTelemetry data types we support and their associated mappings. For details, see the Metrics section of our best practices guide.

OpenTelemetry log metadata (for example, name, severity_text, and trace_id) also map directly to dimensions on New Relic logs. NewRelic currently supports all OpenTelemetry log message types except for arrays. For more details, see the Logs section of our best practices guide.

      "body": "Here are some best practices based on how OpenTelemetry works with New Relic: Resources Batching Compression Traces Metrics Logs Resources A resource in OpenTelemetry represents information about an entity generating telemetry data. All telemetry data sent to New Relic is expected to be associated with a resource so that it can be linked with the appropriate entity in New Relic. The OpenTelemetry Resource SDK specification defines the functionality implemented by all language SDKs for defining a resource. The following suites of attributes are defined by the OpenTelemetry resource semantic conventions. These attributes are usually set by creating a resource using the OpenTelemetry SDK. service.* attributes service.name attribute is required to associate your resource with an entity in the UI service.instance.id is required for certain panes to light up telemetry.sdk.language=java is required to see data in the JVM section Batching Caution Avoid getting rate limited! You should batch requests sent to the OTLP endpoint as described in this section. By default, the OpenTelemetry SDKs and Collector send one (1) data point per request. Using these defaults, it is likely your account will be rate limited. All OpenTelemetry SDKs and Collectors provide a BatchProcessor, which batches data points in memory. This batching allows requests to be sent with more than one (1) data point. Component Batch Processor Collector Batch Processor Go SDK BatchSpanProcessor JS SDK BatchSpanProcessor Python SDK BatchExportSpanProcessor Compression New Relic supports gzip compression for OTLP payloads exported over gRPC. To maximize the amount of data you can send per request, we recommend enabling compression in all OTLP exporters. If there are other compression formats you'd like to see us support, please let us know in the CNCF Slack channel. Traces Familiarize yourself with these trace topics to ensure your traces and spans appear in New Relic. Required fields The startTimeUnixNano and endTimeUnixNano fields on spans are required according to the OpenTelemetry protocol for trace data. When startTimeUnixNano is not present, the span is dropped and a NrIntegrationError is created. When endTimeUnixNano is not present, the duration of your span is large and negative. The timeUnixNano field on span events is required. When timeUnixNano is not present, the span event is dropped and a NrIntegrationError is created. The traceId and spanId fields on spans are required according to the OpenTelemetry protocol for trace data. When traceId or spanId are not present, the span is dropped and a NrIntegrationError is created. Sampling Trace data is the most mature OpenTelemetry data type. Because of this, New Relic's OpenTelemetry user experience is largely based on trace data and is therefore influenced by your sampling strategy. You can configure sampling in a number of places: Service: Use the OpenTelemetry SDK for your language. Collector: If you're running your own instance of the OpenTelemetry collector, you can configure it to do more sophisticated forms of sampling, such as tail-based sampling (see below). Check out this documentation about how to configure different types of sampling: OpenTelemetry built-in samplers Built-in samplers implemented by the OpenTelemetry SDK for each language. OpenTelemetry tail-based samplers The OpenTelemetry collector has a tail-based sampling processor. We have an example demonstrating the use of the tail-based sampling processor. New Relic tail-based sampling with Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing is New Relic's tail-based sampling option. You can use this in conjunction with your OpenTelemetry instrumented services. In setting up Infinite Tracing, you need to override the default span endpoint and send telemetry data to the New Relic trace observer: Important Currently, Infinite Tracing does not support OTLP ingest. You must run your own instance of the OpenTelemetry Collector and configure it to use the New Relic exporter. Follow the steps in Set up the trace observer to get the value for YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Use the value of YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL to configure your integration. Since you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, make sure to verify that your OpenTelemetry integrations use the AlwaysOn sampler. Metrics OpenTelemetry metrics are largely compatible with New Relic dimensional metrics. We support OpenTelemetry metrics v0.10. All of the supported metric types include an independent set of associated attributes (name-value pairs) which map directly to dimensions you can use to facet or filter metric data at query time. OpenTelemetry metrics are accompanied by a set of resource attributes that identify the originating entity that produced them and map to dimensions for faceting and filtering. The OpenTelemetry data model for metrics defines a number of different metric types: sum, gauge, histogram, and summary. Sum metrics OpenTelemetry sums are a scalar metric that is the sum of all data points over a given time window. Sums have a notion of temporality indicating whether reported values incorporate previous measurements (cumulative temporality) or not (delta temporality). In addition, sums can either be monotonic (only go up or only go down) or non-monotonic (go up and down). Delta sums In New Relic, delta metrics are handled differently depending on whether they are monotonic or non-monotonic: Monotonic delta sums are mapped to the count metric type. Non-monotonic delta sums are mapped to the gauge metric type. Cumulative sums Monotonic and non-monotonic cumulative sums are mapped to the New Relic gauge metric type. Sum configuration examples To understand how to configure aggregation temporality, see these examples using the Java and Go OpenTelemetry SDKs. Gauge metrics OpenTelemetry gauge metric data points represent a sampled value at a given time. These values are converted to the New Relic gauge metric type. OpenTelemetry gauges do not have an aggregation temporality, but the sampled values can be aggregated at query time. Histogram metrics OpenTelemetry histograms compactly represent a population of recorded values along with a total count and sum. Optionally, histograms may include a series of buckets with explicit bounds and a count value for that bucket’s population. OpenTelemetry histograms are converted to New Relic’s distribution metric type, which is backed by a scaled exponential base 2 histogram (see NrSketch for a more thorough explanation). Counts from OpenTelemetry histogram buckets are assigned to New Relic’s distribution metric buckets using linear interpolation. Also, OpenTelemetry has negative and positive infinity bound buckets which we represent in New Relic as zero-width buckets. We do this because we do not have a representation for negative and positive infinity. For example, an OpenTelemetry bucket with bounds [-∞, 10) will be represented by a [10,10) zero width New Relic bucket. You may see exaggerated bucket counts at the endpoints of your distribution due to this translation. Summary metrics OpenTelemetry summary metric data points are used to represent quantile summaries (for example, P99 latency). These map directly to the New Relic summary metric type. Summary metric data points include count, sum, and quantile values, with 0.0 as min and 1.0 as max. OpenTelemetry provides summary metrics for compatibility with other formats. Start time The startTimeUnixNano field is optional according to the OpenTelemetry specification. When this field is provided, it is used for the timestamp on the resulting NewRelic metric, and the duration is calculated as timeUnixNano - startTimeUnixNano. The duration field is used to calculate the queryable endTimeStamp attribute on the New Relic metric, but it serves no other semantic purpose. If startTimeUnixNano is not provided, then timeUnixNano is used for the timestamp field on the resulting NewRelic metric, and the duration field is set to zero. Array values for attributes OpenTelemetry metrics and other signals may include attributes that consist of a homogenous array of primitive types. These attributes are not supported by New Relic. Exemplars OpenTelemetry defines exemplar values that allow other signals, like traces, to be connected to a metric event and provide context. Exemplars are not supported by New Relic. How to query metrics Consider these tips for building metric NRQL queries in New Relic. Query cumulative sums stored as gauges Since cumulative sums are converted to gauges, here are some ways to query your data: Example: Raw gauge value for cumulative sums To view the raw gauge value for cumulative sums, you can use the latest() NRQL function: SELECT latest(totalApiBytesSent) FROM Metric Copy Example: Rate of change with cumulative sums as gauges To see the rate of change over a given time interval for a cumulative sum stored as a gauge, you can use the derivative() NRQL function: SELECT derivative(totalApiBytesSent, 1 minute) FROM Metric Copy New Relic does not currently support either reporting on resets and gaps or accounting for them with cumulative counters. Query gauge metrics When New Relic converts cumulative sums to gauges, you can query them using either the latest() or derivative() NRQL functions. The function you choose depends on whether you want to see the raw value or compute the rate of change. Query histogram metrics New Relic histograms translated from OpenTelemetry metrics have the same query semantics as other New Relic histograms. Namely, the histogram() NRQL function can be used to represent the histogram with a configurable number of buckets and bucket width. Note that you may see larger bucket counts at the endpoint buckets. This is because we are adding negative and positive infinity bound OpenTelemetry buckets into a zero width New Relic bucket. Example: Normal distribution FROM Metric SELECT histogram(test.histogram, buckets: 100, width: 1000) WHERE distributionType = 'Normal Distribution' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Example: Heat map The FACET keyword is also available to create heat map charts. FROM Metric SELECT histogram(test.histogram, buckets: 100, width: 1000) FACET distributionType SINCE 1 day ago Copy Important The TIMESERIES keyword is not supported for New Relic histograms. Logs Logs generated from your applications and environment are an important piece of telemetry. They may represent application logs, machine generated events, or system logs. OpenTelemetry has defined a log data model for representing log data. You can send logs using OpenTelemetry tooling, correlate them with applications, and view them in New Relic. Send logs to New Relic The OpenTelemetry Collector and OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib repositories contain a number of components for consuming log data. The general pattern is to configure the collector to: Receive logs from any of the log receivers. Some of the receiver options include Filelog Receiver, Fluent Forward Receiver, and Syslog Receiver. Process logs, potentially annotating them with resource information. Some of the processor options include Resource Detection Processor and Resource Processor. Export logs to New Relic via the OTLP exporter. Application log correlation Application logs are more useful if they're correlated with other telemetry data produced by the application. The OpenTelemetry semantic convention for services specifies service.name as a required field. All application metric, trace, and log data sent to New Relic with the same service.name are associated with the same entity. The specifics of how logs get annotated with the service.name resource attribute depends on the application's environment: Applications may produce structured JSON logs, which you can configure to include service.name as another field. You can deploy applications alongside a dedicated Collector Agent instance, which you can configure with a Resource Processor to annotate logs with the service.name attribute. Optionally, additional application trace context (sometimes called execution context) can be propagated to log messages. The setup and availability of this depends on the language and logging framework used by the application. The general strategy is to set up the application to write structured JSON logs and to configure it to extract trace context into specified trace context fields on available log messages. The Logs in Context with Log4j2 example in GitHub demonstrates an end-to-end working example for a simple Java application using Log4j2. View OpenTelemetry logs Here are two ways you can view logs: Look in the New Relic Logs UI. If your logs are correlated with an application, view them in the context of the application. The time field The timeUnixNano field is optional according to the OpenTelemetry specification for log data. When timeUnixNano is not present New Relic will use the time that the data was received for the New Relic log timestamp.",

Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Export your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Copy your account license key. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic The OpenTelemetry Protocol, or OTLP for short, is a general purpose telemetry data delivery protocol designed for the OpenTelemetry project. This protocol describes how to encode and transmit telemetry data, which makes it a natural choice for data transport. Each language SDK provides an OTLP exporter you can configure to export data over OTLP. In this step, we focus on how to configure an OTLP exporter in your service to export data directly to New Relic. If you prefer to export your data first to an OpenTelemetry collector, we have separate instructions. Here's an example of sending data from your service directly to New Relic. To complete this third step, first familiarize yourself with some required New Relic settings, and then complete the steps in the OTLP exporter documentation for your language. Review New Relic settings for exports Before you go to the external OTLP exporter documentation, consult the table below so you're ready to do the following: Configure the OTLP exporter to add a header ( api-key ) whose value is your account license key. Based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. Region gRPC HTTP/1.1 Endpoint API Header Name API Header Value TLS encryption required US ✅ ❌ https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License Key ✅ EU ✅ ❌ https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License Key ✅ If you have FedRamp compliance constraints, see FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Important In Node.js, the opentelemetry-collector-grpc library requires additional options to enable TLS. Complete the export configuration steps Click on the link below for your language and complete the configuration steps. When you're done, return here to complete Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Export data to an OpenTelemetry Collector (optional) The OpenTelemetry Collector is a configurable and extensible software component to receive, process, and export telemetry data. When you set up a collector, it can operate as a gateway or as an agent: Gateway: The collector receives data from a variety of sources and applies standard processing before exporting to some backend. Agent: The collector is deployed on each host in an environment and can collect telemetry data about the host and processes running on it. When you use a collector, you start by following the same routine as above for setting up OTLP in your service. In this case, instead of exporting data directly to New Relic, you export through a collector that you set up. In the collector, you configure the OTLP exporter to export data to New Relic. When your data goes through a collector, the transport looks like this: Here's a Docker example of how to set up and run an OpenTelemetry collector with the collector YAML: Save the following as otel-config.yaml: receivers: otlp: protocols: grpc: http: processors: batch: exporters: otlp: endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT} headers: api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY} service: pipelines: traces: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] metrics: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] logs: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] Copy Run the OpenTelemetry collector, making sure you replace OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE with the appropriate endpoint and replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your Account License Key: export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE docker run --rm \\ -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \\ -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -p 4317:4317 \\ -v \"${PWD}/otel-config.yaml\":/otel-config.yaml \\ --config otel-config.yaml \\ --name otelcol \\ otel/opentelemetry-collector Copy Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, watch the New Relic One user interface for your traces, metrics, and logs! The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options or how to make sure your data appears in the UI, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic. What's next?

Manual setup If you prefer to do the setup manually, proceed with the following steps. In your local machine, from a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id In the snmp-base.yaml file, add your network flow devices inside the devices key with the following structure: devices: flowDevice: device_name: edge-router device_ip: 10.10.1.254 flow_only: true # Optional user tags user_tags: owning_team: net_eng environment: production Copy Tip If you're already monitoring SNMP data devices that send network flow data, you don't need to add them in your snmp-base.yaml file a second time. Run ktranslate to listen for network flows by running: Tip Add your New Relic license key and your account ID in the $NR_LICENSE_KEY and $NR_ACCOUNT_ID variables respectively. bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -flow_only=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > nr1.flow $ ## If your account is located in Europe, you need to add the following option before the nr1.flow line $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ Tip This command assumes collection of sflow data. If you are collecting other flow types, you should change the suffix in the --name flag for the container and update the -nf.source argument as necessary To get better visibility into your network device performance, set up SNMP data monitoring.

Linux host prerequisites Docker installed in a Linux host. SSH access to the Docker host, with the ability to launch new containers. SNMP devices prerequisites Configured network devices for SNMP polling from the ktranslate docker container. Some samples of basic SNMP configurations can be found here: Cisco IOS Meraki NX-OS Juniper Junos OS Palo Alto PAN-OS Supported SNMP versions Our NPM container supports all major versions of SNMP (v1, v2c, and v3). Additionally, SNMP v3 has support for the following authentication and privacy settings: Setting Protocol Authentication NoAuth Authentication MD5 Authentication SHA Authentication SHA224 Authentication SHA256 Authentication SHA384 Authentication SHA512 Privacy NoPriv Privacy DES Privacy AES Privacy AES192 Privacy AES256 Privacy AES192C Privacy AES256C Tip We recommend using read-only community strings/authentication with SNMP Set up SNMP data monitoring in New Relic One Go to one.newrelic.com and click Add more data. Scroll down until you see Network performance monitoring and click SNMP. Follow the steps in New Relic One. one.newrelic.com > Add more data > Network performance monitoring > SNMP to set up SNMP data monitoring. To get better visibility into how your network is being used, set up network flow data monitoring. Visualize your network performance data in New Relic. Manual setup If you prefer to do the setup manually, proceed with the following steps. On a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id Edit the snmp-base.yaml file and define the discovery.cidrs and discovery.default_communities attributes to appropriate values for your network. Tip It's recommended to set discovery.add_mibs: true to automate the addition of all discovered MIBs into the global.mibs_enabled attribute Launch a short-lived container to execute discovery by running bash Copy $ docker run -ti --name ktranslate-discovery --rm --net=host \\ > --user `id -u`:`id -g` \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -log_level info \\ > -snmp_discovery=true After the discovery run finishes, you should see an output similar to the following: bash Copy $ >[Info] KTranslate Adding 3 new snmp devices to the config, 0 replaced from 3 $ # In this example, the discovery run found 3 new SNMP devices. The discovered devices are listed in the snmp-base.yaml file's devices.{} section. By default, only the IF-MIB mib is polled. You can manually add other mibs to the global.mibs_enabled attribute if you did not set discovery.add_mibs: true before running the discovery. Run ktranslate to poll target devices by running: Tip Add your New Relic License key and your account ID in the $NR_LICENSE_KEY and $NR_ACCOUNT_ID variables respectively. bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-snmp --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > ## If your account is located in Europe, you need to add the following option: $ ## -nr_region=EU $ nr1.snmp To get better visibility into how your network is being used, set up network flow data monitoring.

This document describes the Enterprise-level HTTP requests page. Non-Enterprise accounts will see the legacy HTTP requests page. Find and use HTTP requests page To view mobile monitoring's HTTP requests page: Go to one.newrelic.com > Mobile > (select an app) > Network > HTTP requests. Use our standard page functions to look for trends in the HTTP analysis charts. Target specific request and response attributes by grouping, sorting, and filtering the data. Understand HTTP request data Here are some places to find the most important HTTP request information: Response time chart The response time chart shows how your app's network calls are performing across percentiles. Use it to compare the average response time to the 1st, 50th, and 99th percentile. Percentiles let you filter out outliers that may be making your average response time higher than expected. HTTP errors and network failures chart This chart shows the unsuccessful network calls your app is experiencing. Select the chart title to go to the HTTP errors page for more detail on the errors and failures. Total requests Sort by Total requests to identify which network requests are being used most frequently. The reason this can be helpful is because your slowest network calls may be only infrequently used, while more frequently used requests might be more worthy of optimization even if they are not the slowest. For a description of the non-Enterprise HTTP requests UI page, see Legacy HTTP requests. Group, sort, and filter HTTP requests If you want to... Do this... Group and sort HTTP requests in different ways Make selections from the Group by and Sort by dropdowns. By default, the HTTP requests page is grouped by request domain and sorted by average response time. Filter for specific HTTP requests Select an HTTP request from the Errors and failures list and/or select multiple filters from the Filter dropdown.

Login. Types of network performance data You can monitor the following types of network performance data: SNMP data: Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an application–layer protocol for exchanging management information between network devices. To send SNMP data to New Relic One, see Set up SNMP data monitoring. Network flow data: It captures information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your on-premises network. To send network flow data to New Relic One, see Set up network flow data monitoring. Important We recommend configuring both SNMP and network flow data for better visibility into your network. This will provide both performance metrics and traffic patterns to troubleshoot and optimize your network.

Before you build a quickstart, you need to spin up a docker container. The container consists of two important services: A python program that mimics the database and also provides functions for create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. It also makes use of newrelic_telemetry_sdk to send telemetry data to New Relic. A simulator service that generates dummy database traffic so you don't have to manually perform CRUD operations To spin up these services, you first need to set NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY environment variable. Prepare your environment On your local machine, set your license key in an environment variable: bash Copy $ export NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY=<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Your mock database uses this key to write telemetry data to New Relic. You can find your New Relic license key in your account settings.

If you haven't already, checkout the lab introduction Each procedure in this lab builds on top of the last one, so make sure you Create a dashboard before proceeding with this one. With New Relic alerts, you can monitor your services and receive notifications about problems that you're interested in, so you can react fast to troubleshoot and resolve them. Tip It is assumed that you are already familiar with the alerts basics. If you're just getting started, visit the alert documentation to familiarize yourself with the basics before proceeding. Create an alert policy Before you set alert conditions, you must create a policy. From Alert & AI, go to the Alerts section and click Policies from left-hand navigation. Then, click New alert policy. Name your policy FlashDB alert policy. Use the default values for the rest of the fields and click Create alert policy. The next step is to add conditions to the alert policy. Create alert conditions You're going to add the following alert conditions: slow read responses low cache hit ratio Create a high response time alert condition Under FlashDB alert policy, click Create a condition. The next page asks you to choose a category for your condition. Choose NRQL, which allows you to create a condition using a NRQL query. Then, click Next, define thresholds. You want New Relic to notify you if the read operation is taking longer than expected. Name your alert condition \"slow read responses\" and enter the following NRQL query for your condition. SELECT average(fdb_read_responses) FROM Metric Copy Here, you selected the average read response for FlashDB. Scroll down on the same page to define threshold. Select Static as the threshold type. It is the simplest threshold type and creates a condition based on the numeric value returned by the query. Set the critical threshold value at 0.9: Here, you defined a condition that will open violation whenever read response time is above 0.9 for at least 5 minutes. Next, click Add warning threshold. Enter the threshold value at 0.8 to get a warning when the read response is above 0.8 for at least 5 minutes. Then, click Save condition. Now, You can see your new condition under your FlashDB alert policy. Create a cache hit ratio condition You claimed that your database is fastest in the space, so you also want New Relic to notify you if your cache hit ratio is too low. Add another condition under the same policy by clicking Add a condition. The next page asks you to choose the category for your condition. Choose NRQL and click Next, define threshold. Enter the name \"Low cache hit ratio\" for your condition and use the following NRQL query. SELECT sum(fdb_cache_hits)/sum(fdb_read_responses) FROM Metric Copy Next, add threshold values for critical violation and warning. The procedure is same as before. The only difference is that you want New Relic to notify you if the query returns a value below 0.85 and open a critical violation if the value falls below 0.75 for at least 5 minutes. Save the condition to add it to your alert policy which now looks like the following. Add a notification channel To receive notifications for any opened violations, you also need to add a notification channel. First, move to the Notification channels tab and click Add notification channels. From the list of channel options, click Email. Select the email you want to receive your notifications on, and click Update policy. Notification channel is now added. Summary During this procedure, you created FlashDB alert policy and added slow read responses and low cache hit ratio conditions to it. You also added a notification channel to receive notifications about any opened violations. Lab This procedure is a part of lab that teaches you how to build a quickstart.

      "body": "Lab This procedure is a part of lab that teaches you how to build quickstart. If you haven't already, checkout the lab introduction As this procedure builds on top of the last ones in the lab, make sure you create a dashboard and alerts before proceeding with this one. With quickstarts, you can quickly and easily observe and monitor your services since they include observability building blocks like dashboards and alerts. You've already created a useful dashboard and alert policy for your database. Now, you can package them into a quickstart and contribute it to New Relic I/O as a benefit to your users. To get started, navigate to GitHub repository of New Relic One quickstarts and fork it. Now, clone your own repository to your local machine using git clone and open it in the IDE of your choice. Notice the directory structure. The _template folder is of special importance since it contains the templates for observability building blocks in the quickstart. The _ template directory contains the folders for dashboards and alerts. Each of these folders contain templates that you can use to create entities for your quickstart. Copy the _ template directory and it's content to a new directory within the quickstarts folder. Name the directory as flashdb. Add your dashboard to the quickstart In a previous procedure, you created a dashboard for monitoring FlashDB. Now, you add it to your quickstart so your users can use it too. First, look up your dashboard in New Relic and copy its JSON. Then, save it as a JSON file in the dashboards directory. Here, you copied your dashboard's JSON to clipboard. Replace the content of existing JSON file in dashboards directory and rename it as flashDB.json. Your flashDB.json file should contain the following content: { \"name\": \"FlashDB\", \"description\": null, \"permissions\": \"PUBLIC_READ_WRITE\", \"pages\": [ { \"name\": \"FlashDB\", \"description\": null, \"widgets\": [ { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.pie\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 1, \"row\": 1, \"height\": 6, \"width\": 8 }, \"title\": \"Database methods\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"facet\": { \"showOtherSeries\": true }, \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 3248695, \"query\": \"SELECT count(*) FROM fdb_method FACET method\" } ] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.billboard\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 9, \"row\": 1, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Database size\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"dataFormatters\": [], \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 3248695, \"query\": \"SELECT latest(fdb_size) FROM Metric\" } ], \"thresholds\": [] }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 9, \"row\": 4, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Average Response Time\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"legend\": { \"enabled\": true }, \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 3248695, \"query\": \"SELECT average(fdb_create_responses), average(fdb_read_responses), average(fdb_update_responses), average(fdb_delete_responses) FROM Metric TIMESERIES\" } ], \"yAxisLeft\": { \"zero\": true } }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 1, \"row\": 7, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Cache hits\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"legend\": { \"enabled\": true }, \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 3248695, \"query\": \"SELECT sum(fdb_cache_hits) FROM Metric TIMESERIES\" } ], \"yAxisLeft\": { \"zero\": true } }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 5, \"row\": 7, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"Errors\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"legend\": { \"enabled\": true }, \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 3248695, \"query\": \"SELECT sum(fdb_create_errors), sum(fdb_read_errors), sum(fdb_update_errors), sum(fdb_delete_errors) FROM Metric TIMESERIES\" } ], \"yAxisLeft\": { \"zero\": true } }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null }, { \"visualization\": { \"id\": \"viz.line\" }, \"layout\": { \"column\": 9, \"row\": 7, \"height\": 3, \"width\": 4 }, \"title\": \"FlashDB Keys\", \"rawConfiguration\": { \"legend\": { \"enabled\": true }, \"nrqlQueries\": [ { \"accountId\": 3248695, \"query\": \"SELECT count(fdb_keys) FROM Metric TIMESERIES\" } ], \"yAxisLeft\": { \"zero\": true } }, \"linkedEntityGuids\": null } ] } ] } Copy Next, create a screenshot of your dashboard and add it to dashboards directory. Give it the same name as your JSON file. Your dashboard directory should look similar to the following: Add your alerts to the quickstart Next, add the static alerts you created previously to the quickstart. The alerts directory contains the templates for static alerts. To help you populate your yaml files, you can use New Relic's Nerdgraph API explorer to get a JSON representation of each alert condition. Tip Nerdgraph is New Relic's GraphQL API. Open the Nerdgraph explorer and select your key from the dropdown menu. Building a query is simple in the explorer. Check the appropriate boxes to build a GraphQL query: { actor { account(id: {_your account id_}) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: \"{_nrql conditions's id_}\") { ... on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { id name nrql { query } } terms { operator priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } } } } } } Copy Tip Under your alert policy, click on the condition to get its ID. Running the above query in Graphql will respond with the details of your alert condition that you can use to update your quickstart. For static condition, take the static-alert.yml file and start populating it using the information returned from above query. First, name the file as read-response.yml and populate it: --- # Name of the alert name: slow read response # Description and details details: |+ This alert is triggered when read operation takes > 0.85. # Type of alert type: STATIC # NRQL query nrql: query: \"SELECT average(fdb_read_responses) FROM Metric\" # Function used to aggregate the NRQL query value(s) for comparison to the terms.threshold (Default: SINGLE_VALUE) valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE # List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition terms: - priority: CRITICAL # Operator used to compare against the threshold. operator: ABOVE # Value that triggers a violation threshold: 0.85 # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600 thresholdDuration: 300 # How many data points must be in violation for the duration thresholdOccurrences: ALL # Adding a Warning threshold is optional - priority: WARNING operator: ABOVE threshold: 0.75 thresholdDuration: 300 thresholdOccurrences: ALL # Duration after which a violation automatically closes # Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day]) violationTimeLimitSeconds: 259200 Copy Here, you added the pre-existing slow read response alert to the quickstart. Follow the same procedure to add the low cache hit ratio alert. For your reference, here's the graphql response. Create your cache-hit-ratio.yml file based on the above response. --- # Name of the alert name: low cache hit ratio # Description and details details: |+ This alert is triggered whenever the cache hit ratio for database is < 0.85. The cache hit ratio can be measured simply by: # of cache hits/ # of total read responses. It represents the proportion of block requests satisfied by the cache without requiring a disk read. A low cache hit score means that the database is inefficient. # Type of alert type: STATIC # NRQL query nrql: query: \"SELECT sum(fdb_cache_hits)/sum(fdb_read_responses) FROM Metric\" # Function used to aggregate the NRQL query value(s) for comparison to the terms.threshold valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE # List of Critical and Warning thresholds for the condition terms: - priority: CRITICAL # Operator used to compare against the threshold. operator: BELOW # Value that triggers a violation threshold: 0.75 # Time in seconds; 120 - 3600 thresholdDuration: 300 # How many data points must be in violation for the duration thresholdOccurrences: ALL # Adding a Warning threshold is optional - priority: WARNING operator: BELOW threshold: 0.85 thresholdDuration: 300 thresholdOccurrences: ALL # Duration after which a violation automatically closes # Time in seconds; 300 - 2592000 (Default: 86400 [1 day]) violationTimeLimitSeconds: 259200 Copy Add a description Your quickstart is almost ready to go live. But how will others know what your quickstart is for and what it can do? To help others understand the purpose of your quickstart, add a description. In the root directory of your pack, you can find a config.yml file. Open the file in your IDE and edit it as follow: # Name of the pack (required) name: flashdb # Description of the pack (required) description: | Flashdb is the fastest database in the space. The Flashdb quickstart allows you to get visibility into the performance of flashdb with the help of following features: Dashboards: - Database methods: Monitor the number of transactions for each database method - Database size: Monitor the size of database - Average response time: Monitor the average response time for each type of database transaction - Cache hits: Monitor the cache hits - Errors: Monitor the errors occured for each type of database transaction - Database keys: Monitor the keys for database Alerts: - Cache hit ratio: Alert is triggered when cache hit ratio falls below the set limit. - Read response: Alert is triggered when read responses are slow and exceeds a set limit summary: | Flashdb is the fastest database in the space. This quickstart allows you to get visibility into the performance of flashdb. # Support level: New Relic | Verified | Community (required) level: Community # Design icon: icon.jpeg logo: logo.png # Authors of the pack (required) authors: - {\"enter your name\"} # References to other packs (optional) # References are grouped by the type: operating-system, database, webserver, queue, .. # The reference under the type is a at least one system, so at least one operating-system, database, .. references: - type: database name: - flashdb Copy Here's how your final flashdb quickstart folder should look like. Contribute quickstart to GitHub Your quickstart is now ready to be published. You're going to commit your changes back to GitHub where it will be reviewed by New Relic. Follow the conventional commit syntax for New Relic to commit your changes. bash Copy $ git add -A $ git commit -m \"feat(flashdb): Added a quickstart for flashdb\" Important We, at New Relic, are always happy to receive contributions from the community.

      "body": "Our APM agents and mobile agents have limits on the number of events that can be reported. This document explains: Why event-reporting limits are necessary How sampling works How to work with and understand sampled data Difference between events and metrics This document is about limits on event data and how those limits lead to sampling. First, it may help you to understand the differences between these two types of data: Metrics: aggregated measurements over time. Examples: average response time over a one-minute time range, throughput over time, CPU utilization over time. Events: discrete events that happen at a specific moment in time. Examples: a log or error being reported, or a configuration change. Some events are aggregated over time to form metrics (for example: a count of errors over time). These two types of data have different uses: metrics are useful for recognizing patterns over time in your system, and events are useful for drilling down and getting detail about the causes of those patterns. Because metrics are aggregated over time, they’re useful for spotting trends and changes in system behavior. For metrics that represent an aggregated count of events (like an HTTP response time metric), the individual events give you granular detail about what happened, and let you facet by attributes that have high cardinality (like account or user ID). Why sampling of events is necessary Our APM agents and mobile agents have limits on how many events can be reported per harvest cycle. This is necessary because if there were no limit, a very large number of events being sent could have performance impacts on your application or on New Relic. When the limit is reached, the agents begin sampling events. Different agents have different limits, but the goal is to give a representative sample from across the harvest cycle. Also, agents may sample if they can't connect to New Relic. When an agent can’t connect to New Relic, it continues to store data locally. But it must restrict the size of the payload that is eventually sent. For this reason, it samples events during the disconnected period. The longer it is disconnected, the more it will sample. The impact of sampling One result of sampling is that there can be a discrepancy between unsampled metric data and sampled event data. Examples of this: An APM chart showing unsampled metric data may show you higher throughput than an equivalent NRQL query of sampled event data. For more about the difference between our metric timeslice data and event data, see Data types. A non-New Relic monitoring service may show different results from New Relic. Events that are capped and subject to sampling include: Transaction TransactionError Span (see Distributed tracing sampling) Custom events reported via agent API (example: the .NET agent's RecordCustomEvent) Mobile MobileRequest MobileCrash MobileHandledException Important For APM, you can compensate for sampling when querying data. Change how sampling occurs Before attempting to change how sampling occurs, please read these caveats and recommendations: Reporting more events will result in the agent using more memory. There will usually be a way for you to get the data you need without raising an agent's event-reporting limit. The payload size limit is 1MB (10^6 bytes) (compressed), so the number of events may still be affected by that limit. To determine if events are being dropped, see the agent log for a 413 HTTP status message. Here are some ways to impact sampling: Most agents have configuration options for changing the limit on sampled transactions (examples: Java agent’s max_samples_stored or the Android mobile agent’s setMaxEventPoolSize). If it’s important to you that a specific app activity not be sampled, you can use the Event API. You could deploy your application across a greater number of instances. Because the limits are per-agent, more agents will mean a larger event reservoir. APM: Compensate for sampling When querying APM-reported events, you can compensate for sampling by using EXTRAPOLATE. This will give you an approximation of what unsampled data looks like.",

With New Relic alerts, you can monitor your services and receive notifications about problems that you're interested in, so you can react fast to troubleshoot and resolve them. Tip It is assumed that you are already familiar with the alerts basics. If you're just getting started, visit the alert documentation to familiarize yourself with the basics before proceeding. Create an alert policy Before you set alert conditions, you must create a policy. From Alert & AI, go to the Alerts section and click Policies from left-hand navigation. Then, click New alert policy. Name your policy FlashDB alert policy. Use the default values for the rest of the fields and click Create alert policy. The next step is to add conditions to the alert policy. Create alert conditions You're going to add the following alert conditions: slow read responses low cache hit ratio Create a high response time alert condition Under FlashDB alert policy, click Create a condition. The next page asks you to choose a category for your condition. Choose NRQL, which allows you to create a condition using a NRQL query. Then, click Next, define thresholds. You want New Relic to notify you if the read operation is taking longer than expected. Name your alert condition \"slow read responses\" and enter the following NRQL query for your condition. SELECT average(fdb_read_responses) FROM Metric Copy Here, you selected the average read response for FlashDB. Scroll down on the same page to define threshold. Select Static as the threshold type. It is the simplest threshold type and creates a condition based on the numeric value returned by the query. Set the critical threshold value at 0.9: Here, you defined a condition that will open violation whenever read response time is above 0.9 for at least 5 minutes. Next, click Add warning threshold. Enter the threshold value at 0.8 to get a warning when the read response is above 0.8 for at least 5 minutes. Then, click Save condition. Now, You can see your new condition under your FlashDB alert policy. Create a cache hit ratio condition You claimed that your database is fastest in the space, so you also want New Relic to notify you if your cache hit ratio is too low. Add another condition under the same policy by clicking Add a condition. The next page asks you to choose the category for your condition. Choose NRQL and click Next, define threshold. Enter the name \"Low cache hit ratio\" for your condition and use the following NRQL query. SELECT sum(fdb_cache_hits)/sum(fdb_read_responses) FROM Metric Copy Next, add threshold values for critical violation and warning. The procedure is same as before. The only difference is that you want New Relic to notify you if the query returns a value below 0.85 and open a critical violation if the value falls below 0.75 for at least 5 minutes. Save the condition to add it to your alert policy which now looks like the following. Add a notification channel To receive notifications for any opened violations, you also need to add a notification channel. First, move to the Notification channels tab and click Add notification channels. From the list of channel options, click Email. Select the email you want to receive your notifications on, and click Update policy. Notification channel is now added. Summary During this procedure, you created FlashDB alert policy and added slow read responses and low cache hit ratio conditions to it. You also added a notification channel to receive notifications about any opened violations. Lab This procedure is a part of lab that teaches you how to build a quickstart.

Now, you want to help users of FlashDB to quickly and easily observe it in New Relic. To achieve your goal, contribute a quickstart to New Relic I/O so other users can quickly monitor FlashDB. Why quickstarts? With New Relic you can collect, monitor, and report data from different sources. You can use dashboards to view, explore, customize, understand, and correlate the data you collect using different user-friendly charts. You can also set alert policies to monitor key performance metrics and receive notifications for anomalies. Traditionally, FlashDB users would have to spend crucial development hours creating dashboards, alerts, and other entities to monitor their database. But with quickstarts, you can do that work for them. Quickstarts provide immediate value for your specific use case. They include: Clear instructions for instrumenting your services Observbility building blocks like dashboards and alerts All of this is available through an open ecosystem where New Relic developers, partners, and customers contribute their best-practice solutions. You, as the developer of FlashDB, are a great candidate to contribute a quickstart to help your users of quickly monitor their instances.

      "body": "Lab This procedure is a part of lab that teaches you how to build a quickstart. If you haven't already, check out the lab introduction. Before you build a quickstart, you need to spin up a docker container. The container consists of two important services: A python program that mimics the database and also provides functions for create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. It also makes use of newrelic_telemetry_sdk to send telemetry data to New Relic. A simulator service that generates dummy database traffic so you don't have to manually perform CRUD operations To spin up these services, you first need to set NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY environment variable. Prepare your environment On your local machine, set your license key in an environment variable: bash Copy $ export NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY=<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> Your mock database uses this key to write telemetry data to New Relic. You can find your New Relic license key in your account settings. Spin up demo services Clone the lab repository from GitHub: bash Copy $ git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/build-a-quickstart-lab.git This repository contains the code for Flashdb as well as the simulator for dummy database traffic. Navigate to the demo directory and execute the following commands to build and run docker image: bash Copy $ docker build -t flashdb . $ docker run -e NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY=$NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY flashdb Here, you build and run docker image that generates mock database traffic. You will observe this data in New Relic. Once the docker image is up and running, you see the following output in your terminal: bash Copy $ docker build -t flashdb . $ docker run -e NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY=$NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY flashdb Writing... try_send Writing... try_send Reading... try_send Reading... try_send Sent metrics successfully! sending event...

Starting out with NerdGraph If you're new to NerdGraph and GraphQL, you may want to first read our Introduction to NerdGraph. If you’re already familiar with the dashboards API, you can read Create dashboards with NerdGraph. When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. Find the NerdGraph API explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Operations We have defined a granular GraphQL API that lets you execute different dashboard operations depending on their goal and scope. Dashboard CRUD operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes actor > entity() query Get dashboard operation. You can get all dashboard and widget data for a given dashboard entity GUID. dashboardCreate() mutation Create dashboard operation. You can create a dashboard attached to a specific account by specifying all its elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardUpdate() mutation Update dashboard operation. You can update an existing dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. You need to specify the complete, updated dashboard elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardDelete() mutation Delete dashboard operation. You can delete an existing dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. This operation executes a logical delete that lets you recover your dashboard. dashboardUndelete() mutation Undelete dashboard operation. You can recover a previously deleted dashboard given a dashboard entity GUID. Dashboard page operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes dashboardUpdatePage() mutation Update dashboard page operation. You can update one page of an existing dashboard given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the complete, updated dashboard page elements, from metadata to widget configuration. dashboardUpdateWidgetsInPage() mutation Update widgets operation. You can update a set of existing widgets of a dashboard page given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the set of widgets to be updated and their complete configuration. dashboardAddWidgetsToPage() mutation Add widgets operation. You can add a set of new widgets to a dashboard page given a dashboard page entity GUID. You need to specify the set of new widgets and their complete configuration. Other operations Operation GraphQL operation type Notes dashboardCreateSnapshotUrl() mutation Create dashboard page snapshot operation. You can create a public URL for a given dashboard page entity GUID. The dashboard page can then be accessed in the form of a static snapshot in the resulting public URL. actor > dashboard > liveUrls() query List all live URLs operation. You can get the complete list of live URLs you have access to. A live URL is a mechanism that allows you to share dashboard pages and widgets publicly with up-to-date or live data. dashboardWidgetRevokeLiveUrl() mutation Revoke widget live URL operation. You can revoke a previously created live URL of a widget. As a result, the live URL will become unavailable to the public. Limits We have limited the values you can set to some of the dashboard properties. This allows us to keep dashboards in good shape while boosting their usability. Dashboard limits Limit Value Maximum number of pages in a dashboard 20 Maximum length of a dashboard name 255 Maximum length of a dashboard description 1024 Dashboard page limits Limit Value Maximum number of widgets in a dashboard page 100 Maximum length of a dashboard page name 255 Maximum length of a dashboard page description 1024 Widget limits Limit Value Maximum length of a widget title 255 Maximum number of entities linked to a widget 1 Maximum number of queries in a widget 20 Maximum layout column of a widget 12 Minimum layout column of a widget 1 Minimum layout row of a widget 1 Maximum layout width of a widget 12 Minimum layout width of a widget 1 Maximum layout height of a widget 32 Minimum layout height of a widget 1 Errors as first class citizens All dashboard mutations offer a way to ask for errors when being executed. This means that you can perform your dashboard mutations and check the response in order to detect expected potential issues. Every error has a type and a description to help you identify what’s the source of the problem. Errors as part of every mutation response mutation { dashboardMutation(guid: \"MY_EXISTING_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { mutationResult { result } errors { description type } } } Copy Keep in mind that these are expected errors that we are aware of in advance. You should also check for unexpected errors that will be returned in the standard GraphQL errors field.",

      "body": "Envision your data as a complex system of roads: you need to navigate the signs and signals along the way to quickly see and make meaning of the information you collect. New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. View dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see Data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. Transitioning from Insights Switching to using New Relic One dashboards from our deprecated Insights dashboards? See our transition guide. If you're using the Insights Dashboard API, we have have a migration guide that will help you transition to using the new API. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By duplicating an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Duplicate a dashboard Duplicate any dashboard by clicking the Duplicate dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can duplicate any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the duplicate will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your duplicated dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can duplicate it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. Everything but the metadata is hidden. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by duplicating another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

      "body": "After you migrate your applications to the cloud and integrate cloud services, use New Relic to measure and validate improvements to your applications. 1. Identify KPIs To provide quantifiable measures that your teams can use to assess your migration, identify a list of corporate KPIs (key performance indicators). Using the New Relic platform to measure KPIs helps you eliminate blind spots and see the connections between entities—from your application code to your cloud infrastructure (including containers running in highly distributed microservices), to your customer experience. Your goal is to create a collection of metrics in several categories that you can visualize in dashboards in New Relic Dashboards. To validate cloud improvements, group KPIs in the following categories, from least to most strong: Application and infrastructure performance End-user experience, including website and mobile application performance Audience and content trends DevOps productivity Application revenue analytics Future business goals 2. Deploy monitoring tools To start monitoring your KPIs, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with the requirements for the New Relic products you want to use. Then, install the New Relic agents: Install APM Review the compatibility and requirements and then install APM agents on your application stack. After installing the APM agents, review the architecture of the applications you instrumented with an APM agent. Take note of all hosts that are part of each tier of the application stack (database, application, web server, etc.), so you can install New Relic Infrastructure agents on each of those hosts. Install infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the infrastructure agent on the hosts that you identified so you can start to gather data for your KPIs. Tip If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. Install infrastructure integrations You can also monitor and report data about services that your code depends on using New Relic integrations. New Relic offers cloud integrations for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform as well as on-host integrations. Tip If you are using AWS as a cloud provider, take advantage of New Relic’s AWS billing integrations to stay on top of your budget and prove the success of your migration. 3. Gather custom data To manage, search for, and filter resources, assign metadata to your cloud resources in the form of tags. Tags are labels that consist of key-value pairs that you use to annotate your Infrastructure data. Tag formats are different between AWS, Azure, and Google. Google, for example, has the shortest allowable lengths for keys and values. In addition, they all have different requirements for case sensitivity and allowable characters. To make sure that your tags are usable across most cloud providers: Use only lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes. Keep keys and values under 63 characters. New Relic reports data contained in specific events to your account as part of its “out-of-the-box” functionality. You can add additional data to those events by using custom attributes. If you determine that you need to collect custom data, review custom data requirements, and report custom event data. For more detailed information about sending custom data, check out these New Relic University tutorials: APM custom data overview Adding custom events using the API 4. Create baselines In order to validate the value of moving to the cloud, you need to get baselines for your applications before you move to the cloud. Define pre-migration baselines for applications and their underlying infrastructures that you have designated for cloud service improvements based on your KPIs. To stay on top of your KPIs as you are moving, create baseline alerts for applications monitored by APM and browser and use NRQL alerts to get notified on any spikes or drops in your KPIs. The following dashboard tracks key performance indicators for applications designated to move to the cloud: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Create dashboards to track your KPIs. After you migrate applications to the cloud, apply the same criteria to post-migration baselines so you can compare your results from before and after your migration. 5. Validate improvements with Dashboards Dashboards is a single location to view all the data that New Relic products gather. Use New Relic Dashboards to visualize your KPIs before and after your move: Transaction and TransactionError event types with APM PageView and PageAction event types with browser Default Infrastructure events and attributes for your systems, processes, events, storage, and network, Infrastructure integrations, and custom attributes Mobile event types with Mobile SyntheticCheck, SyntheticRequest, and SyntheticPrivateMinion event types with Synthetics The following dashboard shows KPI data used to validate cloud improvements: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Create dashboards to track your KPIs pre- and post-migration. Use dashboards to validate the value of adopting a new cloud service and to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier condition types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL conditions produce a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL conditions, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation duration window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple aggregation functions Each condition can only target a single aggregated value. To alert on multiple values simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline condition types. The outlier condition type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy NRQL conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window duration is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period NRQL conditions evaluate data based on how it's aggregated, using aggregation windows from 15 seconds to 15 minutes, in increments of 15 seconds. For best results, we recommend using the event flow or event timer aggregation methods. For the cadence aggregation method, the implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your delay/timer setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window duration, the delay/timer, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert condition types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of conditions: NRQL alert condition types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL condition. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) condition types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. Note that when you have a faceted query, each facet is a signal. So if any one of those signals ends during the duration specified, that will be considered a loss of signal. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, use the advanced signal settings to control streaming alert data and avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window duration Delay/timer Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window duration You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between 15 seconds and 15 minutes, in 15-second increments. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Delay/timer You can adjust the delay/timer to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's behavior. If it takes your data is sparse or inconsistent, you may want to use the event timer aggregation method. For the cadence method, the total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration added to the delay/timer. If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using the event flow method with the default settings. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you use the event timer method. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

If you haven't already, checkout the lab introduction Each procedure in this lab builds on top of the last one, so make sure you Deploy your application before proceeding with this one. With New Relic dashboards, you observe and interpret the data you collect from your application. You gather the data you want to see into charts to customize the way you see it. In this procedure, you create a dashboard in New Relic. Create a dashboard Navigate to New Relic and sign in with your account. Here, you see different tabs such as Browse Data, Dashboards, Alerts & AI. Move to Dashboards and click Create a dashboard in the top right corner. Name your dashboard \"FlashDB\" and click create. Add charts to your dashboard Once the dashboard is in place, you can start creating charts. You're going to add the following charts: Database methods Average response time Errors Database size Cache hits Keys Database methods Hover over the dashboard and click Add a new chart. From this screen, you add charts using our query builder, or you choose to add text, images, or links using Markdown. Click Add a chart. It may open the query builder option. Switch to the NRQL editor and edit the query as follows: SELECT count(*) FROM fdb_method FACET method Copy Click Run to see above results. Here, you see the count of each FlashDB query, grouped by method. You can choose to present your results in different formats such as table, billboard, or pie chart. Change the chart type to pie, name your chart \"Database methods\", and click save. The chart is now visible on your dashboard. You can add more charts to your dashboard following the same pattern. To do so, click + in upper right hand corner. This takes you to the same Add to your dashboard page. Add another chart to your dashboard. Average response time Run the following query to observe the average response time of FlashDB queries. SELECT average(fdb_create_responses), average(fdb_read_responses), average(fdb_update_responses), average(fdb_delete_responses) FROM Metric TIMESERIES Copy Here, you observe the average response time for different FlashDB queries. Click Save to add this chart to your dashboard. Follow the same procedure to add the rest of the charts. Errors For the Errors chart, use the following query: SELECT sum(fdb_create_errors), sum(fdb_read_errors), sum(fdb_update_errors), sum(fdb_delete_errors) FROM Metric TIMESERIES Copy Here, you observe errors for all database queries. Database size Use the following query to get Database size chart. SELECT latest(fdb_size) FROM Metric Copy This chart shows you the database size. Cache hits For the Cache hits chart, use the following query: SELECT sum(fdb_cache_hits) FROM Metric TIMESERIES Copy Here, you observe the total number of cache hits using a line chart. Keys Use the following query to count the number of keys in your database. SELECT count(fdb_keys) FROM Metric TIMESERIES Copy Here, you observe the FlashDB key count. Your final dashboard will look similar to the following: Summary In this procedure, you created a dashboard and added multiple charts to it to observe your services in New Relic.

Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are four options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, IncidentIntelligence, or ProactiveDetection. For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost. This is an estimate of costs to date, not your monthly invoice. For more attributes, see the data dictionary.",

      "body": "Extensive log data can help you troubleshoot issues. But what if an attribute in your log contains thousands of characters? How much of this data can New Relic store? And how can you find useful information in all this data? How blobs work For long string value that are longer than can be stored in NRDB (4,094 characters), we split the storage of the long string into three pieces: The first 4,094 characters are stored in Log event field with the same name So a long message value would have its first 4,094 characters stored in a message field. The next 128,000 UTF-8 bytes of the string are stored in a \"blob\" field with the name with newrelic.ext. prepended So a long message value would have characters past the first 4,094 characters stored in a newrelic.ext.message field as a \"blob\" The actual number of characters stored depends on the UTF-8 representation of the characters. UTF-8 represents Unicode characters as one to four bytes, so we will store anywhere between 32,000 and 128,000 characters past the first 4,094 characters. Any characters past 4,094 characters plus 128,000 bytes are dropped and not stored. So the long message field would be stored as: message: <first 4,094 characters as a string> newrelic.ext.message: <next 128,000 bytes as a 'blob'> Copy Tip You can search the first 4,094 characters of a string attribute. You can also create alerts for the first 4,094 characters. However, since 'blob' storage is not searchable, text beyond the first 4,094 characters is not searchable or alertable. Query your data for blobs To query for any log data in New Relic, run the following query: SELECT * FROM Log Copy To expand the blob data, run the following query, using message or any other attribute. Be sure to enclose the blob's attribute with backticks. For example: SELECT message, another-attribute, blob(`newrelic.ext.message`), blob(`newrelic.ext.another-attribute) FROM Log Copy To query extended blob data in your logs, be sure to include backticks in your attribute's blob syntax. This expands the data in the blob so you can see (but not search) it. For example, New Relic returns: { \"message\": <first 4,094 characters> \"newrelic.ext.message\": <the next 128,000 bytes as Base64> \"another-attribute\": <first 4,094 characters> \"newrelic.ext.another-attribute\": <the next 128,000 bytes as Base64> } Copy The Logs UI automatically stitches the original value back together when looking at the Log Detail View. When querying using NRQL directly, you need to manually stitch the information together by Decoding the Base64 of the newrelic.ext. attribute value Converting the resulting UTF-8 into a string Appending that string to the first 4,094 characters in the \"main\" attribute Data retention for long logs NRDB retains your blob records for a month. If you have existing long log messages stored as LogExtendedRecord, that data will also continue to be available for a month in NRDB. After a month passes, no more new LogExtendedRecord attributes will be created. They will all be stored in NRDB as blobs.",
