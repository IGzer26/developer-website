Easily track the health of your Databricks clusters, fine-tune your Spark jobs for peak performance, and troubleshoot problems with this quickstart.\nDatabricks cluster’s driver node runs each job in scheduled stages. Individual stages are broken down into tasks and distributed across executor nodes. Our New Relic Spark integration collects detailed job and stage metrics so you can get granular insight into job performance at a glance. For example , break down the Job metric by status (successful, pending, or failed) to see in real-time if a high number of jobs are failing, which could indicate a code error or memory issue at the executor level. Metrics on the number of jobs in realtime can also help you make decisions for provisioning clusters in the future.",

    "description": "# Comprehensive Monitoring Quickstart for .NET\n## What is .NET Framework?  .NET Framework is a software product developed by Microsoft. It is a platform used on the Microsoft Windows operating system to build desktop and web applications and supports many programming languages.\n## Why monitor .NET?  .NET monitoring is an essential activity in .NET software development that enables software developers to observe the performance of an application in real-time. .NET monitoring enables a swift intervention if issues arise while the application runs. \n## What should you look for in a .NET Monitor?  An ideal .NET Performance Monitor must offer comprehensive and actionable information that software developers need to troubleshoot an application successfully. Some key components are: - Preemptive performance monitoring - Comprehensive full-stack performance monitoring - Intimate code insights  - Granular error identification mechanism  - Comprehensive .NET Framework, Common Language Runtime (CLR), and Internet Information Services (IIS) monitoring \n## What’s Included in this Pack: - High-value alerts  - Code-related insights that acquaint developers with the intricate details of their application’s health and status by providing detailed information on errors, database queries, and transaction traces  - Alerts that proactively inform developers about the status of their applications \n## What Makes This Pack Unique? With this quickstart, you can monitor health and status in one place, focus on the most important information, and enable preventative maintenance strategy. ",
